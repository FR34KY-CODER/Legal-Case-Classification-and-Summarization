12. Out of the 10 Bills reserved for her consideration, the President withheld

              assent to seven Bills, granted assent to one Bill and is yet to consider the

              remaining two Bills.

13. The status of the Bills is summarized below:

into cases of corruption against public servants.
14. Between 10.04.2022 and 15.05.2023, the Government of Tamil Nadu

              submitted to the Governor, four files relating to the prosecution of public

              servants involved in crimes of moral turpitude under the
Prevention of

              Corruption Act, 1988

              remained pending with the Governor.

20. In regard to the aforesaid, the petitioner forwarded representations to the

of members in TNPSC and carrying out their appointments. The petitioner

     also sent reminders to the Principal Secretary to the Governor for acting on

     the files sent to the Governor’s office in this respect.


23. The petitioner explained this position and also addressed the queries raised

     by the Governor in its clarification note dated 07.10.2023. The files for

approval of appointments were accordingly re-submitted on 10.10.2023,

     however, the same were returned by the Governor on 27.10.2023 without

     assigning any reasons.
v.   Factual background with respect to dismissal of ministers and
     allocation of ministries.

b) Justiciability and Judicial Review.





vi)   Mr. Dwivedi submitted that issues of repugnance of State

         legislation with a Central enactment are not of easy determination

         and the only method of discourse between the Governor and the
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 31 of 414
State Legislature is provided in the first proviso to
Article 200.
Hence, simpliciter withholding of assent without taking recourse to

         the first proviso ought to be rejected by the Courts and compliance

         with the first proviso ought to be mandated in every case of

         withholding of assent. Furthermore, issues of repugnance should be

         left for the constitutional courts to decide.



W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                         Page 33 of 414
e) Reservation of bills for the consideration of the President.



Gubernatorial procrastination is a new phenomenon and requires

         judicial intervention for finding a new solution for it within the

         Constitutional framework.



ix)   He further submitted that the said observations in
B.K. Pavitra
(supra) should be interpreted to mean that even though the power

         under
Article 200
is entrusted to the Governor, yet such exercise of

         power can only be done with the aid and advice of the Council of

         Ministers of the State. The Governor has no independent discretion

         under the substantive part of
Article 200
for referring the bill for

         the consideration of the President. As is crystal clear from the

         Constituent Assembly Debates, there is no independent discretion

         vested in the Governor in exercise of his functions under
Article

         200
of the Constitution. Although the power of reserving Bills for

         the consideration of the President is a necessary channel for

         references under
Article 254(2)
to save the competence of the State

         Legislatures from being unduly restricted by the operation of the

         rule of repugnancy embodied in Clause (1) of the
Article 254
, yet

         such power is also subject to the aid and advice of the Council of

         Ministers.

If the answer is yes, then the Governor must reserve the Bill for

            the consideration of the President.

C.        ISSUES FOR CONSIDERATION
iv. Whether the scheme of
Article 200
of the Constitution envisages

            the exercise of ‘absolute veto’ or ‘pocket veto’ of a bill by the

            Governor?
i. Whether the reservation by the Governor, for the consideration of

           the President of the ten Bills which were repassed by the Tamil

           Nadu State Assembly and presented to the Governor on

           18.11.2023, is erroneous in law and hence liable to be set aside?



III)   Whether there is an express constitutionally prescribed time-limit
       within which the Governor is required to act in the exercise of his
       powers under
Article 200
of the Constitution?
iii. Whether a time-limit can be prescribed by this Court for ensuring

          that the exercise of power by the Governor under
Article 200
is in

          conformity with the object of expediency underlying the scheme of

          the said provision?
IV)   Whether the Governor in the exercise of his powers under
Article
      200
of the Constitution can only act in accordance with the aid and
      advice tendered to him by the State Council of Ministers? If not,
      whether the constitutional scheme has vested the Governor with
      some discretion in discharge of his functions under
Article 200?
i. How has the role of the Governor been envisaged under the

          constitutional scheme?
ii. Whether the Governor enjoys a certain degree of discretion in

          discharge of his functions in contrast to the President? What is the

          source of such discretion, if any?
iii. Whether the deletion of the expression “in his discretion” from
Article 175
of the Draft Constitution imply that the Governor has
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 63 of 414
no discretion available in the exercise of his powers under
Article

          200?
i. Whether the discharge of functions by the Governor under
Article

          200
of the Constitution in his discretion could be said to be immune

          from judicial review?
ii. Whether the withholding of assent by the President under
Article

          201
of the Constitution could also be said to be beyond the scope

          of judicial scrutiny?
i. Whether the decision of the President to withhold assent under
Article 201
of the Constitution could be said to be justiciable? If

               yes, what is the extent of justiciability that the courts can embark

               upon while undertaking judicial review of the exercise of powers

               by the President under
Article 201
of the Constitution?
D.     ASSENT TO BILLS – HISTORICAL BACKGROUND







II. Provincial Governments
9. All Bills passed by the Council shall have to receive the
        assent of the Governor-General before they become law.”

78. The first proviso, according to him, was therefore a saving clause which

        vested power in the hands of the Ministry to remedy a hasty action that they

91. One of the questions on which the Commission addressed itself was whether

    the Constitution provides for the exercise of any power by the Governor in

    his discretion that is, whether the Governor could exercise any of his

    functions without consulting the Ministry or contrary to the aid and advice

    tendered by the Council of Ministers.



iii.    Sarkaria Commission

101. To the limited extent of studying the issues arising from the exercise of

     powers under
Articles 200
and
201
respectively, the Commission addressed

     itself on the following broad points:
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 109 of 414

ii. Bills which may be reserved for President's
                consideration and assent for specific purposes
19. These are Bills for—
iii. Bills which may not specifically fall under any of the
                   above categories, yet may be reserved by the
                   Governor for President's consideration under Article
200.”
                                           (Emphasis supplied)
iv.    Punchhi Commission
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 121 of 414

c.    Expediency in Disposal of Bills – Timelines Suggested by the
      Report of the Commission
within which the Governor should take a decision whether to
             grant assent or to reserve it for the consideration of the
             President;
142. The report of the Punchhi Commission advocated for the immediate

     implementation of the above-mentioned recommendations by way of a

     Constitutional Amendment.
26. Insofar as Money Bills are concerned, the power of the
        Governor to return a Bill in terms of the first proviso is
        excluded from the purview of the constitutional power of the
        Governor. Money Bills are governed by
Article 207
in terms
        of which the recommendation of the Governor is required for
        the introduction of the Bill on a matter specified in sub-
        clauses (a) to (f) of clause (1) of Article 199.”

                                           (Emphasis supplied)
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 156 of 414
321. The question which naturally follows is whether the exercise of discretion

    by the Governor, in the exceptional situations as discussed aforesaid, would

    be amenable to judicial review. The importance of this question lies in the

    high constitutional importance of the role which the Governor plays under
Article 200.
The Governor, by choosing to act in his discretion under
Article

    200
, has the power to thwart the entire legislative machinery of the State by

    reserving a bill for the consideration of the President. He also has the power

    to significantly delay the grant of assent to a bill by withholding assent and

    returning the same to the State legislature under the first proviso to
Article

    200
of the Constitution.","For the convenience of the exposition, this judgment is divided in the following

parts:
4. The Bill falls, mainly, within the scope of the following
             entries of the Union, State and Concurrent. Lists In the
             Seventh Schedule to the Constitution, namely-
25. In a similar case, Dr. K. Ponmudy, a minister in the Government of Tamil

     Nadu was convicted and sentenced by the Madras High Court against which,

     he filed an appeal before this Court. This Court, vide order dated 11.03.2024,

     suspended the conviction of Dr. K. Ponmudy from its operation keeping in

     view
Section 8(3)
of the Representation of People’s Act, 1951 and more
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 22 of 414
particularly for the reason that he should not suffer disqualification from the

    office of Member of Legislative Assembly.
29. This Court heard the application on 22.03.2024 and expressed its displeasure

     at the reluctance of the Governor to accept the order of this Court dated

     11.03.2024 suspending the sentence of Dr. K. Ponmudy. This prompted the

     Governor to swear in Dr. K. Ponmudy as Minister in the State Cabinet and

     the I.A. was disposed of accordingly recording the same.

ii)   In furtherance of the aforesaid submission, he drew our attention to

         the decision in
S.R. Bommai v. Union of India
reported in (1994)

         3 SCC 1 wherein the justiciability of a proclamation under
Article

         356
was propounded.
He also relied upon the decisions of this

         Court in
Rameshwar Prasad v. Union of India
reported in (
2006)

         2 SCC 1 and Kihoto Holohan v. Zachillhu
reported in 1992 Supp

         (2) SCC 651 wherein the exercise of power of the Governor to

         invite the leader of the majority party to form government and the
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 28 of 414
power of the Speaker under the 10th Schedule to the Constitution

          were respectively held to be justiciable by this Court.
ii)    He submitted that this Court has been consistent in its approach

          while interpreting the constitutional provisions, more particularly
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                           Page 29 of 414
those that pertain to the Governor or the President, in light of the

          fundamental       principles   of   Parliamentary   democracy    and

          federalism. He placed reliance on the decisions of this Court in
Samsher Singh v. State of Punjab
reported in (1974) 2
SCC 831,

          S.R. Bommai
(supra), Nabam Rebia & Bamang Felix v. Dy.

          Speaker, Arunachal Pradesh Legislative Assembly reported in

          (2016) 8 SCC 1 in support of the aforesaid submission.
National Textile Corporation (Maharashtra North) Ltd. and Ors.

             reported in (2002) 8 SCC 182, a Constitution Bench of this Court

             held that the Central law with which repugnance exists must be

             pointed out by the proposal of State government specifically. Even

             the nature of repugnance should be stated so as to enable the

             President to consider the nature, extent, feasibility, practicality and

             desirability of assenting.
v)    Placing reliance on the Constitution Bench decision in
Samsher

         Singh
(supra), he submitted that although the executive power of

         the State is vested in the Governor yet it is actually carried on by

         the Ministers under the Rules of Business made under
Article

         166(3).
Further, the President or the Governor act on the aid and

         advice of the Council of Ministers with the Prime Minister as the

         head in the case of the Union and the Chief Minister as the head in

         the case of States, in all matters which vest in the Executive,

         irrespective of whether those functions are executive or legislative

         in character.
vi)   Referring to the observations made by a Constitution Bench of this

         Court in Nabam Rebia (supra), it was submitted that the Governor

         cannot be entrusted with such powers and functions as would assign

         to him a dominating position over the State Executive and the State

         Legislature. The Governor cannot be accepted as an all-pervading

         super-constitutional authority. It was submitted that an examination

         of the executive and legislative functions of the Governor in the
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 37 of 414
context of the constitutional scheme clearly brings out that the

         Governor has not been assigned any substantive role either in the

         executive or the legislative functioning of the State.
vii) It was argued that this Court in Nabam Rabia (supra) has gone

         further to say that any exercise of discretionary powers of the

         Governor is limited to situations where a constitutional provision

         expressly provides that the Governor should act in his own

         discretion. Additionally, a Governor may exercise his functions in

         his own discretion in situations where the constitutional provision

         concerned cannot be construed otherwise and in situations where

         the clear intent underlying a constitutional provision so requires

         i.e., where the exercise of such power on the aid and advice, would

         run contrary to the constitutional scheme, or would be contradictory

         in terms.
viii) In response to our specific question as regards the observations

         made by this Court in
B.K. Pavitra v. Union of India
reported in

         (2019) 6 SCC 129, that the eventuality in
Article 254(2)
does not

         exhaust the ambit of the power entrusted to the Governor under
Article 200
to reserve a Bill for the consideration of the President,

         he submitted that the Governor may legitimately refer a bill for
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                         Page 38 of 414
consideration at the end of the President upon entertaining a

         legitimate doubt about the validity of law. However, such reference

         of a bill can only be done with the aid and advice of the Council of

         Ministers and not upon the individual discretion of the Governor.
iii)   On the use of the expression “may” in the first proviso to

, placing reliance on the decision of this Court in
State of Uttar

          Pradesh v. Jogendra Singh
reported in AIR 1963 SC 1618 the

          counsel submitted that in
the said decision
while adjudicating the

          duty of the Governor to refer the cases relating to Government

          servants to the Administrative Tribunal under Rules 4(2) of the

          Civil Service Rules which also used the expression “may” this

          Court had held that the word “may” is capable of meaning “must”

          or “shall” in the light of the context. He further submitted that

          where a discretion is conferred upon a public authority coupled

          with an obligation, the word “may” which denotes discretion

          should be construed to mean a command. Sometimes, the

          legislature uses the word “may” out of deference to the high status

          of the authority on whom the power and the obligation are intended

          to be conferred and imposed.
iv)    The first part of the first proviso is mandatory in nature. It

          authorises the Governor to, as soon as possible, after the

          presentation for Bill for assent, return the Bill together with a

          message requesting the House to reconsider the Bill with the

          desirability of introducing any such amendments as he may

          recommend in his message. He submitted that this interpretation
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 43 of 414
was also followed by this Court in the decision in
State of Punjab
(supra) by stating that Governor must mandatorily follow the

         course of action indicated in the first proviso of communicating to

         the State Legislature “as soon as possible” a message warranting

         reconsideration of the Bill.
ii)   The counsel placed reliance on the following decisions of this Court

         in support of his submission:
e) The observations made by this Court in its decision in Valluri
   Basavaiah Chowdhary are not applicable to the present case
i)     Mr. Singhvi submitted that this Court in
Valluri Basavaiah

          Chowdhary
(supra) had no occasion to adjudicate upon the
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                   Page 47 of 414
interpretation of the constitutional powers of the Governor under
Article 200
of the Constitution. Therefore, the observations of the

          Court in Para 19 cannot be construed to be its ratio decidendi. At

          most, these observations could be considered as obiter dicta.

          Indeed, they may not even constitute obiter but are mere

          observations, totally unconnected to and unnecessary for that case.
ii)    He relied upon the decision of this Court in Secunderabad Club v.
Commissioner of Income-Tax reported in (2023) SCC OnLine

          SC 1004 to submit that in terms of
Article 141
of the Constitution,

          only the ratio decidendi of a judgment, that is, the reason assigned

          in support of the conclusion, is binding. He submitted that this

          Court has held that what is binding, therefore, is the principle

          underlying a decision which must be discerned in the context of the

          question(s) involved
in that case
from which the decision takes its

          colour. In a subsequent case, a decision cannot be relied upon in

          support of a proposition that it did not decide. Therefore, the

          context or the question, while considering which, a judgment has

          been rendered assumes significance.
ii)   It was submitted that when the Petitioner had approached this Court

         initially, the Governor had kept 12 Bills pending. Thereafter, the

         captioned Writ Petitions were heard by this Court on 10.11.2023

         wherein it was observed that the present Writ Petition raised a

         matter of serious concern and issued notice to the Union of India

         represented by the Secretary to the Government in the Ministry of

         Home Affairs. In light of the aforesaid, the Governor hastily on

         13.11.2023 referred two Bills for the consideration of the President

         and withheld assent simpliciter to the remaining 10 Bills. On

         18.11.2023, a special session of Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly

         was held and the 10 Bills were reconsidered and passed in the

         Assembly. These Bills were sent to the Governor for consideration
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 51 of 414
on the same day itself. However, the Governor, with a view to

                render the present petition infructuous, reserved the 10 Bills for the

                consideration of the President.
iii)   In the last, the learned counsel submitted that the action of the

                Governor has been contrary to what was laid down by this Court in
S.R. Bommai
(supra) wherein it was stated that the Governor is a

                very high Constitutional functionary and he is supposed to act fairly

                and honestly, in a manner consistent with his oath. It is for this

                reason that
Article 356
places such implicit faith on his report. If,

                however, in a given case his report is vitiated by legal mala fides,

                it is bound to vitiate the President's action as well.
h. He submitted that on a proper reading of the substantive part and the

     first proviso to
Article 200
, it will be seen that four courses of actions

     are available to the Governor. The observations made in the
State of

     Punjab
(supra) decision may thus warrant a qualification, or

     an additional statement to fine-tune the scope of Article 200.



i.   On the issue as regards whether the first proviso is attracted in all

     instances of withholding of assent, he submitted that the role for the first

     proviso is confined to cases where the bill may not be hit by any
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                          Page 57 of 414
constitutional limitation, is within the competence of the legislature, but

     may admit of changes, amendments, etc. Such amendments or changes

     that the Governor may thus suggest within the scope of the first proviso,

     will not be relatable to matters such as repugnancy. With the perception

     of repugnancy, the focus of the Governor will be outside the first

     proviso.
He argued that even though this Court in
State of Punjab
(supra) has opined that the exercise of power under the first proviso is

     relatable to the withholding of the assent by the Governor, yet this view

     may require a further qualification that in the context of repugnancy,

     unlike any other reason for withholding of assent, the Governor need not

     necessarily proceed to act under the first proviso. The first proviso

     perhaps cannot be read to be pressed into service when both the

     Governor and the State Government understand the repugnancy

     dimension. In the event the State Government desires to clear the

     repugnancy or any other hurdle, it may itself seek the assent of the

     President. In such an event the State Government may also ask the

     Governor to refer the matter to the President for consideration.
j.   He submitted that that in the present case as the President has withheld

     assent to the Bills in question, therefore in terms of the statement of law

     in Hoechst Pharamaceuticals (supra), the action of the President in

     withholding assent is not justiciable. What cannot be directly done by
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                         Page 58 of 414
seeking such justiciability cannot be indirectly achieved by the claim

         that the action of the Governor in forwarding the bills in question to the

         President was beyond his authority.
k. He submitted that the exposition of
Article 200
as done in
State of

         Punjab
(supra) is sub-silentio as the Court while making
the said

         decision
did not take into account the observations made by the

         Constitution Bench in
Valluri Basavaiah
(supra).
l.   In the last, he submitted that the matter may be referred to a larger Bench

         of this Court so as to harmonise the observations made in
B.K. Pavitra
(supra),
Valluri Basavaiah
(supra) and
State of Punjab
(supra).
c. Placing      reliance    on    the    decision     of      this    Court     in
Purushothaman Nambudiri v. State of Kerala
reported in 1961 SCC

           OnLine SC 361 he submitted that the idea of reading in a time limit in
Articles 200
and
201
respectively had been deliberated upon and

           expressly rejected by this Court in
the said decision
.
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                            Page 61 of 414
iii. Whether the decision of this Court in
State of Punjab
(supra)

            could be said to be per incuriam for not having taken into

            consideration the observations made in previous decisions

            rendered by larger benches of this Court?
iv. Whether the observations of this Court in
B.K. Pavitra
(supra) that

          “a discretion is conferred upon the Governor to follow one of the

          courses of action enunciated in the substantive part of Article 200”

          could be said to be per incuriam for having failed to notice the

          position of law as
laid down by
the larger Benches of this Court?



V)    Whether the exercise of discretion by the Governor in discharge of
      his functions under
Article 200
could be said to be subject to
      judicial review? If yes, what are the parameters for such judicial
      review?
iii. If the aforesaid discharge of functions is subject to judicial review,

          whether such discharge of functions could be said to be non-

          justiciable in light of the decisions of this Court in Hoechst

          (supra), Kaiser-I-Hind (supra), and
B.K. Pavitra
(supra)?
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                         Page 64 of 414
VI)   What is the manner in which the President under
Article 201
of the
           Constitution is required to act once a bill has been reserved for his
           consideration by the Governor under
Article 200
of the
           Constitution?
40. D.D. Basu in his Commentary on the Constitution of India (pp. 6311, 8th

     Ed., 2009) has observed that the omission of the expression “in his

     discretion” from
Article 200
signifies that the Governor must exercise his

     power under the Article according to the advice of his ministers. Further, the
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 67 of 414
addition of the expression “shall not withhold assent therefrom” indicates

     that the Governor has no power to veto a reconsidered bill and must assent

     to it whether it is passed in the original form or with amendments.
42. It is important to note that the expression “shall” has been used to qualify

     the three types of declarations that the Governor can make upon presentation

     of the bill to him. Further, the three options provided in the substantive part

     of
Article 200
are connected by the conjunction “or” which signifies that the

     three options are mutually exclusive of each other, and the Governor can

     only choose one of them at a time. In other words, the Governor cannot

     assent to a bill and also reserve it for the consideration of the President at
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 68 of 414
the same time. Similarly, the Governor cannot declare that he withholds

assent and also reserve the bill for the consideration of the President at the

same time. Patanjali Sastri, Chief Justice (as he then was), observed to this

effect in
State of Bihar v. Kameshwar Singh
reported in (1952) 1 SCC 528

as follows:
48. Jessica J. Richardson2 in her paper titled “Modernisation of Royal Assent in

      Canada”, has traced the historical origins of the practice of granting assent

      to bills enacted by the Parliament in the United Kingdom. She has explained

      that the practice of signifying royal assent to bills passed by Parliament

      began during the reign of Henry VI (1422-71), when the practice of

      introducing bills in the form of petitions was replaced by bills in the form of

      complete statutes. This was a time when assent was granted in person. The

      Sovereign would attend the Parliament in the House of Lords and give his

      consent in person. This practice continued until 1541, when the task of

      signifying royal assent was assigned to a Royal Commission in order to

      spare King Henry VIII the indignity of having to give royal assent to the Bill

      of Attainder, which provided for the execution of his wife Catherine

      Howard. It was after this occurrence that the practice of appointing Lords

      Commissioners responsible for giving royal assent developed. In the United

      Kingdom, the last instance of a monarch giving royal assent in person was

W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                                   Page 72 of 414
in 1854 when Queen Victoria personally assented to several bills prior to

     proroguing the Parliament. However, in Canada, King George VI gave royal

     assent in person to bills passed by the Canadian Parliament in 1939 during

     a visit to Canada. The use of a royal assent ceremony continued in the United

     Kingdom until 1967, when the British Parliament passed the Royal Assent

     Act, 1967. The said legislation repealed the Royal Assent by Commission

     Act, 1541 and allowed a simple report of royal assent by the Speakers of the

     two Houses to give a bill the force of law.
General it shall be lawful for His Majesty in Council to
            signify his disallowance of the Act.
59. In 1944, the All India Hindu Mahasabha adopted the Constitution of

    Hindustan Free State Act as an aspirational constitutional document. As
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 82 of 414
regards the procedure of assent by Governor in provinces, the document

    contained the following provision:
However, the Governor continued to have some special responsibilities and

     he also possessed discretionary powers to act in situations such as prevention

     of grave menace to the peace or tranquility of the province, safeguarding the

     legitimate interests of minorities and so on. The Governor could also act in

     his discretion in specified matters. He functioned under the general
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 88 of 414
superintendence and control of the Governor-General, whenever he acted in

     his individual judgement or discretion.
68. It is interesting to note that while the framing of the Constitution was being

     undertaken by the Constituent Assembly, the GoI Act, 1935 as adapted by

     the India (Provisional Constitution) Order, 1947 was made applicable for

     the administration of the country. By way of paragraph 3 of the said order,

     the expressions “in his discretion”, “acting in his discretion” and “exercising

     his individual judgement” were removed/deleted from wherever they

     occurred in the GoI Act, 1935. Paragraph 3 read thus:
76. On the other hand, during the course of the debate, Shri. Shibban Lal Saxena,

        addressed the practical realities of assigning such a discretion to the

        Governor who is a nominee of the President, especially when the party in

        power in the province may not be the same as the party in power at the

        Centre. In such a scenario, it was his opinion that, “it will introduce a very

        wrong principle to give the Governor this power to go against the express

        wish of the Assembly and even of the council”4.
81. Such a clause was initially supposed to be included in the Fourth Schedule

    that separately contained instructions to the Governors of the States.

    However, since it was considered unnecessary to have such a separate

    Schedule, this particular aspect was sought to be brought in as second

    proviso to the draft
Article 175.
A need to incorporate the second proviso

    was felt because the High Courts were placed under the legislative

    competence of the Centre as well as the States. In so far as the organization

    and territorial jurisdiction of the High Court was concerned, the power

    remained with the Centre. However, with regard to the pecuniary

    jurisdiction and the jurisdiction in relation to any of the matters which are

    mentioned under List II, the power rests with different States. Therefore,

    there could arise a scenario wherein the State legislature would enact a bill

    which would derogate from the powers of the High Court. For example,

    passing a bill that reduces the pecuniary jurisdiction of the High Court by

    raising the value of the suit that may be entertained by the High Court. This

    would be one method whereby the State legislature would diminish the

    authority of the High Court. Furthermore, a bill could also affect the subject-

    matter jurisdiction of a High Court. For example, in enacting any measure

    under any of the entries contained in List II, say, debt cancellation, it would

    be open for the provinces or States to say that the decree made by any such
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 97 of 414
Court or Board shall be final and conclusive, and that the High Court should

        not have any jurisdiction in the matter at all. In light of such possibilities, it

        was felt that the second proviso to draft
Article 175
must be added.
86. While examining the various facets of Centre-State relations, the

    Commission found it apposite to discuss the role of the Governor in the

    political context which existed back then. Taking note of the skirmishes

    between the State governments and Governors, the Commission was of the

    view that the Governor’s office ceased to be merely ornamental and

    ceremonial. This changed role demanded a scrutiny of the discretionary

    powers of the Governor.
88. The ARC, therefore, recommended the following:
92. To answer this question, the Commission adverted to the history of the

    making of the Constitution and concluded that the Constitution does not

    provide for the issue of any instructions to the Governor, nor does it vest any

    discretionary powers in express terms in the Governor, except in relation to

    certain specified matters. While referring to certain judicial pronouncements

    of this Court as well as Granville Austin’s seminal work on the Indian

    Constitution, the Commission opined that the discretion of the Governor

    must be limited to those matters in respect of which there are express

    provisions in the Constitution. The relevant portion of the report is

    reproduced below:
94. However, in the same vein, it was also noted that the Governor has to

    function in a dual capacity as (1) the appointee of the central government;
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 104 of 414
and (2) the constitutional head of the State. This is because the Central

       Government retains the power to appoint and remove the Governor,

       therefore, the Governor cannot but look to the Central Government for

       guidance in the discharge of his duties.
97. In June 1983, the Central government headed by the former Prime Minister

    of India, Ms. Indira Gandhi, formally constituted a commission to examine

    and review the working of the arrangements between the Union and States

    in regard to powers, functions and responsibilities in all spheres and to

    recommend such changes or other measures as may be deemed appropriate.

    The said commission was formed under the chairmanship of a former judge

    of this Court, Justice R.S. Sarkaria and hence, came to be known as the

    Sarkaria Commission.
104. According to the Commission, the scheme of the Constitution indicates that

    the Governor’s opinion at best, is persuasive. The Governor cannot, in any

    circumstance, exercise dictatorial powers to override or veto the decisions

    or proposals of his Council of Ministers. The scope of discretionary powers

    should be construed in the context of a parliamentary democracy with a

    responsible government. In such a form of government, the role of a formal

    head of the State cannot be enlarged at the cost of the real executive, which

    enjoys the confidence of the people as it is responsible to the State

    legislature.
116. Since, conditional assent may become a tool for the Centre to dictate its

     policies to the States by attaching conditions to Presidential assent, the

     Commission, in cognizance of the impropriety of such a practice,

     recommended that in cases where the Union Government is of the opinion

     that some amendments to a State bill are essential before it becomes a law,

     such bill should be returned through the Governor to the State legislature for

     reconsideration in terms of the proviso to Article 201.

Governor.
127. Another Commission on Centre-State relations was constituted by the

      Government of India in 2007 under the chairmanship of Justice Madan

      Mohan Punchhi, the former Chief Justice of India. The Commission was

      tasked with the mandate of reviewing the existing arrangements between the

      Union and States as per the Constitution of India in regard to powers,

      functions and responsibilities in all spheres including legislative relations,

      administrative relations, role of Governors, emergency provisions, etc. and

      recommending such changes as may be appropriate keeping in view

      practical difficulties, growing challenges of ensuring good governance and

      the need for strengthening the unity and integrity of the country.
130. The Commission observed that the nature and scope of rights and powers of

     the Governor should be understood in the context of a Cabinet system of

     government. Under such system, the Governor performs a multi-faceted

     role. First, as constitutional head of the State, he has a right to be consulted,

     to warn and encourage. In performance of this role, the Constitution makers

     ideated the office of Governor to perform the role of a “a friend, philosopher

     and guide” to his Council of Ministers. Secondly, the Governor functions as

     a sentinel of the Constitution and acts as the Union’s representative in the

     State. As observed by this Court in
Rameshwar Prasad & Ors. v. Union of

     India
reported in (2006) 2 SCC 1, the Governor discharges “dual

     responsibility” to the Union and State.
131. Further, the Constitution affords the Governor only a persuasive role and not

     dictatorial powers to override or veto the decisions or proposals of his

     Council of Ministers. The Commission observed that the Governor, at best,

     has powers of giving advice or counselling for further reflection of the

     decision taken by the Council of Ministers. The Governor only flags a need

     for caution for the purpose of bridging the understanding between the

     Government and opposition (if there are different governments at the central

     and state level).
135. In continuation to the Sarkaria Commission’s views on the question of

     discretionary powers of the Governor, the Punchhi Commission report also

     asserts that the area for the exercise of discretion is limited and even in this

     limited area, the Governor’s choice of action should neither be nor appear to

     be arbitrary or fanciful. It must be a choice dictated by reason, actuated by

     good faith and tempered with caution.
143. The tenets of parliamentary democracy demand that while the head of state

     must act on the advice of ministers, the ministers, in turn, must uphold their

     responsibility to the people when providing that advice. Indeed, the very

     raison d’être of a democratic government is to uphold the primacy of the

     Parliament by ensuring executive accountability. This has been aptly put
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 128 of 414
forth by Nicholas Barber, Professor of Constitutional Law and Theory at the

      Oxford University, in his work ‘Can Royal Assent Be Refused on the Advice

      of the Prime Minister?’7 wherein he argues:
145. In Parliament of the UK, the procedure for obtaining Royal Assent begins

       with officials in the Public Bill Office of the House of Lords that manages

       and assists the processes relating to the House’s consideration of public

       legislation. First, a list of bills is prepared by the Clerk of the Parliaments.

       Thereafter, once a date for Royal Assent has been set, all the bills approved

       by both Houses are presented before the monarch for assent. In this regard,

       the monarch has no power to withhold assent to a bill, regardless of any

       instructions from the Government or anyone else.8 In Scotland, a period of

       four weeks is allowed before a bill is presented to the Queen for assent,

       during which any legal objections may be raised.
Traditionally, once a bill was passed in identical form by both the Senate

     and the House of Commons, the Governor General, as the Crown’s

     representative, attended the Parliament to provide Royal Assent to such bill.

     In absence of the Governor General, a Justice of the Supreme Court of

     Canada acting as Deputy to the Governor General is presented the bills for

     Royal Assent. The Governor General signs a Declaration of Royal Assent,

     witnessed by the Clerk of the Parliaments.
149. The Supreme Court of Canada in Reference Re Amendment of the

    Constitution of Canada, reported in 1981 SCC OnLine Can SC 77,

    recognized that, by convention, neither the Queen nor the vice-regal

    representative (equivalent of a Governor in India) may, on their own, refuse

    assent to a bill passed by both Houses of the Parliament on the grounds of

    opposition to or disapproval of its policy. The relevant portion of the

    judgment in reference reads thus:
150. In Galati v. Governor-General of Canada, reported in [2015] FC 91, the

    Federal Court of Canada was faced with the question of whether the grant

    of royal assent by the Governor General to the Strengthening Canadian

    Citizenship Act, 2014 could be set aside by the court on the ground that

    enactment of the same was outside the legislative competence of the

    Parliament. It was contended by the applicants that the Governor General

    exceeded the scope of his discretion as well as his authority under the Royal

    Assent Act of Canada by assenting to the said bill. The Federal Court,

    however, dismissed the application and held that the Governor General’s act

    of affixing royal assent to the bill was a legislative act. Therefore, the issue
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 133 of 414
of whether the Governor General exceeded his constitutional authority in

     granting royal assent to the said bill was not justiciable. The relevant portion

     of the judgment is reproduced below for ready reference:
151. The views of the Federal Court in Galati (supra) that the grant of royal

     assent by the Governor-General was a legislative act and hence, non-

     justiciable was in line with the view of the Court in Gallant v. The King,

     [1949] 2 DLR 425 wherein it was noted that the Lieutenant-Governor is a

     part of the legislature and the act of providing royal assent is also a

     legislative action.
h.    Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka
174. In other words, his contention was that simpliciter withholding is to be opted

     for by the Governor in his position as a custodian of the Constitution in the

     State, while the procedure prescribed in the first proviso is to be followed

     by him in his role as a friend, philosopher and guide of the State

     Government, with a view to improve an otherwise constitutionally

     innocuous piece of legislation.
175. The aforesaid contention of the Attorney General was met by the petitioner

     by placing reliance on the recent decision of this Court in
State of Punjab
(supra) wherein it was held that the option of withholding of assent under

     the substantive part of
Article 200
is attached with the first proviso. The

     petitioner contended that in light of the said observation, it is not open for
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 147 of 414
the Governor to undertake any simpliciter withholding of a bill presented to

    him and he must mandatorily resort to the procedure indicated in the first

    proviso if he decides to withhold assent to a bill.
176. The Attorney General, on the other hand, raised doubts as regards the

    correctness of the decision in
State of Punjab
(supra) and argued that
the

    said decision
was rendered without having regard to the earlier decisions

    given by larger Benches of this Court.
In particular, he placed reliance on

    certain observations made by the Constitution Bench in
Valluri Basavaiah

    Chowdhary
(supra) to support his contention.
177.
In response, the petitioner argued in favour of the decision in
State of

    Punjab
(supra) and submitted that the observations made in
Valluri

    Basavaiah Chowdhary
(supra) were made in a case where this Court was

    not dealing with the interpretation of
Article 200
of the Constitution. Thus,

    the observations made therein as regards
Article 200
could be said to be

    obiter dicta at best. Mr. Dwivedi went to the extent of submitting that the

    observations of this Court being relied upon by the Attorney General cannot

    be construed as obiter dicta as they were mere passing remarks irrelevant to

    the lis before the Court
in that case
.
178. It is in this backdrop that we are called upon to ascertain whether the

    observations made in
Valluri Basavaiah Chowdhary
(supra) can be

    reconciled with the decision of this Court in
State of Punjab
(supra). The

    consequence of this inquiry would be that it would determine whether the

    constitutional scheme of
Article 200
envisages a simpliciter withholding of

    assent by the Governor.
In other words, if the decision in
State of Punjab
(supra) is found to be per incuriam, it would mean that the Governor under
Article 200
has the power of exercising an absolute veto upon any bill which

    is presented to him for assent.
179. Before going into the question of whether the observations made in
Valluri

    Basavaiah Chowdhary
(supra) could be said to be the ratio, obiter or

    irrelevant to the lis, we deem it necessary to reproduce the observations

    relied upon by the Attorney General in support of his submission:
180. The crux of the controversy as regards whether the first proviso provides an

     independent course of action to the Governor lies in the use of the expression

     “in which case the Bill falls through unless the procedure indicated in the

     first proviso is followed”. However, what is interesting to note is that this

     expression did not come to be used for the first time in
Valluri Basavaiah

     Chowdhary
(supra).
Much prior to
the said decision
, Justice S.R. Das (as

     his lordship then was), in a concurring opinion in
State of Bihar v.

     Maharajadhiraja Sir Kameshwar Singh of Darbhanga
reported in (1952)

     1 SCC 528 observed as follows:
24. The substantive part of
Article 200
empowers the
        Governor to withhold assent to the Bill. In such an event, the
        Governor must mandatorily follow the course of action which
        is indicated in the first proviso of communicating to the State
        Legislature “as soon as possible” a message warranting the
        reconsideration of the Bill. The expression “as soon as
        possible” is significant. It conveys a constitutional
        imperative of expedition. Failure to take a call and keeping a
        Bill duly passed for indeterminate periods is a course of
        action inconsistent with that expression. Constitutional
        language is not surplusage. In State of Telangana v.
Governor of Telangana [State of Telangana v. Governor of
        Telangana
, (2024) 1 SCC 405] this Court observed that “The
        expression ‘as soon as possible’ has significant
        constitutional content and must be borne in mind by
        constitutional authorities.” The Constitution evidently
        contains this provision bearing in mind the importance which
        has been attached to the power of legislation which squarely
        lies in the domain of the State Legislature. The Governor
        cannot be at liberty to keep the Bill pending indefinitely
        without any action whatsoever.
185. As the observation made by this Court in the three decisions
referred to

    above
holds that the Bill would fall through unless the procedure prescribed

    in the first proviso is followed, we first need to understand the procedure

    that is prescribed in the first proviso. The proviso stipulates that when any
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 157 of 414
bill, other than a Money Bill, is presented to the Governor for assent, he

     may, as soon as possible, return it to the State legislature, together with a

     message. As regards the contents of the message, the proviso stipulates that

     the Governor may request the House(s) of the State legislature to reconsider

     the bill or certain parts of it, and also explore the desirability of introducing

     certain amendments as may be suggested by the Governor in the message.

     Once the bill is so returned together with the message, the House(s) are

     required to reconsider the bill in accordance with the recommendations

     contained in the message of the Governor. If the bill is then passed again by

     the House(s), with or without amendments, and presented to the Governor,

     then the Governor cannot withhold assent from such a bill.
191. Another important aspect that may be pointed out is that the observations

    made in
Valluri Basavaiah Chowdhary
(supra) and Hoechst (supra),

    respectively state that except in the case of a Money Bill, the Governor may

    withhold assent. A bare reading of
Article 200
indicates that there is no

    restriction in the substantive part that prohibits the Governor from declaring

    that he withholds assent to a Money Bill, and it is only under the first proviso

    that such a restriction can be found. Therefore, it is only when the option of

    the withholding of assent in the substantive part of
Article 200
is read along

    with the first proviso that Money Bills could be said to be excluded from the

    purview of withholding of assent under the substantive part of
Article 200.
Thus, rather than fortifying the argument of the learned Attorney General,

    the observations made in
Valluri Basavaiah Chowdhary
(supra) and

    reiterated in Hoechst (supra) only reinforce the intricate and inseparable

    connection between the exercise of the option of withholding of assent by

    the Governor and coming into operation of the procedure prescribed in the
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 162 of 414
first proviso.
The dictum of the above mentioned two decisions in no way

    renders the decision in
State of Punjab
(supra) per-incuriam, and rather

    bolsters the line of reasoning adopted by this Court therein.

193. This Court in
Nambudiri
(supra) explained as to how the State legislature

    may cause a bill to fall through with which they no longer intend to proceed

    by not reconsidering and repassing it, once it has been returned by the

    Governor with the deceleration of withholding of assent. This Court held

    that the stage of assent could only be arrived at after the stage of
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 163 of 414
reconsideration and repassing by the State legislature has been successfully

    crossed. The relevant observations read as under: -




W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                         Page 168 of 414







209.
In light of the language of
Article 200
, and also keeping in mind its

    interpretation by this Court in
State of Punjab
(supra), there was no room

    for the Governor to declare a simpliciter withholding of assent without

    taking recourse to the first proviso as that virtually amounts to the exercise

    of absolute veto by the Governor, a power which is conspicuously absent

    from our constitutional scheme.

W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 174 of 414

214. Refuting the contention of the petitioner, the learned Attorney General

     argued that in the absence of any prescribed time-limit in the text of the

     provision, it would not be open to the Court to read in a time-limit and the

     only way to do so would be by way of a constitutional amendment. He

     placed reliance on the decision of this Court in
Nambudiri
(supra) to argue

     that this Court had expressly rejected the idea that there is a time limit which

     circumscribes the exercise of functions of the Governor under
Article 200.
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 175 of 414

223. What can be postulated from this discussion of the relevant Constituent

        Assembly debates is that although our constitutional makers expressed their

        concerns for the possibility of an undue delay in the legislative process on

        account of the human nature to procrastinate, yet they nevertheless

        proceeded to adopt the phrase “as soon as possible” in the original
Article
11

, CONSTITUENT ASSEMB. DEB, (May 20, 1949) 194.

226. This Court in
Durga Pada Ghosh v. State of West Bengal
reported in (1972)

    2 SCC 656 whilst dealing with a writ in the nature of habeas corpus was

    called upon to examine the meaning and import of the expression “as soon

    as may be” appearing in
Article 22(5)
of the Constitution and its significance

    in communication of the grounds of detention and disposal of the

    representation of the detenu. In the said case, the detenu came to be arrested

    and put in preventive detention in December, 1971. The detenu moved a

    representation which was received in early January, 1972. However, his

    representation came to be considered by the State government therein only

    in February, 1972 and his detention was confirmed and communicated in

    March, 1972. The detenu challenged the order of preventive detention

    passed against him on the ground that there was an inordinate delay of

    almost two months on part of the State government in considering his

    representation even though the same had been received in January itself.

    This Court held that the aforesaid expression must be seen in the context of

    the scheme underlying
Article 22
, more particularly, the importance that it

    occupies in the constitutional set-up as regards the personal freedom of an
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 182 of 414
individual and in a manner whereby the provision does not lose both its

purpose and meaning. The words “as soon as may be” in such context

implies anxious care on the part of the authority concerned to perform its

duty in this respect, as early as practicable, without avoidable delay. The

course of action which is expected from the concerned authority; being

communication of the grounds of arrest and disposal of the representation,

was required to be considered with a sense of urgency and must be done

with due promptitude or expedition and with reasonable dispatch. It was

further held that although there is no definite time-limit which can be laid

down within which such actions must be done, yet at the same time, whether

the appropriate authority had disposed of its obligation as expeditiously as

possible ought to be looked into keeping in mind the peculiar facts and

circumstances of each case. It further held that such constitutional

obligations cannot be ignored or justified on reasons of administrative delay

except where it is shown that ample arrangements were made to cope with

the situation that led to a delay and a certain degree of priority was accorded.

The relevant observations read as under:
227.
In
Keisham
(supra) the question that arose before this Court was whether

    courts can direct the Speaker to decide disqualification petitions pending

    before it within a reasonable period of time, and this Court speaking

    eruditely through R.F. Nariman, J., answering the aforesaid question in an

    affirmative held as under:
(Emphasis supplied)
(ii)   Secondly, it observed that although Paragraph 6 of the Tenth

       Schedule vests the Speaker with an exclusive jurisdiction to decide

       disqualification petitions and ousts the reach of courts in such matters,

       yet it does not mean that there is no scope of judicial review by the

       courts or that the power to pass any direction(s) to the Speaker acting

       under the Tenth Schedule does not exist. It was observed that the true

       purport of such exclusive jurisdiction was only to ensure that no

       obstacle comes in the way of the Speaker in deciding such petitions
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 186 of 414
by way of injunctions from the courts. However, it by no means

        interdicts the exercise of judicial review in aiding a prompt decision

        on such disqualification petitions to ensure that the Speaker decides

        these issues within a reasonable period. The relevant observations

        read as under:
228. The aforesaid view was reiterated in
State of Telangana v. Governor of

    Telangana
reported in (2024) 1 SCC 405 wherein this Court whilst dealing

    with a similar issue pertaining to the pendency of a few bills before the

    Governor of Telangana, held that the expression “as soon as possible” in
Article 200
has significant constitutional content and must be borne in mind

    by the constitutional authorities. The relevant observations read as under:
229.
In
Ram Chand
(supra) certain parcels of land had been demarcated and

    declared for compulsory acquisition vide a notification, sometime between

    the years 1959-1965. However, the awards for compensation came to be

    passed almost fourteen-years later in the year 1980. These awards came to

    be challenged before this Court on the ground that since the statute in

    question provides for payment of compensation in respect of the acquisition

    made at the market value of the land, as it stood, at the time of publication

    of the notification for declaration, the same necessarily meant that

    compensation ought to be paid expeditiously and without delay. This Court

    held that although the legislature by way of an amendment has now

    prescribed a time-limit for making an award, yet it does not mean that prior

    to such amendment there was no time-limit for payment of compensation or

    that an award could be passed by the authorities at their own pace and

    leisure. It held that where for exercise of any power no time-limit has been

    prescribed, such power has to be exercised within a reasonable period of

    time. It further held that sans any fixed time-limit, such powers cannot be
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 189 of 414
exercised or subjected to delay in a manner that violates or circumvents the

object of the statute and the constitutional mandate under
Article 31A
of

timely acquisition and adequate compensation, respectively. The relevant

observations read as under:
230. In A.G. Perarivalan (supra) the facts germane for our discussion are that

    the appellant convict therein had filed a mercy petition under
Article 161
to

    the Governor in December, 2015. The State Cabinet recommended the grant

    of remission to the Governor in 2018. However, the Governor did not take

    any decision on the mercy petition for two years despite receiving the

    recommendation of the State Cabinet. Thereafter, upon a direction of this

    Court, the Governor in 2021, by an order, forwarded the mercy petition of

    the appellant to the President citing that the Union is the appropriate

    authority to decide the same. This reference came to be challenged before

    this Court wherein it was held as under:
Our Constitution, though federal in its
                 structure, is modelled on the British
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                     Page 192 of 414
parliamentary system where the executive is
                 deemed to have the primary responsibility for
                 the formulation of governmental policy and its
                 transmission into law though the condition
                 precedent to the exercise of this responsibility
                 is its retaining the confidence of the legislative
                 branch of the State. The Governor occupies the
                 position of the head of the executive in the State
                 but it is virtually the Council of Ministers in
                 each State that carries on the executive
                 Government. In the Indian Constitution,
                 therefore, we have the same system of
                 parliamentary executive as in England and the
                 Council of Ministers consisting, as it does, of
                 the members of the legislature is, like the
                 British Cabinet, “a hyphen which joins, a
                 buckle which fastens the legislative part of the
                 State to the executive part
However, as held by this Court in numerous
                 decisions, this Court has the power of judicial
                 review of orders of the Governor under
Article
                 161
, which can be impugned on certain grounds.
Non-exercise of the power under
Article 161
is
                 not immune from judicial review, as held by this
                 Court in
Epuru Sudhakar v. State of A.P. Given
petitions under
Article 161
pertain to the liberty
                 of individuals, inexplicable delay not on account
                 of the prisoners is inexcusable as it contributes
                 to adverse physical conditions and mental
                 distress faced by a prisoner, especially when the
                 State Cabinet has taken a decision to release the
                 prisoner by granting him the benefit of
                 remission/commutation of his sentence.”

                                   (Emphasis supplied)

(iv)    Lastly, as regards the contention of the respondents that the decision

        of the Governor to forward the mercy petition to the President was

        done in exercise of his discretion owing to the irrational

        recommendation of the Cabinet in line with the ratio of M.P. Special

        Police (supra), this Court held that the aforesaid decision would not

        be applicable, since there is nothing to make out a case of irrational

        or non-consideration of relevant factors by the State government to

        warrant the Governor exercising his discretion and deviating from

        their recommendations as laid down in M.P. Special Police (supra).

        The relevant observations read as under:
238. For the exercise of judicial review, the existence of a certain set of definitive

     standards against which the courts can embark upon their scrutiny, is

     quintessential. Without these standards, the power of judicial review could

     be said to be ineffective in certain contexts which shall be elucidated upon

     in the latter parts of the judgment. The doctrine of stare-decisis is not just

     concerned with ensuring that decisions of higher courts or of larger benches
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 204 of 414
are duly adhered to and questions of law already settled and put to quietus

    by higher judicial authorities are not disturbed. The idea is also to infuse a

    sense of judicial comity within the intertwined hierarchical courts in the

    manner of their functioning. Additionally, one of the core precepts of stare-

    decisis is that not only the decisions but the very decision-making process

    of the courts are predicated upon a discernible standard, often coined as

    ‘judicially manageable standards’. We shall discuss this in more detail in the

    later parts of this judgment.





245. The prescription of a time-limit is with a view to ensure that the Governor

     is not conferred with the power of exercising a pocket veto under the scheme

     of
Article 200
, and hinder the law-making process in the State without the

     existence of any reasonable grounds. While the decision in
Nambudiri
(supra) does not make the prescription of such a time-limit by the Court

     impermissible, the decisions, adverted to above, vest this Court with

     sufficient power to ensure that the procedure prescribed under
Article 200
is

     followed by the Governor in a constitutionally permissible manner and in

     line with the principles of parliamentary democracy keeping in mind the

     nature of the power.        Such an approach also ensures that the State

     governments are not left remediless in cases of malicious, arbitrary or

     capricious exercise of power by the Governor under
Article 200.

247. This Court in
State of Punjab
(supra) held that the Constitution terms any

    inaction on part of the Governor as deplorable and that he cannot indefinitely

    keep the bills passed by the State legislature on a chokehold. The relevant

    observations read as under:
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 209 of 414
248. It is not unusual for this Court to prescribe time-limits for the discharge of

     certain functions, even in cases where no specific time-limit has been

     prescribed. Recently, in Periyammal (Dead) thr. LRs & Ors. v. Rajamani

     & Anr. Etc. reported in 2025 INSC 329, a two-Judge Bench of this Court,

     of which one of us (J.B. Pardiwala, J.) was a part, directed all the High

     Courts to issue directions to all the District Courts to decide pending

     execution petitions within a period of six-months without fail. The directions

     read as follows:

250. Keeping in mind the constitutional significance of
Article 200
and the role

     it plays in the federal polity of the country, the following timelines are being

     prescribed. Failure to comply with these timelines would make the inaction

     of the Governors subject to judicial review by the courts:
In case of presentation of bill after reconsideration in accordance

              with the first proviso, the Governor must grant assent forthwith,

              subject to a maximum period of one-month.

255. This argument was also endorsed by Dr. Singhvi, who added that the

    observations made in
B.K. Pavitra
(supra) as regards the discretion of the

    Governor under
Article 200
of the Constitution have to be understood in the

    context of the reservation taking place on the aid and advice of the Council

    of Ministers.


258. An answer to the aforesaid question cannot be arrived at without first

    answering the following sub-questions:
260. The GoI Act, 1935, ushered in the era of provincial autonomy and formally

     required the Governor to act on the advice of the Ministers who were

     accountable to the provincial legislature by abolishing the system of dyarchy

     at the provincial level, while introducing it at the central level. However, the

     Act also conferred upon the Governor certain special responsibilities, such

     as maintaining peace and tranquility within the province and safeguarding

     minority interests. These responsibilities necessitated the exercise of

     discretion by the Governor in specific matters. Further, the autonomy of the

     Governor in such cases remained subject to the general superintendence and
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 216 of 414
control of the Governor-General, ensuring oversight over the exercise of his

     individual judgment.

275. However, Shri. T. T. Krishnamachari pointed out that there existed specific

        provisions under the Draft Constitution wherein the Governor was in fact

        empowered to act in his discretion, irrespective of the advice tendered by his
20
8, CONSTITUENT ASSEMB. DEB., (Jun. 1, 1949) 489.
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 228 of 414
Council of Ministers. Therefore, according to him, there were two ways of

        drafting which would capture the aforesaid underlying idea: One, would be

        to make a mention of this exception under draft
Article 143
itself and

        enumerate the specific scenarios where the Governor would be able to

        exercise his discretion in the subsequent relevant articles or; Two, would be

        to leave out any mention of this discretionary power under draft
Article 143
and only state it in the appropriate article that will follow. In the case of draft
Article 143
, according to him, it was only that the former method had been

        followed. Therefore, the general proposition or the default rule would be that

        “the Governor has normally to act on the advice of his Ministers except in

        so far as the exercise of his discretions covered by those Articles in the

        Constitution in which he is specifically empowered to act in his

        discretion.”21

280. Shri. Alladi Krishnaswami Ayyar echoed the stance taken by Shri T.T.

    Krishnamachari. He stated that, in the first place, a general principle under
Article 143
is laid down, namely, the principle of ministerial responsibility

    that the Governor in the various spheres of executive activity should

    normally act on the advice of his ministers. Then, the Article goes on to

    carve out an exception as regards the matters under which the Governor is

    required to exercise certain functions under his own discretion. Therefore, it

    was his conclusion that as long as there are articles under the Constitution

    which enable the Governor to act in his discretion, the draft
Article 143
as it

    was framed was perfectly in order. In certain circumstances, this exercise of

    discretion may be to override the Cabinet or to refer to the President. If later

    on, the Constituent Assembly were to arrive at the conclusion that those

    subsequent Articles which enable the Governor to act in his discretion in

    specific cases must be deleted, it would be open to revise draft
Article 143.
But as long as there are Articles occurring later in the Constitution which

    permit the Governor to act in his discretion and not on ministerial

    responsibility, the present draft
Article 143
was drafted rightly.
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 232 of 414
281. The only other question, in his opinion, was to see whether the Constituent

        Assembly had to first make a provision under draft
Article 143
that the

        Governor shall mandatorily act on ministerial responsibility and then go on

        to provide “Notwithstanding anything contained in
Article 143
, [...] he can

        do this” or that “Notwithstanding anything contained in
Article 143
, he can

        act in his discretion” in the subsequent relevant Articles. However, he

        favored the method of drafting that had already been adopted i.e., to provide

        in draft
Article 143
itself that the Governor shall always act on ministerial

        responsibility excepting in particular or specific cases where he is

        empowered to act in his discretion. If, of course, the Constituent Assembly

        came to the conclusion that in no case the Governor shall act in his

        discretion, and that he shall in every case act only on ministerial

        responsibility, then there will be a consequential change to this Article.

287. Dr. B. R. Ambedkar was open and quite willing to concede to the position

    of those members who were of the view that the last portion of clause (1) of
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 237 of 414
draft
Article 143
must be amended to mention the specific Articles under

    which the Governor shall exercise discretion, if at that stage of the

    Constituent Assembly debates the provisions intended for such vesting were

    already determined. The difficulty was that the Constituent Assembly had

    not yet arrived at a stage where they could discuss draft
Articles 175
or 188,

    nor had they exhausted all the possibilities of other provisions being made

    which vested the Governor with discretionary power. If all those

    possibilities were already known, draft
Article 143
could have been

    amended and those specific Articles could have been mentioned or listed

    out. Therefore, Dr. B. R. Ambedkar was firmly of the view that no wrong

    could be done if the words as they stood in the draft Article were retained.

289. What flows from a study of the Constituent Assembly debates concerning

    the appointment of the Governor and the scope of his discretionary powers

    is that the Governor plays a very crucial role in the political structure of the

    country. He is the bridge between the governments at the Central and State

    level, the proverbial buckle which ties the States with the Centre. The

    Punchhi Commission Report also acknowledged this dual role of the

    Governor – one as the custodian of the Constitution in the States and a

    representative of the Union, and the other as the constitutional head of the

    State and a “friend, philosopher and guide” of the State government as well

    as the people. The position of the Governor and how it differs from that of

    the President were discussed by Dr. B. R. Ambedkar as we have elaborated

    in the preceding paragraphs. This difference was also taken note of by

    Krishna Iyer J., in his opinion in
Samsher Singh
(supra) as we will discuss

    subsequently. We are of the firm view that this unique position of the

    Governor must be kept in mind whenever we set out to interpret any

    provision of the Constitution pertaining to any gubernatorial powers or
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 239 of 414
functions. It is not terminologies like “federal”, “quasi-federal” or “unitary”

     which should guide our interpretation of the Constitution. In turn, the words

     and ideas of the wise artisans, who carefully weaved the fabric of the

     Constitution with threads borrowed from across the world after dying them

     in colors uniquely Indian, that we should look towards, when in doubt about

     the fundamental ideas of our Constitution. The framers of the Constitution

     were cognizant of the fact that vesting the Centre with excessive powers

     would not be healthy for the country’s polity. In this regard we may refer to

     the observations made by the Sarkaria Commission – “there is considerable

     truth in the saying that undue centralization leads to blood pressure at the

     Centre and anemia at the periphery. The inevitable result is morbidity, and

     inefficiency. Indeed, centralization does not solve but aggravates the

     problems of the people.” Therefore, the curtailing of the powers of the

     Governor under the Constitution as distinguished from the GoI Act, 1935

     was done keeping in mind that the Centre does not arrogate all powers to

     itself by utilizing the Governor as an intermediary of the Centre at the State.
290. Arijit Pasayat, J., in his dissenting opinion in the decision of this Court in
Rameshwar Prasad
(supra), observed thus on the role of the Governor:
291. A Constitution Bench of this Court in
B.P. Singhal v. Union of India
reported in (2010) 6 SCC 331 observed that the Governor is neither an

    employee of the Union nor the agent of the party in power. The relevant

    observations are extracted below:
292. The question of whether the Governor is bound to act on the aid and advice

    of the Council of Ministers in all circumstances fell for the consideration of

    this Court in
Samsher Singh
(supra). Speaking for the majority, A.N. Ray

    C.J., observed as follows:
55. In making a report under
Article 356
the Governor will
        be justified in exercising his discretion even against the aid
        and advice of his Council of Ministers. The reason is that the
        failure of the constitutional machinery may be because of the
        conduct of the Council of Ministers. This discretionary power
        is given to the Governor to enable him to report to the
        President who, however, must act on the advice of his
        Council of Ministers in all matters. In this context
Article
        163(2)
is explicable that the decision of the Governor in his
        discretion shall be final and the validity shall not be called in
        question. The action taken by the President on such a report
        is a different matter. The President acts on the advice of his
        Council of Ministers. In all other matters where the Governor
        acts in his discretion he will act in harmony with his Council
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 245 of 414
of Ministers. The Constitution does not aim at providing a
            parallel administration within the State by allowing the
            Governor to go against the advice of the Council of Ministers.
56. Similarly,
Article 200
indicates another instance where
            the Governor may act irrespective of any advice from the
            Council of Ministers. In such matters where the Governor is
            to exercise his discretion, he must discharge his duties to the
            best of his judgment. The Governor is required to pursue such
            courses which are not detrimental to the State.”

                                             (Emphasis supplied)
293. A reading of the observations reproduced above indicates that the Court

    identified that the Governor was required to act on his discretion when

    performing his functions, inter alia, under
Articles 356
and
200
of the

    Constitution respectively. However, it is pertinent to note that under
Article

    200
, only the reservation of bills falling under the second proviso was

    observed by the Court to be an exercise which must be undertaken by the

    Governor independent of the advice of the Council of Ministers.
294. Furthermore, this Court laid down a general rule that the Governor, in the

    Cabinet form of government envisaged by the Constitution, acts as a

    constitutional head performing all his functions and exercising all his powers

    on the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers, except in a limited area.

    This limited area of discretion, too, is provided by the Constitution under the

    specific provisions wherein such exercise of discretion is permissible. The
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 246 of 414
Court gave certain illustrative examples where the expression “acts in his

     discretion” was used and observed that such provisions indicated that a

     special responsibility on the Governor has been entrusted upon by the

     Constitution.

295. It is pertinent to observe the observations made by the Court in paragraphs

     54, 55 and 56 of
Samsher Singh
(supra) which are reproduced above. In

     paragraph 54, while giving illustrations of the provisions where the

     Governor is expressly required by the Constitution to act in his discretion,

     the Court made reference to
Articles 356
and
200
respectively. In the context

     of
Article 200
, the Court observed that the limited area where express

     discretion has been conferred upon the Governor falls under the second

     proviso. Thereafter, in paragraph 55, the Court elaborated upon the exercise

     of discretion by the Governor under
Article 356.
In paragraph 56, the Court

     elaborated upon the exercise of discretion under
Article 200
and observed

     that
Article 200
“indicates another instance where the Governor may act

     irrespective of any advice from the Council of Ministers”. It is important to

     read the observations made in paragraph 56 along with paragraph 54 of the

     judgment. A conjoint reading of these two paragraphs, it becomes clear,

     without a cavil of doubt, that the second proviso to
Article 200
is an instance

     under the Constitution where the Governor has been conferred with the

     power to act in his discretion and even against the advice of the Council of
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 247 of 414
Ministers. However, the logical sequitur to this is that under
Article 200
,

     there is no scope for the Governor acting in his discretion other than the

     second proviso.

296. Speaking for himself and P.N. Bhagwati J., the redoubtable Krishna Iyer J.,

     in
Samsher Singh
(supra) observed as follows:
xxx           xxx          xxx
He further observed that the discretionary powers of the Governor existed

    only where they were expressly spelt out in the Constitution, and even the

    exercise of such discretion was remote-controlled by the Union Ministry.
298. Referring to the decision in
Samsher Singh
(supra), Krishna Iyer J., in
Maru Ram v. Union of India
reported in (1981) 1 SCC 107, again,

    reiterated the position of the President and the Governor as figureheads in

    the constitutional scheme. However, he observed that they acted in

    accordance with the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers “save in a

    narrow area of power” and that the “Governor vis-à-vis his Cabinet is no

    higher than the President save in a narrow area which does not include

    Article 161”, thereby implying that there is a small area of discretion

    available with the Governor, which however does not include
Article 161.
The relevant observations are reproduced hereinbelow:
299. A Constitution Bench of this Court while dealing with the issue of

    discretionary powers of the Governor in M.P. Special Police (supra) and

    explaining the import of
Article 163(2)
of the Constitution, observed that

    even if discretion was not expressly granted upon the Governor by a specific

    provision of the Constitution, it was open to him to act in his discretion in

    certain exceptional situations where by reason of threat to democratic
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 252 of 414
principles, he could not act on the advice of the Council of Ministers. The

relevant observations are reproduced hereinbelow:
A(1)(b), 371-A(2)(b), 371-A(2)(f) and paras 9(2) and 18(3) of
        the Sixth Schedule are some of the provisions. However,
        merely because the Constitution of India expressly provides,
        in some cases, for the Governor to act in his discretion, can
        it be inferred that the Governor can so act only where the
        Constitution expressly so provides? If that were so then sub-
        clause (2) of
Article 163
would be redundant. A question
        whether a matter is or is not a matter in which the Governor
        is required to act in his discretion can only arise in cases
        where the Constitution has not expressly provided that the
        Governor can act in his discretion. Such a question cannot
        arise in respect of a matter where the Constitution expressly
        provides that the Governor is to act in his discretion.
Article
        163(2)
, therefore, postulates that there can be matters where
        the Governor can act in his discretion even though the
        Constitution has not expressly so provided.
12. […] Thus, as rightly pointed out by Mr Sorabjee, a seven-
        Judge Bench of this Court has already held that the normal
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 253 of 414
rule is that the Governor acts on the aid and advice of the
        Council of Ministers and not independently or contrary to it.
        But there are exceptions under which the Governor can act
        in his own discretion. Some of the exceptions are as set out
        hereinabove. It is, however, clarified that the exceptions
        mentioned in the judgment are not exhaustive. It is also
        recognised that the concept of the Governor acting in his
        discretion or exercising independent judgment is not alien to
        the Constitution. It is recognised that there may be situations
        where by reason of peril to democracy or democratic
        principles, an action may be compelled which from its nature
        is not amenable to Ministerial advice. Such a situation may
        be where bias is inherent and/or manifest in the advice of the
        Council of Ministers.
xxx          xxx           xxx
19.
Article 163
has been extracted above. Undoubtedly, in a
        matter of grant of sanction to prosecute, the Governor is
        normally required to act on aid and advice of the Council of
        Ministers and not in his discretion. However, an exception
        may arise whilst considering grant of sanction to prosecute a
        Chief Minister or a Minister where as a matter of propriety
        the Governor may have to act in his own discretion. Similar
        would be the situation if the Council of Ministers disables
        itself or disentitles itself.
xxx          xxx           xxx
300. The decision in this case was a step forward from the general rule laid down

     by the larger Bench in
Samsher Singh
(supra). However, what is essential

     to note is that the Court did not dilute the general rule laid down earlier, and

     only allowed for a very limited scope of discretion for the Governor in

     certain exceptional situations in light of
Article 163(2).
The extraordinary

     nature of the exceptional situations envisaged by the Court can be gauged

     from the use of the expressions “peril to democracy or democratic

     principles”, “bias is inherent and/or manifest in the advice of the Council of

     Ministers”, “Council of Ministers disables itself or disentitles itself” and

     “there would be a complete breakdown of the rule of law”. Whenever the

     situation arises for the Governor to exercise discretion in discharge of a

     function which is ordinarily to be exercised upon the aid and advice of the

     Council of Ministers, it is these exceptional circumstances that the Governor

     must take into account before rejecting the aid and advice tendered to him.
Courts too, when judicially reviewing the exercise of discretion by the

     Governor in such cases, must be guided by the situations as described in the

     decision in M.P. Special Police (supra).
Article 200
, being a provision

     where the Governor must act on ministerial advice as a general rule, the
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 255 of 414
aforesaid exposition would squarely apply to this provision as well, thereby

    severely curtailing any possibility of exercise of discretion by the Governor.
301. Another Constitution Bench of this Court in Nabam Rebia (supra) had the

    occasion to discuss at length the nature of the position of the Governor in

    the constitutional scheme, along with the source and scope of his

    discretionary powers. The Court held that the discretionary powers of the

    Governor could be traced back to
Article 163(1)
, that is, he could act in

    exercise of his discretionary powers only where expressly provided for

    under the Constitution, or where the interpretation of a constitutional

    provision could not be construed otherwise, or in cases where this Court has

    declared the exercise of powers to be done by the Governor in his discretion

    notwithstanding ministerial advice. Further, the Court held that the finality

    expressed under
Article 163(2)
was only in respect of those situations where

    the exercise of discretion by the Governor was permissible under the

    framework of
Article 163(1)
and any exercise of discretion beyond the

    jurisdiction provided by the Constitution would be subject to judicial review.

    The relevant observations are reproduced hereinbelow:
xxx          xxx           xxx
154. We are, therefore, of the considered view that insofar as
        the exercise of discretionary powers vested with the
        Governor is concerned, the same is limited to situations,
        wherein a constitutional provision expressly so provides that
        the Governor should act in his own discretion. Additionally,
        a Governor can exercise his functions in his own discretion,
        in situations where an interpretation of the constitutional
        provision concerned, could not be construed otherwise. We,
        therefore, hereby reject the contention advanced on behalf of
        the respondents, that the Governor has the freedom to
        determine when and in which situation, he should take a
        decision in his own discretion, without the aid and advice of
        the Chief Minister and his Council of Ministers. We
        accordingly, also turn down the contention, that whenever
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 259 of 414
the Governor in the discharge of his functions, takes a
        decision in his own discretion, the same would be final and
        binding, and beyond the purview of judicial review. We are
        of the view that finality expressed in
Article 163(2)
would
        apply to functions exercised by the Governor in his own
        discretion, as are permissible within the framework of
Article
        163(1)
, and additionally, in situations where the clear intent
        underlying a constitutional provision, so requires i.e. where
        the exercise of such power on the aid and advice, would run
        contrary to the constitutional scheme, or would be
        contradictory in terms.
304. This Court in
B.K. Pavitra
(supra) took the view that the Constitution has

    entrusted the Governor with the discretion of reserving a bill, presented to

    him for assent, for the consideration of the President. It also held that the
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 267 of 414
exercise of the power of reservation of bills for the consideration of the

    President could be done by the Governor contrary to the aid and advice

    tendered by the Council of Ministers. The Court observed that such an

    important responsibility having been conferred upon a constitutional

    functionary, its discharge was expected to be undertaken upon careful

    reflection and with statesmanship, and in a manner that does not thwart

    democratic federalism. On the nature of bills which may be reserved for the

    consideration of the President, the Court held that it was impossible to lay

    down with certainty all the situations wherein such a reference may be

    warranted.

305. We find ourselves in disagreement with the view taken in
B.K. Pavitra
(supra) that the Constitution confers a discretion upon the Governor insofar

    as the reservation of bills for the consideration of the President is concerned.

    We say so because the removal of the expression “in his discretion” from

    Section 75 of the GoI Act, 1935 when it was being adapted as
Article 200
of the Constitution, clearly indicates that any discretion which was available

    to the Governor under the GoI Act, 1935 in respect of reservation of bills

    became unavailable with the commencement of the Constitution. The views

    expressed by the members of the Constituent Assembly, which are recorded

    in the debates that took place on
Article 175
of the Draft Constitution, also
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 268 of 414
indicate the same29. We are also of the view that the same is also in alignment

     with the fundamental tenets of responsible government in a parliamentary

     democracy. The only exception to the general principle of the Governor

     adhering to the aid and advice tendered by the Council of Ministers can be

     traced to
Article 163(1)
and the second proviso to
Article 200.
306. Pertinently, the Court in
B.K. Pavitra
(supra) failed to take into

     consideration the larger Bench decisions in
Samsher Singh
(supra) and

     M.P. Special Police (supra).
As we have discussed above, paragraphs 54 to

     56 of the decision in
Samsher Singh
(supra) make it clear beyond any doubt

     that there is no express requirement under the Constitution for the exercise

     of discretion by the Governor in discharge of his functions under
Article

     200
, except to the limited extent of the second proviso where the expression

     “in his opinion” is employed for the Governor. This is also apparent from

     the conscious decision of the Constituent Assembly in removing the

     expression “in his discretion” while enacting
Article 200.
Thus, the only

     express stipulation where the Governor may exercise discretion for

     reservation of bills is in the second proviso to
Article 200.
Even when looked

     at from the perspective of necessary implication, the discretion of the

     Governor in reserving the bills for the consideration of the President can be
29
9, CONSTITUENT ASSEMB. DEB. (Aug 1, 1949) 59-62; 10, CONSTITUENT ASSEMB. DEB. (Oct. 17,
1949) 392-394.

311.
B.K. Pavitra
(supra) made a reference to paragraph 375 of the decision in

    Nabam Rebia (supra) to support the idea that the Governor is entrusted with

    discretion in the exercise of his powers under
Article 200.
However, it is

    pertinent to note that in the said paragraph, the Court observed that “The

    Governor is expected to function in accordance with the provisions of the

    Constitution (and the history behind the enactment of its provisions)”. The

    history behind the enactment of
Article 200
is loud and clear and speaks for
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 273 of 414
itself as regards the intention of the framers of the Constitution, as we have

    discussed in detail.

W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 274 of 414
313. Reference must also be made at this point to the observation made by this

    Court in
Valluri Basavaiah Chowdhari
(supra) wherein it was observed

    thus:
314. As discussed earlier, D.D. Basu has also taken a similar view in his

        commentary on the Constitution of India30. The position prevailing in a

        number of international jurisdictions as discussed in the preceding parts of

        this judgment, also lends credence to this view.

315. The deletion of the expression “in his discretion” both from the substantive

        part of
Article 200
as well as from the first proviso to it signifies that the

        intention of the framers of the Constitution was to ensure that the ordinary

        exercise of the Governor’s function under
Article 200
was to be in

        accordance with the aid and advice tendered to him by the Council of

        Ministers. The view expressed by Shri. Brajeshwar Prasad that the Governor

        should be conferred with some veto to negate an unsound legislation was

        expressly rejected by the Constituent Assembly. Further, it was explained

        by Mr. T.T. Krishnamachari that the first proviso was in the form of a saving

        clause where the Council of Ministers could ask the Governor to hold up a

        bill in which certain errors were discovered subsequent to its passage in the

        House(s), or to suitably respond to the popular sentiment expressed after

        such passage. Pertinently, during the course of the debates, it was observed

W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                         Page 276 of 414
by Dr. B. R. Ambedkar that in a responsible form of government, there can

     be no room for the Governor to act in his discretion.


W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 278 of 414
319. Exception (a) as mentioned above is one which is expressly provided by the

    Constitution to fall within the ambit of discretionary powers of the

    Governor. Exception (b) flows from a reading of those provisions which

    require the mandatory assent of the President to a bill passed by the State

    legislature and thus are to be construed in light of the observations made in

    Nabam Rebia (supra) as instances “where such intent emerges from a
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 279 of 414
legitimate interpretation of the provision concerned, and the same cannot

     be construed otherwise.” Exception (c) has to be construed and understood

     in the context of the observations made by this Court in M.P. Special Police

     (supra) as covering such “situations where by reason of peril to democracy

     or democratic principles, an action may be compelled which from its nature

     is not amenable to Ministerial advice.”



v.    Whether the exercise of discretion by the Governor in discharge of his
      functions under
Article 200
of the Constitution could be said to be
      subject to judicial review? If yes, what are the parameters for such
      judicial review?

323. Refuting the contention of the petitioner, the Attorney General for India

     placed reliance on the decisions of this Court in
Hoechst
(supra), Kaiser-I-

     Hind (supra), and
B.K. Pavitra
(supra) to argue that the grant of assent

     under
Articles 200
and
201
respectively has been previously held to be non-

     justiciable by this Court.
(iii) Thirdly, if the aforesaid discharge of functions is subject to judicial

           review, whether such discharge of functions could be said to be non-

           justiciable in light of the decisions of this Court in
Hoechst
(supra),

           Kaiser-I-Hind (supra), and
B.K. Pavitra
(supra)?
325.
Samsher Singh
(supra) in paragraph 54 observed that “The discretion

    conferred upon the Governor means that as the constitutional or formal

    head of the State the power is vested in him”. We have also discussed in

    detail, in the preceding sections, that the source of all discretion for the

    Governor is to be found within
Article 163(1)
of the Constitution alone.

    Thus, what falls for us to decide is whether the exercise of this constitutional

    power by the Governor could be said to be amenable to judicial review

    where such exercise is assailed on the ground that it transgresses the

    boundaries set by the Constitution. This Court has had the occasion of

    discussing the concept of judicial review in a catena of cases. We are of the

    view that for a better exposition and enlightenment on this issue, it would be

    prudent and beneficial to make a reference to all these decisions.
326.
In
Maru Ram
(supra) this Court speaking eruditely through the inimitable

    Krishna Iyer, J., observed that all public power including constitutional

    powers of pardon, commutation and release under
Articles 72
and
161
of the

    Constitution respectively, cannot run riot or be exercisable irrationally or

    arbitrarily. Any action under these provisions must be informed by the finer

    canons of constitutionalism. In his words, “the rule of law, under our

    constitutional order, transforms all public power into responsible,

    responsive, regulated exercise informed by high purposes and geared to
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 284 of 414
people’s welfare”. It held that all the powers entrusted by the Constitution

must, in its exercise, eschew any form of arbitrariness and stem from an

intelligible and well-reasoned criterion that is predicated on an earnest

purpose. It further categorically held that – “while constitutional power is

beyond challenge, its actual exercise may still be vulnerable” – to judicial

review. In the last, Krishna Iyer, J., further cautioned that such power ought

not to be vulgarized or abused by personal vanity and the notions of those

exercising such powers. The relevant observations read as under:
327. This Court, speaking through nine-Judges in
Indra Sawhney v. Union of

    India
reported in (1992) Supp (3) SCC 217 held that the yardstick of

    subjecting an act or a decision to judicial review is not whether it is a

    legislative act or an executive decision on a policy matter but whether it

    violates any constitutional guarantee or the rights under Part III of the

    Constitution. The
Court further held
that the doctrine of political thicket does

    not apply in the Indian constitutional framework. It is not that the courts

    avoid entering into a political question because of the doctrine of separation

    of power, but because of desirability of avoiding entering into a political

    question. The relevant observations are reproduced hereinbelow:
328. Further, this Court in
B.P. Singhal
(supra) upon examining a catena of

    decisions on the scope and evolution of the power of judicial review of the

    courts observed that, although under the English Law, the prerogative

    powers of the monarch such as the power to make treaties, grant mercy or

    to dissolve the parliament etc. are traditionally not subject to judicial review

    due to the very nature of such powers falling outside the expertise and

    competence of the courts, yet such preclusion of the power of judicial review

    is by no means a blanket rule. It observed that even prerogative powers,

    insofar as the questions of legality, rationality or procedural propriety are

    concerned, would always be amenable to judicial review, because the

    safeguarding of such considerations in the exercise of any prerogative

    powers is the domain, responsibility and duty of the courts as the sentinel on

    the qui vive.
Placing reliance on the decision of this Court in
State of

    Rajasthan v. Union of India
reported in (1977) 3 SCC 592 it held that the
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 288 of 414
courts, as the protector and ultimate interpreter of the Constitution, not only

have the power but an obligation to determine the power conferred on each

branch of the government, the extent and limits of such powers and whether

the exercise of such power exceeds those limits or not, irrespective of

whether such powers are the exclusive prerogative of any one branch of the

government or such questions are inherently political in complexion. The

relevant observations read as under:
329.
Furthermore, B.P. Singhal
(supra) categorically held that unlike England,

    all powers that have been conferred upon the President and the Governor by

    the Constitution are not a matter of prerogative but a constitutional
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 291 of 414
responsibility and its exercise, a matter of performance of an official duty of

the highest sanctity, and thus, unquestionably amenable to judicial review.

It observed that the sufficiency of the attending facts and circumstances

necessitating the exercise of such powers is to be decided by the President

or the Governor. However, the question of whether such exercise is

predicated upon all relevant cogent materials and falls within the limitations

of the constitutional scheme and is not a result of an arbitrary or malafide

exercise, would be subject to the judicial review of the courts.
Placing

reliance on
Maru Ram
(supra) it held that the exercise of such powers by

the President only carries with it a notional presumption of a careful and

proper exercise based on objective considerations, but, by no stretch of

imagination can it be construed to confer an immunity from judicial review.

It further explained, in the context of
Article 72
of the Constitution, the

standard of judicial review that the courts are expected to apply when

scrutinizing the exercise of such power by the President. It held that where

reasons have been given for the exercise of such power, there the courts may

interfere only if the reasons are based on irrelevant or extraneous

considerations. However, where no reasons have been given, there the courts

may interfere only if the exercise is vitiated by a flawed understanding of

the ambit of such power by misjudgment or is otherwise arbitrary,

discriminatory or malafide. The relevant observations read as under: -
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 292 of 414
330.
In
Keisham
(supra), this Court had held that a Speaker acting under the

    Tenth Schedule of the Constitution would be duty bound to decide the
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 293 of 414
disqualification petitions made before him within a reasonable time and that

    any failure in exercising this jurisdiction conferred upon him or reluctancy

    in acting in a time-bound manner would be a fit ground for the courts to

    engage in an exercise of judicial review of his actions, irrespective of the

    fact that it is the Speaker who has the prerogative to adjudicate such

    petitions. It held that even where the jurisdiction of the courts to embark

    upon an examination on the merits of such prerogative powers has been

    ousted, the same does not curtail or inhibit the power of judicial review over

    the manner of exercise or non-exercise of such prerogative powers.
331. Similarly, in A.G. Perarivalan (supra), this Court reiterated that any

    inexplicable or inexcusable non-exercise of a prerogative or sovereign

    power would be amenable to judicial review and that the manner of exercise

    of such powers by the Governor could not be said to be impervious to

    judicial scrutiny.
334. The High Court of Madras in
S. Ramakrishnan v. State of Tamil Nadu
reported in 2020 SCC OnLine Mad 5207 was in seisin of a similar issue

    involving a bill passed by the State Legislative Assembly which remained

    pending for two months before the Governor for grant of assent. When the

    High Court posed a question as regards the inaction on the part of the

    Governor, the Advocate General referred to
Article 361
of the Constitution.

    The Court interpreted
Article 361
in light of
Article 200
and observed that

    the protection granted to the Governor under the Constitution was to perform

    his constitutional duties expeditiously. It also underscored the obligation of

    the courts to perform their constitutional duties and subjecting

    unconstitutional actions to judicial scrutiny in public interest. The relevant

    observations are as follows:
335. Thus, what is discernible from above is that the discharge of functions by

     the President or the Governor as constitutional and formal heads is

     undoubtedly subject to judicial review by virtue of it being an exercise of

     their constitutional powers. However, could it at the same time be said that

     nevertheless it would be improper for the courts to examine such actions of

     the President or the Governor as the actions are essentially political in nature

     and hence non-justiciable for the reason that no judicial standard can be

     evolved for the scrutiny of such actions. In this regard, we may make

     reference to certain decisions rendered by this Court as well as few landmark

     decisions of other international jurisdictions.
336.
In
Minerva Mills v. Union of India
reported in (1980) 3 SCC 625, this Court

     held that the jurisdiction of courts is not ousted merely because a question

     has a political colour. Every constitutional question, irrespective of the

     political complexion or make thereof, falls within the jurisdiction of the

     courts. The Court held that whether the legislature or the executive has acted

     within the limits of its authority or not, is for the courts to decide. The

     relevant observations are as follows:
337. The nine-Judge Bench decision of this Court in
S.R. Bommai
(supra)

    observed that the concept of justiciability is not synonymous with judicial

    review. It noted that even while exercising the power of judicial review,

    courts can decline to exercise such power as being non-justiciable. It

    categorically observed that though judicial review may be avoided on

    questions of political nature, yet legal questions camouflaged with a political

    cloak will be justiciable. The relevant observations have been reproduced

    hereinbelow:
The courts must have judicially manageable standards to
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 299 of 414
decide a particular controversy. Justiciability on a subjective
            satisfaction conferred in the widest terms to the political
            coordinate executive branch created by the constitutional
            scheme itself is one of the considerations to be kept in view in
            exercising judicial review [...]”
                                              (Emphasis supplied)
338. This Court in
A.K. Kaul v. Union of India
reported in (1995) 4 SCC 73 also

    elucidated the distinction between judicial review and justiciability. It

    observed that, in a written Constitution, the bounds within which the various

    organs of the State are delineated, the same implicitly casts a duty upon the

    courts to test the validity of every action of such constitutional organ,

    through judicial review, to ensure that such exercise of power is within the

    confines of the Constitution. It thus, held that the power of judicial review

    of the courts would be available in respect of exercise of all powers by any

    authority under the Constitution unless expressly excluded. It further held

    that, although judicial review is the norm, yet the unavailability of judicially

    manageable standards in certain aspects of the power, whose exercise is in

    question, may render the judicial review of such exercise of power non-

    justiciable. It explained that justiciability refers to the question whether a

    particular field could be said to fall within the purview of the power of

    judicial review. The relevant observations are as follows:
339. This Court in
Epuru Sudhakar v. Govt. of A.P.
reported in (2006) 8 SCC

    161, speaking in the context of
Articles 72
and
161
of the Constitution

    respectively, observed that the determining factor in deciding whether a

    sovereign or prerogative power would be subject to judicial review is the

    subject-matter of such power and not its source. It held that the exercise of

    every prerogative power is subject to the rule of law and the rule of law
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 301 of 414
cannot be made subservient to political expediency. The Court defined that

‘manageable standards’ refer to certain discernible standards expected in a

functioning democracy. It also held that exercise of any prerogative power

cannot be placed in a straitjacket formula and manageable standards would

vary depending on the nature of the power. The relevant observations are as

follows:
However, when the impugned decision does not indicate any
            data or manageable standards, the decision amounts to
            derogation of an important constitutional principle of Rule of
            Law.”
                                             (Emphasis supplied)
340. In Regina (Miller) v. Prime Minister (Lord Advocate and others

    intervening) reported in [2019] 3 WLR 589, the Supreme Court of the

    United Kingdom was dealing with the justiciability of the power of

    prorogation. It was held that, although the courts cannot decide political

    questions, yet, the fact that a dispute arises from a matter of political

    controversy would not restrain the courts completely from looking into it, in

    exercise of judicial review. It further noted that almost all decisions by the

    executive have a political hue to them, yet, the courts in the past have
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 303 of 414
exercised a supervisory jurisdiction. The Court held that a threat to

    parliamentary sovereignty constitutes as a significant ground for

    justiciability of prerogative powers.
341. In the seminal decision of Baker v. Carr, reported in 1962 SCC OnLine US

    SC 40, the Supreme Court of the United States of America examined

    whether questions of legislative apportionment were essentially political

    questions and hence, not justiciable. The Court in this case laid down six

    heavily overlapping indicia of a non-justiciable matter. These were as

    follows: (i) a textually demonstrable constitutional commitment of the issue

    to another political branch; or (ii) a lack of judicially discoverable and

    manageable standards for resolving it, or (iii) a need to make an initial policy

    determination clearly for non-judicial discretion, or (iv) the impossibility of

    a decision by the court without expressing lack of respect due to co-ordinate

    branches of Government; or (v) an unusual need for unquestioning

    adherence to a political decision already made; or (vi) the potentiality for

    embarrassment from multifarious pronouncements by various departments

    on one question. It was emphatically held that, save the aforesaid

    considerations, no other issue is liable for dismissal on ground of a lack of

    justiciability.
342. Before proceeding further, we deem it appropriate to refer to all the aforesaid

     decisions of this Court where the justiciability of assent has been discussed.

     The first in line is the Constitution Bench decision in
Kameshwar Singh
(supra) where M.C. Mahajan, J., (as his lordship then was), in the context of
Article 31A
of the Constitution, observed that the assent of the President,

     once given to a bill reserved for his consideration, is non-justiciable. The

     relevant observations are as follows:
344. The next decision where the justiciability of assent was discussed is the

    decision of the three-Judge Bench in
Hoechst
(supra) wherein, inter alia,

    one of the grounds of challenge to the legislation under consideration was

    that since the subject matter of the bill fell under List II of the Seventh

    Schedule, there was no occasion for the Governor to have reserved the bill

    for the consideration of the President. It is on this ground that the subsequent

    grant of assent by the President was called into question. Negativing the

    contention, the Court observed thus:
345. It is important to note that the aforesaid observations were made by this

    Court in response to the argument that the grant of assent by the President,

    in a case where it was not necessary for the Governor to reserve the bill for

    the consideration of the President, would vitiate the assent given by the

    President. On the contrary, the case at hand involves a totally different

    factual situation wherein the State Government is aggrieved by the

    reservation of bills by the Governor in exercise of his discretion and not in

    accordance with the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers. The further

    grievance of the petitioner is that such reservation of bills by the Governor

    is not guided by constitutional principles but is impelled by lack of bonafides

    and political reasons. The applicability of the
ratio
laid down in
the aforesaid

    decisions of
Kameshwar Singh
(supra) and
Hoechst
(supra) and also the

    other decisions of this Court as regards the questions of justiciability and

    judicial review, would have to be decided keeping in mind the peculiar facts

    of the case at hand which we have been called upon to deal with.
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 307 of 414
346. The decision in
Hoechst
(supra) was referred to in the decision of this Court

     in
Bharat Sevashram Sangh v. State of Gujarat
reported in (1986) 4 SCC

     51 wherein one of the challenges to the validity of the legislation was that

     the bill had received conditional assent from the President, and such partial

     or conditional assent not being permissible under the Constitution, was thus

     erroneous in law.
While the Court referred to the observations made in
Hoechst
(supra), it also looked into the materials on record and arrived at a

     conclusion that there was no infirmity in the grant of assent by the President.

     Therefore, it cannot be said that the decision of the Court was based on the

     non-justiciability of assent alone as the Court arrived at the finding after the

     actual satisfaction on the validity of assent upon a perusal of the relevant

     materials. The relevant observations are reproduced below:
347.
Hoechst
(supra) was also referred to and relied upon by this Court in
B.K.

    Pavitra
(supra) wherein it was observed that owing to the sovereign nature

    of the power of the Governor to reserve a bill for the consideration of the

    President under
Article 200
, it would not be possible for this Court to reflect

    upon the situations in which such a power of reference may be exercised by

    the Governor.
It was further observed by the Court that the decision in
Hoechst
(supra) has excluded the exercise of this power from the scope of

    judicial scrutiny. The relevant observations read as under: -
justiciable.
Hoechst [Hoechst Pharmaceuticals Ltd. v. State
            of Bihar
, (1983) 4 SCC 45 : 1983 SCC (Tax) 248] also lays
            down that even if, as it turns out, it was not necessary for the
            Governor to reserve a Bill for the consideration of the
            President, yet if it was reserved for and received the assent of
            the President, the law as enacted cannot be regarded as
            unconstitutional for want of “proper” assent.
351. As regards justiciability, it was held by the Court that the examination of the

     records to ascertain the extent to which assent was sought for, would not

     amount to deciding whether assent was rightly or wrongly given. Thus, it

     could not be said that the Court was determining the validity of the assent

     granted by the President. The relevant observations made by M.B., Shah J.,,

     speaking for the majority, are reproduced below:
352. Doraiswamy Raju, J., in a concurring opinion, laid strong emphasis on the

    requirement that a reference to the President for the purpose of
Article

    254(2)
must be precise and specific as regards the extent of protection sought

    for the State legislation. He observed that keeping in mind the serious
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 315 of 414
implications of the grant of assent of the President to a repugnant State law,

the making of such reference to the President cannot be exercised in a routine

manner. He further observed that the non-justiciability of the assent of the

President would not preclude the constitutional courts from examining the

sufficiency and justifiability of the predominance sought for the State

legislation over the Central legislation. The relevant observations are

reproduced below:
74. The mere forwarding of a copy of the Bill may obviate, if
        at all, only the need to refer to each one of the provisions
        therein in detail in the requisition sent or the letter
        forwarding it, but not obliterate the necessity to point out
        specifically the particular Central law or provisions with
        reference to which, the predominance is claimed or
        purported to be claimed. The deliberate use of the word
        “consideration” in clause (2) of
Article 254
, in my view, not
        only connotes that there should be an active application of
        mind, but also postulates a deliberate and careful thought
        process before taking a decision to accord or not to accord
        the assent sought for. If the object of referring the State law
        for consideration is to have the repugnancy resolved by
        securing predominance to the State law, the President has to
        necessarily consider the nature and extent of repugnancy, the
        feasibility, practicalities and desirabilities involved therein,
        though may not be obliged to write a judgment in the same
        manner, the courts of law do, before arriving at a conclusion
        to grant or refuse to grant or even grant partially, if the
        repugnancy is with reference to more than one law in force
        made by Parliament. Protection cannot be claimed for the
        State law, when questioned before courts, taking cover under
        the assent, merely asserting that it was in general form,
        irrespective of the actual fact whether the State claimed for
        such protection against a specific law or the attention of the
        President was invited to at least an apprehended repugnancy
        vis-à-vis the particular Central law. In the teeth of
        innumerable Central laws enacted and in force on concurrent
        subjects enumerated in List III of the Seventh Schedule to the
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 318 of 414
Constitution, and the hoard of provisions contained therein,
        artificial assumptions based on some supposed knowledge of
        all those provisions and the presumed regularity of official
        acts, cannot be blown out of proportion, to do away with an
        essential exercise, to make the “assent” meaningful, as if they
        are empty formalities, except at the risk of rendering
Article
        254
itself a dead letter or merely otiose. The significant and
        serious alteration in or modification of the rights of parties,
        both individuals or institutions resulting from the “assent”
        cannot be overlooked or lightly brushed aside as of no
        significance, whatsoever. In a federal structure, peculiar to
        the one adopted by our Constitution it would become
        necessary for the President to be apprised of the reason as to
        why and for what special reason or object and purpose,
        predominance for the State law over the Central law is
        sought, deviating from the law in force made by Parliament
        for the entire country, including that part of the State. When
        this Court observed in
Gram Panchayat of Village Jamalpur
        v. Malwinder Singh
[(1985) 3 SCC 661] that when the assent
        of the President is sought for a specific purpose the efficacy
        of the assent would be limited to that purpose and cannot be
        extended beyond it, and that if the assent is sought and given
        in general terms so as to be effective for all purposes different
        considerations may legitimately arise, it cannot legitimately
        be contended that this Court had also declared that
        reservation of the State law can also be by mere reference to
Article 254(2)
alone with no further disclosures to be made
        or that with mere forwarding of the Bill, no other information
        or detail was either a permissible or legalized and approved
        course to be adopted or that such course was held to be
        sufficient, by this Court, to serve the purpose of the said
        article. The expression “general terms” needs to be
        understood, in my view, a reference to a particular law as a
        whole in contrast to any one particular or individual in the
        said law and not that, it can be even without any reference
        whatsoever. The further observation therein, (SCC p. 669,
        para 12)
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 319 of 414
“not only was the President not apprised in the
             instant case that his assent was sought because of
             the repugnancy between the State Act and the pre-
75. This Court has, no doubt, held that the assent accorded
        by the President is not justiciable, and courts cannot spell out
        any infirmity in the decision arrived at, to give the assent.
        Similarly, when the President was found to have accorded
        assent and the same was duly published, it cannot be
        contended that the assent was not really that of the President,
        as claimed. It is also not given to anyone to challenge the
        decision of the President according assent, on merits and as
        to its legality, propriety or desirability. But that is not the
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 320 of 414
same thing as approving an attempt to draw a blanket or veil
        so as to preclude an examination by this Court or the High
        Court as to the justifiability and sufficiency or otherwise of
        the protection or predominance claimed for the State law
        over the law made by Parliament or the existing law, based
        upon the assent accorded, resulting at times in substantial
        alteration, change or modification in the rights and
        obligations of citizen, including the fundamental rights.
        When the Constitution extends a form of protection to a
        repugnant State law, permitting predominance and also to
        hold the field in the place of the law made by the Centre,
        conditioned upon the reservation of the State law for
        consideration of the President and obtaining his assent, it is
        to be necessarily viewed as an essential prerequisite to be
        effectively and meticulously fulfilled before ever availing of
        the protection and the same cannot be viewed merely as a
        ceremonial ritual. If such a vitally essential procedure and
        safeguard is to be merely viewed as a routine formality which
        can be observed in whatever manner desired by those
        concerned and that it would be merely enough, if the assent
        has been secured howsoever obtained, it would amount to
        belittling its very importance in the context of distribution of
        legislative powers and the absolute necessity to preserve the
        supremacy of Parliament to enact a law on a concurrent topic
        in List III, for the entire country. It would also amount to
        acceptance of even a farce of compliance to be actual or real
        compliance. Such a course could not be adopted by courts
        except by doing violence to the language, as well as the
        scheme, and the very object underlying
Article 254(2).
355. The reason why this Court in Kaiser-I-Hind (supra) insisted that the

    requirement of delineating the reasons necessitating the reservation of a bill

    by the Governor rests upon the State government is because it is the State

    through its Council of Ministers who are objectively better equipped in

    doing so, by virtue of the fact that the genesis of such bills is normally

    spearheaded by the Council of Ministers. Their close involvement in the

    deliberations that culminated into the bill, their crucial role as part of the

    members of the house of legislature and them being reposed with the

    responsibility of overall governance and well-being of the State, provides

    them the necessary expertise to assign robust reasons in making a reference.

    The State Council of Ministers being uniquely positioned to understand the

    legislative requirements of the State, the policy imperatives prevailing

    therein, and the socio-economic conditions demanding redressal, can better

    voice the reasons that ought to accompany such a reference which the

    Governor otherwise may not be capable of reasonably and comprehensively

    ascertaining if not for the aid and advice of the council of ministers.
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 325 of 414
356. It is in this background that we are of the view that the Governor would be

     duty bound to give careful deference to the aid and advice of the State

     Council of Ministers and only in the limited of exceptional circumstances

     may he deviate from such advice tendered to him, subject to the reference

     being in tune with the aforesaid principles enunciated in the preceding

     paragraphs.
359. The majority opinion of the Court in Kaiser-I-Hind (supra) held that the

     legislative procedure to be followed before the enactment of a legislation

     would always be amenable to judicial review and thus it would be open to

     the Courts to examine the reference which is made by the State government

     to the President seeking his assent. Applying the same logic, it could be said
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 327 of 414
that the reservation of bills by the Governor for the consideration of the

     President is also part of legislative procedure and thus the Courts would not

     be precluded from examining such reference to determine its legality and its

     constitutional veracity.
360. In the Canadian decision in Galati (supra) the grant of royal assent to a bill

     was held as non-justiciable on the ground of separation of powers, the grant

     of assent having been characterised as a legislative act. However, it must be

     kept in mind that the characterisation of the grant of assent as a legislative

     act was in the context of the well settled constitutional convention of a

     responsible government that assent must be granted in accordance with the

     advice of the Prime Minister. Further, as we have discussed in the preceding

     paragraphs, it is not the source of power, but the contents thereof which

     determine the scope of judicial review under the Constitution.
361. On the contrary, Anne Twomey writes that in cases where a Constitution is

     prescriptive, and a constitutional breach is involved, a court is more likely

     to hold the breach to be a justiciable issue, even if it relates to the grant of

     assent to a bill. She refers to the opinion of Millhouse, J. in Re

     Constitutional Reference No 1 of 2008 reported in [2009] 1 LRC 453,

     which held that where a country has a written Constitution, the courts always

     have the jurisdiction to remedy breaches of the Constitution. The said
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 328 of 414
decision was also accepted by the Court of Appeal of Vanuatu in Republic

    of Vanuatu v Carcasses reported in [2010] 2 LRC 264 which held that

    while a court will not otherwise inquire into or adjudicate upon issues arising

    in Parliament, it would be empowered to interpret and determine whether

    there has been a breach of a constitutional right.
b. Where the Governor reserves a bill for the consideration of the President

    and the President in turn withholds assent thereto then, it shall be open

    to the State Government to assail such an action before this Court. Such

    a challenge can broadly be made on the following grounds:
376. The special object fulfilled by
Article 201
and the important position it

    occupies in maintaining the quasi-federal structure of the country has been

    explained in detail by this Court in Kaiser-I-Hind (supra) as follows:
380. As regards the issue of delay under
Article 201
, as we have discussed in the

     preceding paragraphs, the Sarkaria Commission observed that the delay in

     the expeditious disposal of bills reserved for the consideration of the

     President was one of the major causes of strain in Centre-State relations. It

     also recommended that definite timelines must be adopted for facilitating

     the efficient disposal of references under
Article 201.
The timelines
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 348 of 414
suggested by the Commission are indicated in paragraph 120 of this

     judgment.
381. Besides prescribing timelines, the Commission also suggested that the

     reference being made by the Governor must be self-contained and contain

     all necessary information. We have discussed that the same was also

     observed by this Court in Kaiser-I-Hind (supra) in the context of references

     being made under
Article 254(2).
The reading of a timeline in
Article 201
was also suggested by the Punchhi Commission.
387. Another office memorandum was issued by the Ministry of Home Affairs to

    all the States/UTs on the same date in this regard and is reproduced below:
4. It has also been observed that many a time the Bill etc,
        contains drafting errors and State Governments, despite
        repeated persuasion, do not withdraw such Bills. Since a Bill
        containing errors cannot be presented to the President, State
        Governments are requested to kindly verify and check that a
        Bill is free from any drafting/typographical error. It is also
        observed that many a time the State Governments agree to
        make amendments as per the suggestions of Central
        Ministries/Departments, but still keeps on insisting for assent
        of the Bill in its original form. It is therefore requested that
        once the State Government tends to agree with the objections/
        views of the Central Departments/Ministries, the State
        Government may consider sending a consolidated proposal
        alongwith suggested amendments/modifications instead of
        insisting for assent of the Bill in their original form
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 356 of 414
388. The aforesaid memorandum then clarifies that when the appropriate

    Ministry at the Centre, which is concerned with the substantive issues,

    makes any objections, the same is then shared with the concerned State

    government for further seeking their views or clarifications on the matter.

    This is done with the object of apprising the concerned Central Ministry of

    the clarifications of the State government on the matter. A time-limit of one

    month has been prescribed for the same. As aspect of concern highlighted

    herein was the inaction or delayed action on part of the State government to

    furnish these relevant clarifications which further has the ripple effect of

    postponing the decision of the Centre on the matter. It was further prescribed

    that the State Governments must rectify any drafting or typographical errors

    pointed out by the Central Government and once the suggestions of the

    Central Government are accepted, the State governments should send a
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 357 of 414
consolidated proposal containing the amendments rather than insisting on

     the assent to bill in the original form.
393. This Court in
State of Punjab
(supra) had reached the conclusion that the

    option of withholding of assent under the substantive part of
Article 200
would be tethered to the first proviso thereto, predominantly because of the

    clear use of the expression “shall not withhold assent therefrom” therein. It

    is limpid that an identical expression remains absent in the proviso to Article
397. The natural corollary of the constitutional abhorrence to the notion of

    simpliciter withholding of assent within our Constitution is that a

    requirement and responsibility of assigning reasons to the withholding of

    assent is cast upon the President. What follows from this is that the reasons

    assigned by the President for withholding of assent must be communicated

    to the State government concerned. Such an inference is legitimate since

    there remains no logic in assigning reasons if the same cannot be responded

    to and addressed by the State government. Putting the State government to

    proper notice of the reconsiderations or amendments to the bill, which the

    Council of Ministers at the Centre may have, is also an essential obligation

    inhered in such situations. In the absence of such communication, there
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                     Page 362 of 414
exists a real and grave danger of denying the State government the

    knowledge of the reasons due to which the bill passed by the State legislature

    had not been assented to. Furthermore, there may exist situations where the

    State governments may be amenable to some remedial changes or

    amendments. However, in the absence of any communication, they may be

    robbed of any chance to undertake those changes and ensure that the bill

    becomes law in their State. The State governments must not be prevented

    from entertaining or possibly incorporating the changes or amendments to

    the bill which was originally referred to the President, solely due to the

    absence of a transparent information sharing mechanism, which the State

    government may be said to be entitled to in a federal polity. Entertaining

    such a dialogue assumes importance since the fulcrum of a healthy Centre-

    State relations, in a constitutional democracy, is the transparent

    collaboration and cooperation between the Union and the States.
406. In cases where the reservation is on the ground of repugnancy of the State

    legislation with a Central legislation, or under one of the provisions where

    the assent of President has been envisaged for the purpose of enforceability

    or imparting immunity to the legislation, it would be a matter where the

    President would decide the question of grant of assent keeping in mind the

    desirability of having a uniformity in the policy across the country on the

    subject matter involved. This, as was held in Kaiser-I-Hind (supra), is

    evident from the fact that the assent under
Article 201
is not the same as the

    assent to be granted under
Articles 111
and
201
, and the President has been

    given supremacy under the Constitution as regards the bills covered under
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 368 of 414
Article 201
by virtue of his constituent powers. In this regard, the

observations of the Sarkaria Commission may be referred to as guiding

principles by the President wherein it was observed thus:
5.10.06 We recommend that as a matter of convention, the
        President should not withhold assent only on the
        consideration of policy differences on matters relating, in
        pith and substance, to the State List, except on the grounds of
        patent unconstitutionality such as those indicated in para
        5.6.13 above.”
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 370 of 414
414. The object of
Article 143
in context of reference of bills, whose

    constitutionality is under consideration by the President under
Article 201
,

    has been explained by the N.L. Untwalia, J., In Re: The Special Courts Bill,

    1978 reported in (1979) 1 SCC 380. The relevant portion of his judgment is

    reproduced below:
416. The approach to be adopted by the courts in answering references under
Article 143
in respect of reserved bills also requires a perusal of

    constitutional provisions viz.
Articles 31A
, 31C
, 254
, 288
, 360
, etc. that

    place a requirement of assent to a bill by the President, either expressly or

    by necessary implication. The scope of these Articles is largely centred

    around social, economic and political objectives that are sought to be

    achieved by a State. The necessity for Presidential assent in case of

    legislations under these Articles is for enabling the Central government to
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                     Page 376 of 414
streamline policies and ensure uniformity in socio-economic and welfare

     measures across States. In contemplation of the bills under these Articles,

     the central government, more often than not, has policy considerations in

     mind and the reasons for assent or withholding thereof may not be on purely

     legal grounds.
418. The exercise of a self-imposed restraint by the court in matters involving

     purely political considerations is in consonance with the doctrine of political

     thicket, that is, the courts do not venture into areas of governance in which

     the Constitution gives a prerogative solely to the executive. For instance, the

     question whether a State legislation repugnant to a central law should be

     assented to by the President or not under
Article 254(2)
is largely a policy

     decision on part of the Union Government. In such matters, the court has its
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 377 of 414
hands tied and does not attempt to encroach into the functions of the

    executive wing.
419. However, in certain exceptional circumstances, the Governor may reserve a

    bill for consideration of the President on grounds that the bill is perilous to

    the principles of democracy and an interpretation of the Constitution is

    necessary to ascertain whether such legislation should be granted assent or

    not. In such cases where a bill has been reserved majorly on the grounds of

    not being in consonance with the constitutional principles and involves

    questions of constitutional validity, the executive is supposed to exercise

    restraint. It is expected that the Union executive should not assume the role

    of the courts in determining the vires of a bill and should, as a matter of

    practice, refer such question to the Supreme Court under
Article 143.
We

    have no qualms in stating that the hands of the executive are tied when

    engaging with purely legal issues in a bill and only the constitutional courts

    have the prerogative to study and provide recommendations as regards the

    constitutionality of a bill.
420. Since the constitutionality of a bill is a matter which falls within the

    exclusive domain of the courts, the opinion rendered by the Supreme Court

    under
Article 143
holds high persuasive value and should ordinarily be

    accepted by the legislature and the executive. We are no strangers to the

    arguments as regards the non-binding nature of the advisory jurisdiction of
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 378 of 414
this Court and that even though a bill may be referred to this Court by the

    President under
Article 143
, yet the opinion delivered thereunder may not

    be heeded to. However, merely because the jurisdiction under
Article 143
is

    not binding does not undermine the principles used by this Court to

    determine the constitutionality of the bill. This Court in Re Special Courts

    (supra) has held thus:
421. In our considered view, the only reason for which the legislative or the

    executive wing may not take note of the opinion delivered by the Supreme

    Court under
Article 143
is when the grounds on which a State bill was
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 379 of 414
reserved for the consideration of the President, are not purely legal but also

     involve certain policy considerations, which may outweigh the issue of

     constitutionality. In such cases, if the President acts contrary to the advice

     of this Court and withholds assent to a bill, he must record cogent reasons

     and materials that justify not granting assent.
425. Thus, as a matter of prudence, the States should enter into pre-legislation

       consultation with the Central government before introducing legislations on

       matters pertaining to those provisions of the Constitution where the assent

       of the President may be required. Likewise, the Central government, should

       consider the legislative proposals sent by the State governments with due

       regard and expediency. Such a practice reduces friction between Centre-

       State relations and also ensures that future roadblocks are overcome in the

       beginning itself, thereby promoting public welfare.
427. A three-Judge Bench of this Court in A.G. Perarivalan (supra) was dealing

       with the inaction on the part of the Governor of Tamil Nadu in deciding the

       remission petition of the petitioner therein. Despite the resolution passed by

       the State government in favour of granting remission to the petitioner, the

       Governor first kept the matter pending with him for a long duration and
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 382 of 414
thereafter, without taking a decision thereupon, referred the same to the

    President.
428. The Court, taking into consideration the huge delay caused by inaction on

    the part of the Governor, and also the adverse impact of such inaction on the

    liberty of the petitioner therein, exercised its powers under
Article 142
of

    the Constitution and deemed the petitioner to have served his sentence and

    ordered his release forthwith. The Court observed thus:
429. The Court, while summarizing its observations, further observed that the

    reference made by the Governor to the President had no constitutional

    backing and therefore the reference having been declared erronoeus, and the

    Council of Ministers having advised in the favour of remission, there was
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 383 of 414
no requirement to remand the matter to the Governor for taking a decision

     thereupon. The observations read thus:
434. In light of the aforesaid discussion, we answer the questions of law

     formulated by us as under:
(II)     The first proviso to
Article 200
should be read in conjunction with

              the option of withholding of assent provided in the substantive part

              of
Article 200.
It is not an independent course of action and has to

              be mandatorily initiated by the Governor in cases where the option
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 387 of 414
of withholding of assent is to be exercised. The decision of this

         Court in
State of Punjab
(supra) lays down the correct position of

         law in this regard.
(III)    The expression “the bill falls through unless the procedure under

         the first proviso is followed” as used in
Valluri Basavaiah

         Chowdhary
(supra) signifies that once the Governor declares

         withholding of assent and returns the bill to the House or Houses,

         the bill would lapse or fall through unless the House or Houses

         reconsider the bill in accordance with the suggestions made by the

         Governor in his message and present it to him after repassing. The

         expression “unless the procedure under the first proviso is

         followed” cannot be construed to mean that the Governor exercises

         discretion in setting the machinery prescribed under the first

         proviso in motion. Once the Governor exercises the option of

         withholding assent, he is under an obligation to follow the

         procedure prescribed in the first proviso “as soon as possible”.
(IV)     The decision of this Court in
State of Punjab
(supra) cannot be said

         to be per incuriam.
The observations made in the decision as

         regards attaching of the first proviso with the option of withholding

         of assent are supported by the observations made in
Valluri

         Basavaiah Chowdhary
(supra).
(VIII) In the facts of the present case, the reservation by the Governor of

         the ten Bills for the consideration of the President in the second

         round was illegal, erroneous in law and is thus liable to be set aside.
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 390 of 414
As a result, any subsequent action taken upon the said Bills by the

         President also does not survive and is thus set aside.


(IX)     The Bills, having been pending with the Governor for an unduly

         long period of time, and the Governor having acted with clear lack

         of bona fides in reserving the Bills for the consideration of the

         President, immediately after the pronouncement of the decision of

         this Court in
State of Punjab
(supra), are deemed to have been

         assented to by the Governor on the date when they were presented

         to him after being reconsidered.
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                         Page 391 of 414
(XII)    The settled position of law is that where no time-limit for the

         exercise of a power is prescribed, the same must be exercised in a

         reasonable time period. Guided by the decisions of this Court in

         A.G. Perarivalan (supra) and
Keisham
(supra), we find that it is

         no more res-integra that the courts are well-empowered to

         prescribe a time-limit for the discharge of any function or exercise

         of any power which, by its very nature, demands expediency.



(XIII) Prescription of a general time-limit by this Court, within which the

         ordinary exercise of power by the Governor under
Article 200
must

         take place, is not the same thing as amending the text of the

         Constitution to read in a time-limit which would fundamentally

         change the procedure and mechanism stipulated by
Article 200.
Prescription of such time-limits within the scheme of
Article 200
is

         with a view to lay down a determinable judicial standard for

         ascertaining the reasonable exercise of such power and to curtail

         any arbitrary inaction. This Court while prescribing a time-limit for

         the exercise of power, is guided by the inherent expedient nature of

         the procedure prescribed under
Article 200.
(XIV)    Keeping in mind the constitutional significance of
Article 200
and

         the role it plays in the federal polity of the country, the following
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 392 of 414
timelines are being prescribed. Failure to comply with these

         timelines would make the inaction of the Governors subject to

         judicial review by the courts:
(iii) In case of reservation of bills for the consideration of the

                President contrary to the advice of the State Council of

                Ministers, the Governor shall make such reservation within

                a maximum period of three months;
(XVI)    We declare the view taken in
B.K. Pavitra
(supra) to be per

         incuriam to the extent of the following two observations made

         therein – First, that the Constitution confers discretion upon the

         Governor insofar as the reservation of bills for the consideration of

         the President is concerned and; Secondly, that the exercise of

         discretion by the Governor under
Article 200
is beyond judicial

         scrutiny.
The decision of
B.K. Pavitra
(supra) is not in consonance

         with the observations made by the larger bench decision of this

         Court in
Samsher Singh
(supra).
The majority opinion in
Samsher

         Singh
(supra) in paragraph 28 observed that “Governor is the

         constitutional or formal head of the State and he exercises all his

         powers and functions conferred on him by or under the Constitution

         on the aid and advice of his Council of Ministers save in spheres

         where the Governor is required by or under the Constitution to

         exercise his functions in his discretion” At the cost of repetition,

         we again reiterate “and he exercises all his powers and functions

         conferred on him by or under the Constitution on the aid and

         advice of his Council of Ministers”.
The decision in
Samsher Singh
(supra) illustrated certain

         provisions of the Constitution which expressly required the

         Governor to exercise his powers in his discretion. The second

         proviso to
Article 200
was one such illustration.
Thus, it is amply

         clear from the dictum in
Samsher Singh
(supra) that the seven-

         Judge Bench, after taking into consideration the scheme of
Article
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                     Page 395 of 414
200
, observed that the second proviso to
Article 200
was the only

         instance where the Governor had been entrusted with the power to

         act in his own discretion.
Subsequent Constitution Bench decisions

         in M.P. Special Police (supra) and Nabam Rebia (supra) clarified

         that besides the instances where the Governor has been expressly

         conferred with discretionary powers, there may still be certain

         exceptional circumstances wherein it would be legitimate for him

         to act in his own discretion as indicated by us in paragraph 300.

         However, the general rule remains that the Governor acts upon the

         aid and advice of the State Council of Ministers.
The observations made in
B.K. Pavitra
(supra) that “a

         discretion is conferred upon the Governor to follow one of the

         courses of action enunciated in the substantive part of Article 200”

         do not take into consideration the decision of
Samsher Singh
(supra) and is for this reason per incuriam.
It failed to consider that
Article 200
which had been duly considered by
Samsher Singh
(supra) was found to contain only one instance where the exercise

         of discretion was expressly provided, that being the second proviso

         thereto. Besides this, as already aforestated, it failed to notice the

         removal of the expression “in his discretion” from Section 75 of

         the GoI Act, 1935 which ultimately culminated into
Article 200.
(XVII) Under
Article 201
, the occasion for the reservation of a bill for the

         consideration of the President by the Governor may arise where a

         constitutional provision makes the assent of the President to be a

         condition precedent to a State legislation becoming enforceable or

         for the purpose of securing some immunity to the State legislation.

         Such a requirement can be found in
Articles 31A
, 31C
, 254(2)
,
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 397 of 414
288(2)
, 360(4)(a)(ii)
etc. The second proviso to
Article 200
also

         makes reservation for the consideration of the President mandatory.

         As we have also discussed, there may be certain other situations

         where by peril to fundamental principles of representative

         democracy, the Governor may, in exercise of his discretion, reserve

         a bill for the consideration of the President.
(XXII) The determining factor in deciding whether a power would be

         subject to judicial review is the subject-matter of such power and

         not its source.
Indra Sawhney
(supra) observed that the yardstick

         of subjecting an act or a decision to judicial review is not whether

         it is a legislative act or an executive decision on a policy matter but

         whether it violates any constitutional guarantee or the rights under

         Part III of the Constitution. The Governor, wherever he acts in his
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 400 of 414
discretion under the Constitution, does so by virtue of his position

         as the constitutional and formal head of the State. It has been held

         in a catena of decisions that exercise of any power under the

         Constitution must conform to the limits set by the Constitution

         itself.
Article 200
is no exception to this general rule.
(XXIII) In light of this, the observations made by this Court in
Hoechst
(supra) that the assent of the President is non-justiciable, cannot be

         stretched to mean that as a general rule, the exercise of powers by

         the Governor under
Article 200
in his discretion would also be

         immune from judicial review. While grant of assent by the

         Governor or the President, being acts which are generally taken

         upon the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers, may not be

         justiciable, the withholding of assent or reservation of bills for the

         consideration of the President by the Governor in exercise of his

         discretion which is subject to the limits defined by the Constitution,

         would be justiciable on the touchstone of judicially determinable

         standards.
This question being purely of a legal nature would be

                     completely justiciable and the competent court would

                     be, after a proper adjudication, fully authorized to

                     approve or disapprove of such reservation by the

                     Governor. If such a challenge finds favour with the

                     competent    court,   then,   subject    to     any    other
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                          Page 402 of 414
considerations, it would be a fit case for the issuance of

                     a writ in the nature of mandamus to the Governor for

                     appropriate action. If, however, the challenge should

                     fail then the mechanism envisaged under
Article 201
of

                     the Constitution will spring into action.
(v)      Where the Governor exhibits inaction in making a

                     decision when a bill is presented to him for assent under
Article 200
and such inaction exceeds the time-limit as

                     has been prescribed by us in paragraph 250 of this

                     judgment then it shall be open to the State Government

                     to seek a writ of mandamus from a competent court

                     against the Governor directing expeditious decision on

                     the concerned bill as is the mandate of the Constitution,

                     however, it is clarified that the Governor may

                     successfully resist such a challenge on providing

                     sufficient explanation for the delay caused.
b. Where the Governor reserves a bill for the consideration of the

            President and the President in turn withholds assent thereto then,

            it shall be open to the State Government to assail such an action

            before this Court. Such a challenge can broadly be made on the

            following grounds:
436. We are in no way undermining the office of the Governor. All we say is that

     the Governor must act with due deference to the settled conventions of

     parliamentary democracy; respecting the will of the people being expressed

     through the legislature as-well as the elected government responsible to the

     people. He must perform his role of a friend, philosopher and guide with

     dispassion, guided not by considerations of political expediency but by the

     sanctity of the constitutional oath he undertakes. In times of conflict, he must

     be the harbinger of consensus and resolution, lubricating the functioning of

     the State machinery by his sagacity, wisdom and not run it into a standstill.

     He must be the catalyst and not an inhibitor. All his actions must be impelled

     keeping in mind the dignity of the high constitutional office that he occupies.

             Entry 32 -- Incorporation, regulation and winding up of

7.   The Governor, on 04.12.2023, also sought to clarify that the 10 Bills to

     which he had withheld assent simpliciter were not returned to the Legislature

     for reconsideration as stipulated in the first proviso of
Article 200.
Despite

     that, the State Government had placed the Bills before the legislative

     assembly again. After the Bills were repassed by the legislative assembly,

     the State Government sent the same back to the Governor for assent. The

     Governor clarified that since the Bills suffered from repugnancy, he was

     reserving the said Bills for the consideration of the President. These

     clarifications were sent for all the 10 Bills. For reference, we have extracted
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                         Page 8 of 414
the relevant portion of the letter pertaining to the Tamil Nadu Fisheries

University (Amendment) Bill, 2023 which reads thus:
5.⁠ ⁠The Hon'ble Governor had not returned the Bills under the
             proviso to
Article 200
for re-consideration, however, State
             Government has sent them back. Since the Bill suffers from
             repugnancy, Hon'ble Governor has reserved the same for the
             consideration of the Hon'ble President.”
9.   Thus, what was sought to be conveyed by the aforesaid I.A. was that the 10

     Bills were reconsidered and passed again by the State Legislature and were

     thereafter forwarded to the Governor for his assent in terms of the first

     proviso to
Article 200.
However, the Governor reserved the said Bills for

     the consideration of the President. It was alleged that such action on the part

     of the Governor was violative of
Article 200
and was done with a mala fide

     intention only with a view to circumvent the jurisdiction of this Court.
28. Consequently, the petitioner was constrained to file I.A. No. 69967 of 2024

    on 18.03.2024 to amend its prayer in the present writ petition for including

    the relief of staying the operation of the Governor’s letter dated 17.03.2024

    and directing him to administer the oath of office and secrecy to Dr. K.

    Ponmudy. The amendment sought to be made reads thus:
iv)    He submitted that even the withholding of assent by the President

          under
Article 201
was by way of a non-speaking order and thus

          does not comply with the first proviso to the Article. Similar to
Article 200
, the withholding of assent under
Article 201
must

          necessarily result in a message under the first proviso. He

          summarised his arguments on this aspect by submitting that the acts

          of simpliciter withholding, reserving for the consideration of the

          President, delay by Governor, as well as simpliciter withholding of
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                         Page 27 of 414
assent by the President are all unconstitutional, and hence null and

         void.
iv)
Article 200
embodies an aspect of legislative procedure so as to

          make a Bill operative as an Act. Seen thus, it is imperative that the

          Governor acts upon the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers

          when exercising his power under
Article 200.
v)     Taking us through the historical background in which
Article 200
came to be drafted, Mr. Dwivedi submitted that Section 75 was the

          provision corresponding to
Article 200
in the
Government of India

          Act, 1935
. However, in Section 75 the expressions “Governor in
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 30 of 414
his discretion” and “Governor may, in his discretion” were

         deployed in the substantive part and the proviso respectively. Later

         on, when the draft of the Constitution was prepared by the

         constitutional advisor, the expression “Governor in his discretion”

         was dropped from the substantive part of
Article 147 (predecessor

         of draft
Article 175
), but the expression “Governor may, in his

         discretion” was retained in the proviso. The same position

         continued in
Article 175
of the Draft Constitution, 1948

         (hereinafter, “the Draft Constitution”) (predecessor of Article
vii) The interpretation of
Article 200
must be done in line with the

         intent of the framers of the Constitution which is evident from the

         Constituent Assembly Debates. The only instance where this Court

         adopted an approach contrary to the one suggested by the

         Constituent Assembly pertained to the appointment of Judges to the

         High Court and this Court and that approach was adopted to

         preserve the independence of the judiciary, which is part of the

         basic structure. However, in the present case, there is no compelling

         need to diverge from the view adopted by the Constituent Assembly

         as that view supports the fundamental principles of federalism.
d) Option of withholding of assent is attached to the first proviso to
Article 200.
b) The Governor cannot reserve a bill for the consideration of the
   President when it is repassed by the State Legislature, with or
   without amendments, under the first proviso to
Article 200?
iii)   Explaining the reason for the aforesaid, he submitted that upon

          exercising the second option, the third option no longer remains for

          the Governor as the first proviso to
Article 200
comes into

          operation.
Article 200
does not provide any scope to the Governor

          for the reservation of the bill once the second option has already

          been exercised. The decision of the Governor to go down the path

          of sending the bill back to the Legislature precludes him from

          reversing his constitutional election subsequently, by referring it to

          the President after the Bill is returned to him consequent to

          repassing by the Legislature.
c) The first proviso to
Article 200
is attached to the option of
   withholding of assent provided in the substantive part of the article.
i)    The concluding part of the first proviso stipulates that if the Bill is

         passed again by the Legislature either with or without amendments,

         the Governor shall not withhold assent therefrom upon

         presentation. The expression “shall not withhold assent therefrom”

         is a clear indicator that the exercise of the power under the first

         proviso is relatable to the withholding of the assent by the Governor

         to the bill in the first instance. This phrase constitutes a clear and

         unequivocal constitutional prohibition against the Governor. The

         role which is ascribed by the first proviso to the Governor is

         recommendatory in nature and it does not bind the State

         Legislature.
ii)   The first proviso to
Article 200
expands upon the second option to

         ensure that the object of the Article is not rendered otiose as without

         the first proviso,
Article 200
would allow the Governor to

         indiscriminately veto bills by repetitively and sequentially

         withholding the assent and cripple an elected Government for

         political reasons.
vii) Once the first proviso comes into operation, the State Legislature is

           bound to mandatorily reconsider the Bills and pass them with or

           without any amendments as indicated by the expression “House or

           Houses shall reconsider the Bill accordingly” in the second part of

           the first proviso to
Article 200.
d)        A time-limit must be read into the expression “as soon as
          possible” appearing in the first proviso to
Article 200
to curtail
          the prevalent practice of gubernatorial procrastination.
limit is fixed, it has to be exercised within a time which can be

            held to be reasonable.
f) Role of the President under
Article 201.
iii)   Just as the Governor, the President is also bound by the aid and

          advice of his Council of Ministers under
Article 201
of the

          Constitution. Such absence of compulsion of the President to grant

          assent to the Bill re-considered and repassed by the State

          Legislative Assembly is also subject to the aid and advice of the

          Council of Ministers. Whether the President should grant assent or

          not would be subject to the aid and advice by the Council of
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                         Page 50 of 414
Ministers. There is no individual discretion vested in the President

         in granting or not granting the assent under
Article 201.
i. Whether the first proviso could be said to provide an independent

                 course of action available to the Governor in addition to the three

                 options provided under the substantive part of
Article 200?
ii. In what manner the expression “the Bill falls through unless the

                 procedure under the first proviso is followed”, as used in
Valluri

                 Basavaiah Chowdhary
(supra), should be construed?
II)    Whether the Governor can reserve a bill for the consideration of
       the President at the time when it is presented to him for assent after
       being reconsidered in accordance with the first proviso to
Article
       200
, more particularly, when he had not reserved it for the
       consideration of the President in the first instance and had
       declared withholding of assent thereto?
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 62 of 414
i. How is the absence of an express time-limit in
Article 200
to be

          construed for ascertaining the manner in which the Governor is

          expected to exercise his powers under the said provision?

      ii. What is the import of the expression “as soon as possible”

          appearing in the first proviso to
Article 200?
37.
Article 200
appears in Chapter III of Part VI of the Constitution under the

      heading Legislative Procedure. Part VI deals with the States and Chapter III

      deals with the State Legislature. The marginal note attached to
Article 200
reads “Assent to Bills” and the article reads as follows:
38.
Section 75
of the Government of India Act, 1935 (for short, “the GoI Act,

    1935”) upon which the
Article 200
has been substantially modelled is

    reproduced hereinbelow:
39. A perusal of both the aforesaid provisions indicates that
Article 200
of the

     Constitution corresponds to Section 75 of the GoI Act, 1935 except for the

     following differences:
41.
Article 200
is divided into three parts - the substantive part and two provisos.
A perusal of the substantive part of
Article 200
indicates that the

     presentation of a bill to the Governor is mandatory after it is passed by the

     State legislature. The same is made evident from the use of the expression

     “it shall be presented to the Governor”. In the same breath,
Article 200
makes it mandatory for the Governor to make one of the following

     declarations:
43. The first proviso to
Article 200
has no application to Money Bills. For all

    other bills, it provides that the Governor may, as soon as possible after the

    presentation of the bill to him for assent, return the bill to the House or

    Houses along with a message requesting the House or the Houses to

    reconsider the bill in totality or certain provisions thereof. He may also

    recommend the introduction of certain amendments to the bill. The first

    proviso further states that when a bill is returned with such a message, then

    the House or the Houses must reconsider the bill accordingly and if the bill

    is passed with or without amendments and presented to the Governor for

    assent, he shall not withhold assent therefrom.
44. The second proviso to
Article 200
provides that if the Governor is of the

    opinion that a bill which is presented to him for assent would, upon

    becoming law, so derogate from the powers of the High Court as to endanger

    the position which that Court is designed to fill by the Constitution, then he

    must reserve the bill for the consideration of the President and not grant

    assent to it.
45. The heart of the controversy before us lies in the interpretation of the

    substantive part of
Article 200
and the first proviso to it. The arguments

    advanced before us coupled with the factual situation which we are

    confronted with, and the broader constitutional and political consequences
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 70 of 414
that an interpretation of
Article 200
entails, has opened up before us a

     treasure trove of questions hidden in the seemingly innocuous and plain

     language used in
Article 200.
46. For a better understanding of
Article 200
, it is necessary that we should first

     understand the concept of assent to bills, how it has evolved over the

     centuries and its importance in parliamentary democracies across the globe.

     We are undertaking this exercise as
Article 200
cannot be understood fully

     without having regard to the context in which it came to be included in the

     Constitution. While fidelity to the text of the provision holds paramount

     consideration in its interpretation, the context is equally, if not more,

     important, more so in light of the fact that
Article 200
, as its stands today,

     bears striking resemblance to Section 75 of the GoI Act, 1935 and other

     important historical documents which were being drafted by Indians during

     the course of the freedom struggle.
47. In Westminster styled polities, the Parliament consists of a lower House, an

     upper House and the head of state. The Indian Constitution has also broadly

     adopted a similar structure, which becomes evident from
Articles 79
and
168
respectively.
Article 79
provides that the Parliament shall consist of the

     President and two Houses - the Council of States and the House of the

     People.
Article 168
provides that each State shall have a Legislature which
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 71 of 414
shall comprise of the Governor and either one or two House(s), as the case

      may be. In the Westminster system, for a law to be passed by the Parliament,

      it must receive the approval of all the three elements - the Lower House, the

      Upper House and the Head of the State.
50. One of the first instances where the concept of assent to bills appears in a

     documented form in the Indian context is the Constitution of India Bill, 1895
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 73 of 414
which is also popularly referred to as the Swaraj Bill. The Bill, which is also

    termed by the academics as the first articulation of a constitutional

    imagination by Indians, besides incorporating ideas of free speech, equality

    before law, right to property, etc., also envisaged a machinery of governance

    and separation of powers, albeit within the British Empire. As regards the

    legislative structure, the Bill proposed that the Sovereign of Great Britain

    shall reign and rule over India and the Viceroy shall be the representative of

    the Sovereign in India. It further envisaged that the Viceroy would be the

    President of the Parliament and would have the power to veto any law

    enacted by the Indian Parliament and initiate legislation.
Article 97
of the

    Bill provided that no bill would become law until it received the sanction of

    the Sovereign. The said provision is reproduced hereinbelow:
1. The head of every Provincial Government shall be a
        Governor who shall not ordinarily belong to the Indian Civil
        Service or any of the permanent services.
52. In the backdrop of the growing demand for self-government by the Indian

    National Movement and the Montagu-Chelmsford Report, the Government

    of India Act, 1919 (for short, “the GoI Act, 1919”) was enacted and received

    assent of the British Crown in December, 1919. The legislation introduced

    dyarchy at the provincial level, by the introduction of the transferred list and

    the reserved list. The reserved list consisted of the subject matters on which

    the Governor enjoyed exclusive legislative powers. However, what we wish

    to draw attention to is the provision contained in the said legislation as

    regards assent to bills.
Section 12
provided that the Governor had four

    options to choose from when a bill was presented to him for assent - to

    declare assent, to withhold assent, to return the bill to the council for

    reconsideration or to reserve the bill for the consideration of the Governor-

    General. Notably, there was no requirement for the Governor to mandatorily

    assent to a bill upon its presentation after reconsideration. Further, the

    Governor had the power to veto any bill passed by the legislative council by

    a declaration simplicter of withholding of assent. There was also a provision

    for the lapse of a bill reserved for the consideration of the Governor-General

    if assent was not granted within a period of six months. Thus, the concept of

    both absolute and pocket veto could be said to have been available to the

    Governor and the Governor-General under the provisions of the GoI Act,

    1919. The relevant provision is reproduced hereinbelow:
governor or chief commissioner relating thereto, the
            Bill, if re-affirmed with or without amendment, may
            be again presented to the governor, lieutenant-
53. A reading of the aforesaid provision also indicates that at the time of drafting
Article 200
, the framers of the Constitution not only had before them Section

     75 of the GoI Act, 1935 but also Section 12 of the GoI Act, 1919 as well as

     other possible variations about which we shall discuss in the following

     paragraphs. However, certain features of
Article 200
, namely, the absence

     of automatic lapse upon not receiving approval, mandatory requirement for

     the Governor to not withhold assent to a bill which is presented to him after

     being reconsidered by the legislature and absence of the expression “in his

     discretion”, must be viewed in the context of gradual dilution of the role and
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                         Page 78 of 414
powers of the Governor in provincial governance as the country neared

         independence.
54. The concept of assent by the Sovereign found mention in Section 75 of the

         GoI Act, 1935 and
Article 200
as it stands today is predominantly modelled

         according to the version which existed therein. However, before we proceed

         to discuss Section 75 of the GoI Act, 1935 and how it eventually evolved

         into
Article 200
of the Constitution, we deem it appropriate to briefly shed

         light on how other aspirational constitutional documents, drafted during the

         course of the freedom struggle, imagined the practice of assent to bills and

         made certain modifications to the practice that prevailed in the United

         Kingdom.
55. The Commonwealth of India Bill, 1925 that was drafted by the National

         Convention had a lasting impact on the eventual framing of our Constitution

         as regards the idea of royal assent.
Article 39
of the said Bill provided that a

         bill passed by the Parliament would be presented to the Viceroy for

         obtaining the King’s assent. Similarly, for the provinces,
Article 83
provided

         that the bills passed by the provincial legislature would be presented to the

         Governor for obtaining the King’s assent. However, what is relevant to note
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                         Page 79 of 414
is that the provisions were not elaborate as regards the procedure and scope

     of powers of the Sovereign while taking a decision on the aspect of assent.
- to signify assent, to withhold assent or to reserve the bill for consideration

     by the British Crown. Notably, there was no obligation on the Governor-

     General to signify assent after a bill was repassed with or without the

     amendments suggested by him. The relevant provision is reproduced

     hereinbelow:
58. As regards the provincial legislature, a bill passed by the provincial

    legislature had to be assented to by the Governor before it would become an

    Act. The Governor had two options - to declare assent or to withhold assent.

    Notably, the Governor did not have the option to reserve the bill for the

    consideration of the Governor-General. However, every bill after receiving

    the assent of the Governor had to be mandatorily referred to and assented by

    the Governor-General failing which the Act would have no validity. Even

    after receiving the assent of the Governor-General, the Act could be
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 81 of 414
disallowed by the King and would thereupon become void. The relevant

    provisions are reproduced hereinbelow:
40. Where the Governor-General withholds his assent from
            any such Act, he shall signify to the Governor in writing his
            reason for so withholding his assent.
42. Where the disallowance of an Act has been so signified,
            the Governor shall forthwith notify the disallowance, and
            thereupon the Act, as from the date of the notification shall
            become void accordingly.”
60. A perusal of the above indicates that the Governor had the option of either

    assenting to or withholding a bill presented before him. However, in the

    latter case, the Governor was under an obligation to return the bill for

    reconsideration with his own recommendations, whereupon the provincial

    legislature was required to reconsider the bill in light of the

    recommendations made. Upon being passed again, with or without

    amendments, the bill would be deemed to have been assented to by the
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 83 of 414
Governor. However, it would become an Act only upon being assented to

    by the President, who would signify his assent to the Governor. Thus, the

    President was vested with the power to veto any bill which had not been

    assented to by the Governor and was passed again after reconsideration with

    or without the amendments recommended by the Governor. This was in

    contrast to the position with respect to the Federal Legislature, wherein no

    veto power was conferred on the President. The relevant provision read as

    follows:
63. Besides the aspirational constitutional documents
referred to above
, it is also

     pertinent to discuss how assent was envisaged by one of the first indigenous

     constitutional documents that was implemented in practice as well. Section

     15 of the Aundh State Constitution Act, 1939 that was purportedly enacted

     to grant self-rule to the people of the Aundh princely state, laid down the

     procedure for assent to bills. The relevant provision read as follows:
69.
Article 147
of the Draft Constitution, prepared by the constitutional adviser,

     Shri B.N. Rau, dealt with assent to bills passed by the provincial legislature

     and read as follows:
70.
Article 147
as reproduced aforesaid made significant departure from Section

    75 of the GoI Act, 1935 as follows:
ii.   Debates of the Constituent Assembly on
Article 200
of the Constitution
72. When
Article 175
of the Draft Constitution, 1948 was taken up for

      consideration by the Constituent Assembly, certain amendments were

      moved by Dr. B.R. Ambedkar that came to be accepted, leading to the

      adoption of the draft
Article 175
as
Article 200
of our Constitution. The

      amendments were:
77. Shri. T.T. Krishnamachari also emphasized that under the newly proposed

        draft
Article 175
, more specifically the first proviso, the Governor will not

        be exercising his discretion in the matter of referring a bill back to the House

        with a message. The Governor would exercise his power under the first

        proviso only upon the advice of his Council of Ministers. According to him,

        the first proviso was to be exercised in situations wherein the House has

        already accepted and endorsed a provision, but the Ministry was of the

        opinion that certain modifications are required to be made in the said

        provision. It is only when such an occasion arises that the procedure
4
9, CONSTITUENT ASSEMB. DEB., (Aug. 1, 1949) 61.
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                         Page 94 of 414
envisaged under the first proviso would be resorted to. The Council of

        Ministers would use the Governor to hold up further proceedings of the bill

        and remit it to the Lower House with the message informing the legislature

        about the modifications sought to be made to the bill by the Ministry. He

        drew attention to the words of Dr. Ambedkar on this aspect and stated as

        follows:
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                         Page 95 of 414
might have undertaken with respect to the bill in question, or, it could also

     be seen as providing some scope to the Ministry to take certain additional

     actions that the Ministry feels should be taken in order to meet the popular

     opinion reflected outside the House in some form or another. Therefore, the

     operation of the first proviso does not abridge the power of the Legislature

     or the Ministry responsible to it, rather, it further curtails the Governor’s

     power from the position that was envisaged in the original first proviso,

     which is now sought to be supplanted.
79. In light of the debate which took place as regards the substitution of the first

     proviso to draft
Article 175
, the amendment was put to vote and the same

     was successfully adopted by the Constituent Assembly.
80. On 17th of October, 1949, T.T. Krishnamachari moved an amendment that a

     second proviso to
Article 175
also be added, which later came to be adopted

     by the Constituent Assembly. Dr. B.R. Ambedkar elucidated that the second

     proviso that was proposed to be moved, was a part of the Instrument of

     Instructions issued to the Governor of the provinces under the GoI, 1935.

     Paragraph 17 of the Instrument of Instructions read as follows:
82. It was the opinion of Dr. B.R. Ambedkar that any such bill or Act as

        illustrated above would amount to a derogation from the authority that the

        Constitution confers or intends to confer upon the High Court. This is why

        it was felt necessary that before such a law becomes final, the President must

        be given an opportunity to examine whether such a law should be permitted

        to take effect or not. Such a shield was considered imperative keeping in

        mind the important constitutional position that the High Courts hold in

        adjudicating disputes. Dr. B.R. Ambedkar had emphasized on the

        importance of the second proviso as follows:
i.    First Administrative Reforms Commission, 1966.
87. As the discretionary powers of the Governor affect some of the vital issues

    in the functioning of democratic governments in the States, the ARC

    underscored the importance of evolving guidelines to enable the exercise of

    such discretionary powers for the purpose of preserving and protecting

    democratic values. It was noted that such guidelines would serve the purpose

    of securing uniformity in action and eliminate all suspicions of partisanship

    and arbitrariness.
93. The Commission observed that while exercising his functions, the Governor

    should not be under any pressure from an external authority. To explain the

    position of discretionary powers of the Governor, the Commission referred

    to the speech of the former Vice President of India, Shri G.S. Pathak, which

    reads thus:
102. A discussion of the recommendations of the Commission in this regard

     would be beneficial to our examination of
Articles 200
and
201
respectively

     and the role of the Governor in the contemporary federal polity.



a.    Scope of Governor’s Discretion Under
Article 200
106. While addressing suggestions of some State governments that the

     discretionary powers of the Governor must be curtailed or removed as it

     presents a potential threat to the autonomy of the States, the Commission

     observed that the makers of the Constitution advisedly refrained from

     putting such discretionary powers in a straitjacket rigid definition. It noted

     that the Constitution is ever evolving and the ways in which its provisions

     and principles may be tampered with or circumvented, cannot be foreseen.

     Therefore, the office of the Governor should be afforded enough flexibility

     to react in any situation and his discretion to approach a matter cannot be

     pre-determined.
b.    Interplay of
Articles 200
And
254
respectively of the Constitution.
107.
Article 246(2)
endows the Parliament as well as the State legislatures with

     the competence to legislate on entries under List III i.e., the concurrent list.

     The provision under
Article 254
is appurtenant to the concurrent exercise of
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 110 of 414
legislative competence by the Parliament and State legislature insofar as

     there is any inconsistency or repugnancy between the laws of the respective

     legislatures.
109. The Commission highlighted that clause (2) of
Article 254
is applicable only

     when the following two conditions are cumulatively met:
It is upon satisfaction of both these conditions that the Governor can reserve

     a bill for Presidential consideration under
Article 254(2).
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 111 of 414
c.    Scope of Union Executive’s Discretion under
Article 201
111. As per the report of the Commission, a State bill, once reserved for the

     consideration of the President (upon the aid and advice of the Council of

     Ministers), is made subject to the procedure prescribed under
Article 201
and the Union Executive is entitled to examine it from all angles such as,

     inter alia, conformity to legislative or executive policy of the Union,

     harmony with the scheme and provisions of the Constitution, vires of the

     bill, etc.
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                    Page 112 of 414
114. The Commission did not make any specific prescription in respect of
Article

     143
of the Constitution, which enables the President and by extension, the

     Union Council of Ministers to seek the opinion of the Supreme Court in
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 113 of 414
respect of bills which may be deemed to be unconstitutional and left the

     decision up to the President to make such a reference in appropriate cases.



d.    Impropriety of Conditional Assent by the President
117. The Commission, cognizant of the misgivings and irritations in Union-State

     relations due to delays in the process of securing Presidential assent,

     recommended that the procedure of making a reference to the President by

     the State Government through the Governor and the consideration thereof

     by the Union Government must be streamlined. It was also endorsed that the

     Governments at both the Centre and State level may benefit from a prior

     consultation at the stage of drafting of the bill itself and prescribing time-

     limits for disposal, which ought to be made convention and practice.
120. With regard to prescription of such timelines, the Commission proposed the

    following timelines to be treated as salutary conventions:
g.    Withholding of Assent by the President
h.    Recommendations given by the Commission
125. The Commission classified State bills to be reserved for the consideration of

     the President as follows:
(i)    To secure immunity from operation of
Articles 14
and
(a) acquisition of estates, etc. [First Proviso to
Article
                       31A(I)];
(b) giving effect to Directive Principles of State Policy
                       (Proviso to
Article 31C
).
(ii) A Bill relating to a subject enumerated in the
                   Concurrent List, to ensure operation of its provisions
                   despite their repugnancy to a Union law or an existing
                   law, by securing President's assent in terms of
Article
                   254(2).
(iii) Legislation imposing restrictions on trade and
                   commerce requiring Presidential sanction under the
                   Proviso to
Article 304(b)
read with
Article 255.
a.    Role of the Governor
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 122 of 414

b.    Discretionary Powers of the Governor
134. Upon a perusal of
Article 163(2)
, the Commission was of the view that the

     said provision gives the impression that the Governor has a wide and

     undefined area of discretionary powers. However, the scope of the

     discretionary powers of the Governor has to be narrowly construed. The

     language of
Article 163(2)
cannot be taken to mean that the Governor has a

     general discretionary power to act against the aid and advice of the Council

     of Ministers.


137. The Commission suggested that definite timelines ought to be adopted as

     salutary conventions for the Governor to either provide assent or reserve the

     bill for the consideration of the President. Similarly, there should be a time

     limit for the President to take a decision on the State bill under
Article 201
of the Constitution. The Commission was of the view that concrete timelines

     are sine qua non for the exercise of powers under
Articles 200
and
201
respectively so as to avoid dissensions between the Central and State

     governments.

138. The Commission noted that the substantive part of
Article 200
does not

     stipulate time period within which the Governor has to either assent,

     withhold assent or reserve the bill for Presidential consideration. The

     requirement of expediency is incumbent upon the Governor only when he

     decides to return the bill to the State legislature for reconsideration. The

     same was considered to be evident from the expression “as soon as

     possible”.
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 125 of 414
139. The Commission noted that while the expression “as soon as possible” is

    mentioned in
Article 200
albeit only in the first proviso thereof, there is no

    such compulsion on the President under
Article 201.
As a result, the

    President or the Union Government may kill the bill by not taking a decision

    on the same, sometimes for the entire duration of the State legislature. This

    increases the scope for abuse of discretion by the Union government based

    on political considerations particularly when the ruling party in the State

    concerned is different from the one enjoying power at the Union level. The

    lack of a reasonable timeline allows the executive fiat to make inroads into

    the legislative power of the State thereby thwarting the democratic will of

    the State legislature. Such invasion of the powers of the State legislature by

    the Union Executive is questionable in the context of ‘basic features’ of the

    Constitution.

d.    Recommendations
(b) Delete the words ""or that he withholds assent therefrom"".
             In other words, the power to withhold assent, conferred upon
             the Governor, by
Article 200
should be done away with;
(f) In the alternative it may be more advisable to delete
             altogether the words in
Article 200
empowering the
             Governor to reserve a Bill for the consideration of the
             President except in the case contemplated by the second
             proviso to
Article 200
and in cases where the Constitution
             requires him to do so. Such a course would not only
             strengthen the federal principle but would also do away with
             the anomalous situation, whereunder a Bill passed by the
             State Legislature can be 'killed' by the Union Council of
             Ministers by advising the President to withhold his assent
             thereto or just by cold-storaging it.”

F.    INTERNATIONAL JURISPRUDENCE ON ASSENT TO BILLS
144. The position in the United Kingdom is that once a bill has passed through

      all parliamentary stages in both Houses, it is poised for the conferment of

      ‘royal assent’. Historically, the Sovereign granted assent to bills in person

      in the House of Lords, attended by the Lords Commissioners. This formal

      ceremony was known as the ‘Royal Assent ceremony’. The Royal Assent

      ceremony continued until 1967, when the British Parliament passed the

      Royal Assent Act wherein the requirement of grant of assent in person by the

      monarch was made voluntary. Although granting assent is a personal

146. The only ground on which assent may be withheld, that too solely on

     ministerial advice, is if the bill has failed to comply with mandatory

     procedural requirements or if there has been a change in government

     between the bill’s approval and its presentation for assent. Section 4 of the

     Judicial Committee Act, 1833 provides that the Sovereign may refer a bill to

     the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council for an advisory opinion on

     whether such bill contravenes a fundamental constitutional principle.

     However, the position in the UK does not clarify whether the Sovereign can

     initiate such a referral independently.

b.    Canada
147. Canada’s Royal Assent ceremony traces its origins to the United Kingdom.

148. Section 3 of the Royal Assent Act, 2002 (Can) provides that assent may be

     given ‘in Parliament assembled’ or through a written declaration, provided

it is witnessed by more than one member from each House.
The Act
stipulates that the Royal Assent must be given in the Senate Chamber at least

    twice a year and for the first appropriation bill of each session of the

    Parliament. In all other cases, such assent may be granted by the Governor

    General or her Deputy by written consent. At the provincial level, assent is

    given by the Lieutenant Governor, who is appointed by the Governor

    General. As per Section 57 of the Constitution Act, 1867, when bills are

    reserved for Queen’s pleasure, she acts upon ministerial advice rather than

    the advice of the Houses.

152. The Constitution of the United States, more particularly, Article I,
Section

     7
, Clause 2 thereof states that once a bill has been passed by the House of

     Representatives and the Senate, it must be presented to the President. If the

     President approves, he may sign the bill; otherwise, he may return it with his

     objections for reconsideration. If, after reconsideration, two-thirds of both

     the Houses passes the bill, it becomes law. Further, if the President does not

     sign a bill within ten days of presenting the same, while Congress is in

     session, the bill automatically becomes law. Therefore, in this limited

     circumstance, the concept of pocket veto is not available to the President.

     However, if Congress adjourns while the bill is awaiting assent and the

     President does not sign the bill within ten days, the bill does not become law.
d.    New Zealand
153. The colonial legislative framework of New Zealand under the
Constitution

     Act, 1852
, vested structured discretion in provincial authorities while

     maintaining the supremacy of the Crown.
Section 27
of the Constitution Act,

     1852 stipulated that every bill passed by the Provincial Council must be

     presented to the Superintendent who was an elected head of each Provincial

     Council, for the assent of the Governor who was the representative of the

     monarch. The Superintendent, in his discretion, could have either granted

     assent on behalf of the Governor or withheld assent or reserved the bill for

     the Governor’s pleasure. For a bill to become law, Superintendent had to

signify Governor’s assent. Further, her Majesty, with the advice of her Privy

     Council could issue instructions to the Governor to guide him in exercise of

     his powers to assent to, dissent from, or reserve bills for her Majesty’s

     pleasure. The Governor was required to act in obedience to these

     instructions.

e.    Australia
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 136 of 414
155. The structure of governance in Australia reflects a nuanced distribution of

        the Queen’s powers through her representatives at both national and state

        levels. The Queen of Australia is the formal Head of State. At the national

        level, the Queen’s powers and functions qua the Government of Australia

        are exercised by the Governor-General of Australia. At the State level, her

        powers are exercised by the Governor of the State. As per Section 2(1) of

        the Constitution Act, 1889, the legislative powers were vested in the

        Sovereign and exercised by her colonial Governors, subject to the advice of

        legislators. At the national level, Governor-General is not given ministerial

        advice on assent, the Presiding Officer of the House requests for assent and

        the Attorney General provides a certificate to the Governor-General

        regarding whether the bill needs to be reserved for the Queen’s assent or

        regarding any corrections.9

f.    Ireland
157. Ireland’s constitutional order provides a unique provision enabling the

     President to refer bills to the Supreme Court for its view on the

     constitutionality of the bills.
Article 26
of the Constitution of the Ireland

     confers a power on the President, who, after consultation with the Council

     of State, may refer any bill to the Supreme Court for a decision on whether

     any provisions of the bill are repugnant to the Constitution. Such reference

     must be within seven days from the presentation of the bill to the President.

     If the Supreme Court holds that any provision of the bill is repugnant to the

     Constitution, the President declines to sign such bill.
g.    Republic of Singapore
158. The Constitution of Singapore establishes a structured framework for the

     exercise of presidential discretion, setting clear time limits for decision-

     making while also ensuring safeguards against legislative overreach.

W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                     Page 138 of 414
21A
of the Constitution stipulates the general time limit for the President to

     exercise his discretionary powers. It provides that when the Constitution

     grants the President discretion in granting or refusing assent, concurrence,

     approval, or confirmation, he must signify his decision within the specified

     period after it is sought. The time period specified for granting assent ranges

     from thirty days to six weeks. However, it may be extended contingent upon

     any agreement between the President and the Cabinet.
159. Article 22H applies in cases where the bill or any provision seeks to curtail

     discretionary powers of the President. If, within thirty days, the President

     neither withholds assent nor refers the bill to the tribunal for its opinion on

     whether the bill curtails the President’s discretionary powers, then the

     President is deemed to have assented. Even when the tribunal is of the

     opinion that the bill does not curtail the discretionary powers conferred on

     the President, the President is still deemed to have assented.
160. The Constitution of Sri Lanka, more particularly, Article 154H, stipulates

     that upon the presentation of a statute enacted by the Provincial Council, the

     Governor shall either assent to it or return it for reconsideration as soon as

     possible. The Provincial Council may then pass the statute with or without

     amendments. If the statute is presented to the Governor again, he may

reserve it for reference by the President to the Supreme Court within one

     month of its second time, seeking a determination as to whether is

     inconsistent with the Constitution. If the Supreme Court holds the statute to

     be consistent, the Governor must grant assent. If it is held inconsistent, the

     Governor may withhold assent. It can be concluded that, upon the first

     presentation of a bill, the Governor has only two options: granting assent or

     returning it for reconsideration. On the second presentation, the Governor

     may only reserve the bill, referring it to the President for submission to the

     Supreme Court. He does not have the discretion to withhold assent

     independently.

i.    Republic of Kiribati
161. The constitutional framework of Kiribati is similar to the Democratic

     Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka. It provides powers to withhold assent only

     in exceptional situations. Section 66 of the Constitution of Kiribati allows

     the Beretitenti, that is the head of the state and head of the government, to

     withhold assent to a bill only if he believes the bill to be inconsistent with

     the Constitution. In such a case, the bill is returned to the Parliament for

     amendment, and if it is presented again and the Beretitenti still believes that

     the bill is inconsistent with the Constitution, he is required to refer it to the

     High Court for a declaration. If the Court declares that the bill is not

consistent with the Constitution, the Beretitenti must grant assent forthwith.
If the Court declares the bill to be inconsistent, it is sent back to Parliament.

     The Constitution of Zimbabwe under Section 131 provides a time period of

     twenty-one days to either assent to the bill or refer it for reconsideration.
j.    Republic of Fiji
162. The Constitution of Fiji, 2013 also does not vest discretionary power in the

     President. While Section 53 of the Fiji Independence Order, 1970 and

     Constitution of Fiji granted the Governor-General the power to grant assent

     or withhold assent, the Constitution of Fiji, 2013, removed any discretion on

     the part of the President. Section 48 of the Constitution stipulates that once

     a bill is passed, the Speaker must present it to the President for assent, which

     must be granted within seven days; otherwise, the bill is deemed to have

     received assent.

k.    Solomon Islands & Antigua and Barbuda
163. Both the Solomon Islands and Antigua and Barbuda have constitutional

     provisions that mandate the Governor-General to grant assent to bills passed

     by Parliament. In the Solomon Islands, Section 59(2) of the Constitution of

     the Soloman Islands provides that when a bill has been passed by the

     Parliament it shall be presented to the Governor-General who shall assent to
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 141 of 414
it forthwith on behalf of the Head of the State. Whereas Section 52(2) of the

     Constitution of Antigua and Barbuda states that when a bill is presented to

     the Governor-General for assent in accordance with this Constitution, he

     shall signify that he assents thereto.

l.    Islamic Republic of Pakistan
164. In our neighboring country,
Article 75
of the Constitution of the Islamic

     Republic of Pakistan provides that when a bill is presented to the President,

     he must either assent within ten days or return it to Parliament with a request

     for reconsideration. If the bill is passed again by a majority, whether

     amended or not, the President must grant assent within ten days, failing

     which it will be deemed to have received assent. Whereas
Article 105
stipulates that the Governor shall act in accordance with the advice of the

     Cabinet or the Chief Minister. The Governor may, however, require the

     Cabinet or the Chief Minister to reconsider the advice. Following such

     reconsideration, the Governor must act in accordance with the advice

     tendered within ten days.

m.    Federal Republic of Germany
165. The legislative process in Germany is governed by both federal and state

     constitutional provisions.
Article 76
of the Basic Law for the Federal

     Republic of Germany states that bills are to be introduced in Bundestag
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 142 of 414
(house elected by the people) by the Federal Government or by the

     Bundesrat (federal council). The provision grants the Bundesrat a period of

     six weeks to comment on bills for Federal Government bills. The Federal

     Government submits the bills, alongwith its views, to the Bundestag within

     six weeks alongwith its views.
Article 78
provides that a bill adopted by the

     Bundestag become the law if the Bundesrat consents to it. Laws enacted in

     accordance with the provisions of the Basic Law, after being countersigned,

     are certified by the Federal President. Furthermore, Section 60, Section V,

     the Constitution of Berlin stipulates that the bills shall be signed by the

     President of the House of Representatives without delay and then

     promulgated by the Governing Mayor within two weeks.
n.    Italian Republic
166. The legislative process in Italy is shaped by constitutional provisions that

     define the President’s role in the promulgation of laws and the scope of

     legislative urgency.
Article 73
of the Constitution of the Italian Republic

     mandates that laws be promulgated by the President within one month of

     their approval. However, if the Chambers (the Parliament consists of the

     Chamber of Deputies and the Senate of the Republic), by a majority vote,

     declare a bill to be urgent, it shall be promulgated within the time specified

     by the bill itself.
Article 74
empowers the President to request a new

     deliberation by means of a message stating the reasons for such a request. It
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 143 of 414
is important to take note that if the Chambers pass the bill once again, then

     the law must to be promulgated.

o.    French Republic
167. In France, the promulgation of legislation is subject to defined constitutional

     timelines.
Article 10
of the Constitution of October 4, 1958, stipulates that

     the President of the Republic must promulgate Acts of Parliament within

     fifteen days after the final passage of an Act. It also empowers the President

     to request Parliament to reopen the debate on the Act, or any specific

     sections thereof, and such a request for reopening of debate shall not be

     refused.

p.    Japan
168. As per the Japanese constitutional framework, the Diet (Parliament of Japan)

     is the sole law-making organ of the State.
Article 59
envisages that if a bill

     passed by the House of Representatives is rejected by the House of

     Councillors, it becomes a law when passed a second time by the House of

     Representatives by a two-thirds majority of the members present.
Article 74
states that all laws and cabinet orders must be signed by the competent

     Minister of State and countersigned by the Prime Minister.
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 144 of 414
169. A plain reading of
Article 200
of the Constitution indicates that when a bill

     is passed by the legislature of a State, it is mandatorily required to be placed

     before the Governor for his assent. This is because without receiving the

     assent of the President, a bill cannot become an Act. However, when a bill

     is presented to the Governor for his assent, the Governor is required to make

     a declaration from the three options available to him under the substantive

     part of
Article 200
, that is, to assent, to withhold assent, or to reserve the bill

     for the consideration of the President.

170. The first proviso prescribes a mechanism whereby the Governor may return

     a bill, which is not a Money Bill, back to the State legislature requesting

     them to reconsider the bill or certain provisions thereof or consider the

     possibility of making certain amendments to it. Once a bill is so returned by

     the Governor, the State legislature is required to take note of the suggestions

     made by the Governor and reconsider the bill accordingly. If the bill, after

     such reconsideration by the State Legislature is again passed and presented

     to the Governor, then in such circumstances as per the first proviso, the

     Governor would then be prohibited from withholding his assent to the bill.
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                          Page 145 of 414
171. The second proviso provides for a specific situation wherein the Governor

    is mandated to reserve a bill for the consideration of the President if, in his

    opinion, the bill upon becoming law, would so derogate from the powers of

    the High Court as to endanger the position which the High Court has been

    designed to fill by the Constitution.

172. One of the principal contentions advanced by the learned Attorney General

    before us was that the first proviso to
Article 200
provides an independent

    fourth course of action to the Governor besides the three other options

    available to him under the substantive part of the Article. To put it

    differently, his argument was that the Governor may either withhold assent

    to a bill simpliciter, as provided under the substantive part of
Article 200
, or

    he may invoke the procedure prescribed under the first proviso and return

    the bill back to the State legislature along with such a message as is

    mentioned in the first proviso. In other words, he contended that where the

    Governor declares a simpliciter withholding of assent, the same would be an

    absolute veto of the bill, and the State legislature would have no occasion to

    reconsider the bill in such a scenario. As a corollary the first proviso would

    have no applicability and the State legislature would not be entitled to

    reconsider the bill on its own motion.

W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                     Page 148 of 414

W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 150 of 414
21. The second proviso impacts upon the option which is
        provided by the substantive part of
Article 200
to the
        Governor to reserve a Bill for the consideration of the
        President by making it mandatory in the situation envisaged
        there. The option of reserving a Bill for the consideration of
        the President is turned into a mandate where the Governor
        has no option but to reserve it for the consideration of the
        President. The second proviso is, therefore, in the nature of
        an exception to the option which is granted to the Governor
        by the substantive part of
Article 200
to reserve any Bill for
        the consideration of the President.
22. A proviso, as is well settled, may fulfil the purpose of
        being an exception. Sometimes, however, a proviso may be in
        the form of an explanation or in addition to the substantive
        provision of a statute. The first proviso allows the Governor,
        where the Bill is not a Money Bill to send it back to the
        legislature together with a message. In terms of the message,
        the legislature may be requested by the Governor to
        reconsider the entirety of the Bill. This may happen for
        instance where the Governor believes that the entirety of the
        Bill suffers from an infirmity. Alternatively, the Governor
        may request the legislature to reconsider any specific
        provision of the Bill. While returning the Bill, the Governor
        may express the desirability of introducing an amendment in
        the Bill. The desirability of an amendment may arise with a
        view to cure an infirmity or deficiency in the Bill. The
        concluding part of the first proviso however stipulates that if
        the Bill is passed again by the legislature either with or
        without amendments, the Governor shall not withhold assent
        therefrom upon presentation. The concluding phrase “shall
        not withhold assent therefrom” is a clear indicator that the
        exercise of the power under the first proviso is relatable to
        the withholding of the assent by the Governor to the Bill in
        the first instance. That is why in the concluding part, the first
        proviso indicates that upon the passing of the Bill by the
        legislature either with or without amendments, the Governor
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 154 of 414
shall not withhold assent. The role which is ascribed by the
        first proviso to the Governor is recommendatory in nature
        and it does not bind the State Legislature.
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 155 of 414
25. The Governor, as an unelected Head of the State, is
        entrusted with certain constitutional powers. However, this
        power cannot be used to thwart the normal course of law-
        making by the State Legislatures. Consequently, if the
        Governor decides to withhold assent under the substantive
        part of
Article 200
, the logical course of action is to pursue
        the course indicated in the first proviso of remitting the Bill
        to the State Legislature for reconsideration. In other words,
        the power to withhold assent under the substantive part of
Article 200
must be read together with the consequential
        course of action to be adopted by the Governor under the first
        proviso. If the first proviso is not read in juxtaposition to the
        power to withhold assent conferred by the substantive part of
Article 200
, the Governor as the unelected Head of State
        would be in a position to virtually veto the functioning of the
        legislative domain by a duly elected legislature by simply
        declaring that assent is withheld without any further
        recourse. Such a course of action would be contrary to
        fundamental principles of a constitutional democracy based
        on a Parliamentary pattern of governance. Therefore, when
        the Governor decides to withhold assent under the
        substantive part of
Article 200
, the course of action which is
        to be followed is that which is indicated in the first proviso.
        The Governor is under
Article 168
a part of the legislature
        and is bound by the constitutional regime.


186. A close reading of the first proviso reveals that the action of returning the

     bill to the State legislature by the Governor is qualified by the expression

     “as soon as possible”. However, once the bill has been returned to the State

     legislature by the Governor, there is no such expediency required on part of

     the State legislature in reconsidering the bill. Further, once the bill is

     reconsidered and passed again by the State legislature, there is again a

     mandate on the Governor not to withhold assent to such a bill. The only

     obligation upon the State legislature is to mandatorily take into consideration

     the suggestions contained in the message sent by the Governor along with

     the bill. However, the State Legislature is not under an obligation to
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 158 of 414
mandatorily introduce any amendments suggested by the Governor and it

     may proceed to repass the bill without any amendments.
187. Since there is no obligation on the State legislature to repass the bill returned

     by the Governor under the first proviso, the expression “falls-through” can

     only refer to those situations where the State legislature elects not to pass

     the bill for reconsideration again, and in such circumstances causing the bill

     to lapse. There is nothing in the first proviso which gives the Governor the

     discretion to initiate the procedural machinery described therein. Therefore,

     the first proviso, cannot be treated as an independent course of action

     severable from the option of withholding of assent. The use of the expression

     “as soon as possible” in the first proviso makes it clear that the Constitution

     has imposed a sense of urgency upon the Governor and expects him to act

     with expediency if he decides to declare the withholding of assent. At the

     same time, that the use of the expression “may” in the first proviso, as

     explained in
State of Punjab
(supra) does not confer a discretion upon the

     Governor to decide whether to act in accordance with the procedure

     prescribed in the first proviso. On the contrary, it only denotes that the first

     proviso would be applicable only when the option of withholding of assent

     is exercised. In other words, the expression “may” is used keeping in mind

     that there are three options that the Governor may choose from when a bill

     is presented to him for assent.
Therefore, there is no requirement for
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 159 of 414
construing the expression “may” as “shall” as was vehemently urged on

     behalf of the petitioner, and the interpretation provided in
State of Punjab
(supra) and further explained by us does not merit construing the use of

     “may” as “shall”, as it would result in a logical absurdity insofar as it would

     make the compliance with the procedure
laid down in
the first proviso

     mandatory in the exercise of all three options available to the Governor

     under the substantive part of
Article 200
of the Constitution.
188. It is also remarkable to take note of the expression “if the bill is passed

     again” which signifies that the ultimate discretion to decide whether the

     State legislature wants to repass the bill or not continues to remain the

     prerogative of the State legislature alone. Similarly, the use of the expression

     “with or without amendment” denotes that even if the State legislature

     decides to reconsider the bill, the discretion to repass it with or without the

     amendments suggested by the Governor again continues to be their sole

     prerogative. In order to obviate any further confusion, we deem it

     appropriate to clarify that the use of the expression “shall reconsider the bill

     accordingly” does not indicate that it is obligatory for the State legislature

     to take up the bill for reconsideration. The word “shall” used in this

     expression must be read in conjunction with the word “accordingly”. The

     use of “shall” in this context is only for the limited purpose that if the State

     legislature in its discretion does decide to not allow the bill to “fall through”
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 160 of 414
by taking it up for reconsideration, then the scope of such reconsideration

     must at the very least encompass the suggestions communicated by the

     Governor in his message. The word “shall” used herein cannot be singled

     out and construed devoid of its context.

189. The structure of
Article 200
is also helpful in discerning the meaning of the

     content that it holds. There is a substantive part of the provision and there

     are two provisos to the substantive part. In the substantive part, there are

     three options for the Governor to choose from, each separated by the

     conjunction “or” thereby indicating the mutual exclusivity of the three

     options. If the Governor opts for the first option and grants assent to the bill

     presented to him, the first proviso doesn’t come into consideration.

     Similarly, if the Governor chooses the third option and reserves the bill for

     the consideration of the President, there is no occasion for the operation of

     first proviso. The second proviso is overarching in nature and provides that

     in the situation as described therein, the Governor can only exercise one

     option, that is, reserve the bill for the consideration of the President.
190. The use of the expression “shall declare” in the substantive part of
Article

     200
indicates that the Governor is required to make a declaration from the

     three choices provided to him under the substantive part and there cannot be

     any fourth course of action. As soon as assent is granted, the bill becomes
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 161 of 414
an Act and there is no scope thereafter for reservation for the consideration

    of the President or returning back to the State legislature. If reservation for

    the consideration of the President is declared then thereafter no returning of

    the bill to the State legislature can take place, unless the President so directs

    under the proviso to
Article 201.
Thus, it is only upon the declaration of

    withholding of assent that the first proviso is animates into action.
194. There is one another way of looking at
Article 200.
The procedure, as

    prescribed under the scheme of the provision, involves and envisages the

    actual motion of a bill from one constitutional authority to another. The

    Article starts with the requirement of the bill having to be mandatorily

    presented to the Governor after it has been passed by the State legislature.

    Thereafter, there is an obligation on the Governor to make a choice from one

    of the three options provided in the substantive part of the Article and also

    declare such a decision. Here, if assent is declared, then the bill becomes an
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 164 of 414
Act and the Government may thereafter take steps to notify the same in the

official Gazette. If the Governor declares that bill is being reserved for

consideration of the President as per the second proviso or otherwise, then

the bill travels from the Governor to the President, whereupon
Article 201
comes into play. The mechanism provided in the first proviso also envisages

the movement of the bill from the Governor to the State legislature and then

back to the Governor upon being passed again. The expression “as soon as

possible” appearing in the first proviso infuses a sense of urgency and

expediency in the mechanism of returning of bills by the Governor. It goes

without saying that the scheme of
Article 200
is characterized by the

movement of the bill from one constitutional authority to another and that

too with a sense of expediency. It is trite to say that
Article 200
occupies an

important role of giving the bills passed by the State legislature the authority

of an Act. Without the procedure envisaged under
Article 200
, the bills

remain mere pieces of paper, skeletons without any flesh or lifeblood

flowing through their veins, mere documentation of the aspirations of the

people without any possibility of bringing them to fruition. The only way by

which the option of withholding of assent provided in the substantive part

of
Article 200
can be reconciled with the scheme permeating the remainder

of the provision is by reading it in conjunction with the first proviso. It is

only when the withholding of assent is tempered with the requirement of

following the procedure prescribed in the first proviso that the constitutional
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 165 of 414
object of ensuring that the law-making machinery at the State level keeps on

     running unhindered can be fulfilled.
196. Thus, in light of the aforesaid discussion, it becomes clear that there are only

     three courses of action available to the Governor to choose from when a bill

     is presented to him for assent under
Article 200.
The first proviso is not an

     independent fourth course of action but intrinsically attached to the option

     of withholding of assent. In other words, the first proviso is clarificatory and

     only elaborates the procedure to be followed in case the option of

     withholding of assent is invoked by the Governor.
197. The use of the expression “shall” in the substantive part of
Article 200
read

     with the expression “as soon as possible” used in the first proviso indicates

     that there is no pocket veto available to the Governor while he is exercising

     the powers under
Article 200.
As we have also discussed in the subsequent
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 166 of 414
parts of this judgment, inaction on part of the Governor to take a decision

    when a bill is presented to him under
Article 200
is grossly violative of the

    constitutional scheme of expediency which permeates the provision.
200. We have also discussed in line with the decision in
State of Punjab
(supra)

      that the option of withholding of assent is attached with the first proviso and

      once the Governor declares the withholding of assent, the entire mechanism

      which is
laid down in
the first proviso itself has to follow suit. Thus, the first

      proviso to
Article 200
is a complete code in itself as regards the procedure

      which is to be followed once the Governor withholds assent and the rest of

      the article has no applicability thereafter.
201. It is also interesting to note that the expression “withhold assent” has been

     employed in the substantive part of
Article 200.
The literal meaning of the

     expression ‘withhold’ as defined in a number of dictionaries is to keep back;

     to keep in one’s possession what belongs to or is due to others; to hinder; to

     prevent; to defer; to postpone; to detain; to keep under control; to retain; to

     keep from doing something; to refrain from doing something. Thus, it would

     not be incorrect to construe that the option of withholding of assent has been

     provided to the Governor under the substantive part only with a view to defer

     or to postpone the grant of assent to a bill. Withholding of assent cannot be

     construed to be the same as denying of assent or as conferring a power in

     the Governor to veto a legislation passed by the State legislature, which

     would be against the very fundamentals of a representative democracy.
202. Further, the scope of this deferment of assent by the Governor has been made

     subject to the procedure
laid down in
the first proviso. The procedure
laid

     down in
the first proviso ensures that the withholding of assent does not

     become analogous to a pocket veto. The use of the expression “if the Bill is

     passed again by the House or Houses with or without amendment” in the

     first proviso clearly indicates that the role of the Governor under the first

     proviso has been characterized as recommendatory in nature and that his

     suggestions do not bind the legislature. Further, the expression “the
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 169 of 414
Governor shall not withhold assent therefrom” in the first proviso leaves no

    scope for the Governor to take any course of action other than discontinuing

    the withholding of assent, which by necessary implication means to accord

    assent to the bill. The expression also indicates that there is strict

    constitutional prohibition against the Governor to not withhold assent to the

    bill.
203. What follows from the aforesaid discussion is that once the option of

    withholding of assent is exercised by the Governor, the mechanism under

    the first proviso is set into motion to the exclusion of everything else

    envisaged under the article. This is in view of the maxim Expressio Unius

    Est Exclusio Alterius i.e., the expression of one thing is the exclusion of

    another. Once the mechanism under the first proviso is set into motion and

    the various stages are complied with, the only possible manner in which the

    mechanism prescribed under the first proviso can conclude is by the

    Governor granting assent to the bill. Thus, there is no scope for the Governor

    to reserve a bill for the consideration of the President once it is presented to

    him for reconsideration after compliance with the procedure
laid down in
the first proviso.
206. We say so because the procedure
laid down in
the first proviso cannot be

     construed as giving the State legislature the unfettered power to introduce

     changes to the bill which alter its very nature, or which, for instance, fall

     foul of the second proviso to
Article 200.
In such a scenario, the Governor

     would have all the three options which are available to him when a bill is

     presented to him in the first instance. However, whenever the House or

     Houses reconsider the bill “accordingly”, that is, in accordance with the

     suggestions of the Governor and pass it with or without amendments, the

     Governor is bound to act as per the clear constitutional directive
laid down

     in
the first proviso.
213. The petitioner also placed reliance on the recommendations made by the

     Sarkaria Commission and the Punchhi Commission to argue that the Court

     should read in some time-limit into the scheme of Article(s) 200 and
201
respectively to prevent inaction on the part of the Governor and the

     President.
216. However, unlike many countries across the globe wherein a provision for

    deemed assent upon the expiry of the specified time period has been made,

    there is no such provision in our Constitution. The only manner in which a

    temporal imperative has been weaved into the scheme of
Article 200
is by

    the use of the expression “as soon as possible” in the first proviso. The said

    expression, which also appears in
Article 111
of the Constitution, was the

    subject of some debate in the Constituent Assembly.
217.
Article 111
, which provides for the President’s assent to bills passed by

    Parliament was originally numbered as
Article 91
under the Draft

    Constitution and it provided a time-limit of six-weeks to the President to

    send back the bill to the House(s) for reconsideration. The Draft article read

    as follows:
218. During the Constituent Assembly debates, Dr. B.R. Ambedkar moved an

    amendment to substitute the expression “not later than six weeks” with “as

    soon as possible”. Further in the debate, Shri Naziruddin Ahmad advocated

    for a change in the aforesaid amendment and sought to substitute the term

    “as soon as possible” with “as soon as may be”. His contention rested on

    the reasoning that the phrase, “as soon as possible” which was introduced

    by Dr. Ambedkar in his amendment in place of the original wording used in
Article 91
, that is, “not later than six weeks”, imposed an unduly stringent
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 177 of 414
obligation upon the President. He was of the opinion that “as soon as

        possible” mandates immediate action, thereby curtailing the President’s

        scope to engage in a careful and deliberate review of the bill presented for

        assent. He expressed concern that such a rigid constraint could give rise to

        hasty decisions, devoid of any careful examination of the presented bill. In

        his view, the formulation ran the risk of undermining the quality of the

        President’s judgment under
Article 111.
He expressed his opinion as

        follows:
219. To avoid the aforesaid possibilities, Shri Naziruddin Ahmad proposed the

        adoption of “as soon as may be”, which he interpreted to mean “as soon as

        is reasonably practicable”. In his opinion, this change would allow the

        President greater flexibility and sufficient time to thoroughly examine the

        provisions of the bill presented to him. Such freedom would prove

        particularly valuable when the President contemplates returning the bill to

the House(s) for reconsideration, especially in circumstances where

    amendments might be recommended. The essence of Shri Ahmad’s

    amendment was to safeguard the President’s ability to render well-reasoned

    and thoughtful decisions without any rigid time constraints.
222. In light of the debate which took place on 20 th May 1949, the proposed

        amendment to
Article 91
was adopted by the Assembly, thereby substituting

        the expression “not later than six weeks” with “as soon as possible” and the

        same came to be added to the Constitution.

Article 91
reflects a sense of

     inherent trust reposed by the Constituent Assembly that the President would

     execute his functions as enshrined under

     timely and efficient manner.

up to the personal freedom of an individual. Sub-articles (1)
        and (2) refer to the protection against arrest and detention of
        a person under the ordinary law. Persons arrested or
        detained under a law providing for preventive detention are
        dealt with in sub-articles (4) to (7). Sub-article (5) says that
        when a person is detained in pursuance of an order under a
        law providing for preventive detention the grounds on which
        the order is made have to be communicated to the person
        concerned as soon as may be and he has to be afforded
        earliest opportunity to represent against the order. The
        object of communicating the grounds is to enable the detenu
        to make his representation against the order. The words “as
        soon as may be” in the context must imply anxious care on
        the part of the authority concerned to perform its duty in this
        respect as early as practicable without avoidable delay.

Similarly, when the representation is made it is in the fitness
            of things that the said representation should be considered
            with the same sense of urgency with which the grounds are
            intended to be communicated to the detenu. That is the only
            way in which the purpose, for which the earliest
            communication of the grounds to the person concerned is
            provided, can be achieved. The representation must,
            therefore, be considered with due promptitude or expedition
            and without avoidable delay, in other words with reasonable
            dispatch. As held by this Court in Jayanarayan case, the
            representation should be considered as expeditiously as
            possible. As the question of delay in considering the
            representation falls for determination on the facts and
            circumstances of each case the binding force of a past
            precedent for a later case would largely depend on the degree
            of close similarity of the circumstances dealt with therein.

          read as under:
Wherever the Constitution requires the
                 satisfaction of the President or the Governor

                 satisfaction required by the Constitution is not
                 the personal satisfaction of the President or of
                 the Governor but is the satisfaction of the

President or of the Governor in the
                 constitutional sense under the Cabinet system
                 of Government. It is the satisfaction of the
                 Council of Ministers on whose aid and advice
                 the President or the Governor generally
                 exercises all his powers and functions.
21. Even though the Governor may be
                 authorised to exercise some functions, under
                 different provisions of the Constitution, the
                 same are required to be exercised only on the
                 basis of the aid and advice tendered to him

Article 163
, unless the Governor has

                 function concerned, in his own discretion.”
(ii)   Secondly, it observed that the law is clear and explicit – the advice

       of the State Cabinet is binding on the Governor when it comes to the

       exercise of powers under
Article 161.
In the absence of any other

       provision under the Constitution or any statute in this regard, the

       Governor could not have deviated from the binding recommendations

       of the State Cabinet and referred the mercy petition to the President.

       It was held that such an action is contrary to the constitutional scheme.

       The relevant observations read as under:
exercise of these powers, such as, under
Article 161

        ground for the exercise of judicial review as the said provision

        pertains to the liberty of individuals and any inexplicable delay not on

account of the prisoners, is inexcusable. The relevant observations

      read as under:
On the contrary, it only reinforces the sense of expediency and urgency that

     has been time and again emphasized since the adoption of the Constitution.

     The reason why the prescription of a time-limit does not tantamount to an

     alteration or amendment is because the time-limit that is being prescribed by

     cannot be understood to be a hanging sword on the Governor whereby even

     an unavoidable non-compliance would automatically ensue consequences of

     ‘assent’. The nature of such prescription is quite different which may be

     better explained through the concept of judicial review.
239. Any time-limit in the exercise of powers in terms of
Article 200
of the

    Constitution should not be construed as timelines laid within the edifice of

    the provision, rather should be understood as timelines that would serve as

    a lodestar for the purpose of exercise of judicial review by the courts, a

    benchmark tool to aid and enable the courts in ascertaining if any inaction

    or malfeasance has occasioned in the exercise of such powers. These

    timelines no doubt demand the earnest adherence by the Governor, however,

    these being nothing more than tools upon which scrutiny by judicial review

    is to be premised, remain as prescriptions within the realm of judicial review

    alone and do not transgress into the legislative bounds or amount to

    alteration of the text or authority of
Article 200
of the Constitution. The

    reason why these time-lines do not immolate the very fabric of
Article 200
is because the said provision even with the infusion of these time-limit still

remains markedly different from its counterpart provisions where such time-
limits are legislatively prescribed. For instance,
Article 75
of the

     Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan or Article I,
Section 7
of

     the U.S. Constitution, where if no decision is taken within the stipulated

     time-limit by the President then the bills are deemed to have been assented

     to.
240. Thus, it is important to take note of this very fine but pertinent distinction

     that the prescription of a time-limit by this Court into
Article 200
of the

     Constitution does not fundamentally change the procedure which has been

     envisaged. While the reading in of a time-limit under
Article 200
would have

     meant that there would be deemed assent upon failure of the Governor to

     comply with the said timeline, the prescription of a reasonable time period

     does not introduce any such mechanism or deeming fiction in
Article 200.
244. While the reading in of an absolute time-limit would have left the Governor

     with no choice but to comply with it, the prescription of the judicially

     evolved time-limits by us leaves it open for the Governor to justify the delay

     caused by providing reasonable grounds. Delay caused by the Governor

     beyond the prescribed time-limits would be justiciable and the courts, with

     deference to applicable judicial principles, would be fully competent to

ascertain whether the delayed exercise of power by the Governor under
Article 200
was based on any reasonable grounds or not.
251. Failure to comply with the timelines prescribed above would make the

      inaction on part of the Governor amenable to judicial review. We shall also

      deal with the necessity of expeditiously disposing of the references under
Article 201
by the President in subsequent parts of this judgment.



iv.    Whether the Governor in the exercise of his powers under
Article 200
of the Constitution can only act in accordance with the aid and advice
       tendered to him by the State Council of Ministers?
252. Significant time was spent during the course of the arguments on the key

      issue of the scope of discretion enjoyed by the Governor in exercise of his

      powers under
Article 200
, more particularly, as regards the reservation of

      bills for the consideration of the President.
Chelmsford Reforms of 1919, which culminated into the GoI Act, 1919,

     marked the early stirrings of responsible government, albeit in a nascent

     form. Despite this shift, the Governor remained central to the provincial

     administration,     continuing      to     wield     significant     authority.
261. The declaration      of Independence brought        about    a fundamental

     transformation in the role of the Governor. Until the Constitution came into

     effect, the provisions of the GoI Act, 1935, as modified by the India

     (Provisional Constitution) Order, 1947 (for short, the “Adaptation Order”),

     governed the administration of the country. Significantly, the Adaptation

     Order omitted the expressions ‘in his discretion’, ‘acting in his discretion’,

     and ‘exercising his individual judgment’ from the Act, signaling a departure

     from the colonial framework.
b.        Constituent Assembly Debates on the mode of Selection of the
          Governor

elaborated on the potential tussle that would ensue between an elected

        Governor and the Chief Minister of the State as follows:
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                             Page 224 of 414
between an elected Governor and the Chief Minister or Premier, which could

        disrupt governance. Apart from the very real possibility of conflicts between

        the elected Governor and the Chief Minister which necessitated appointment

        via nomination, he argued, on the other hand that, if there was no conflict

        and there was perfect agreement or collusion between the Governor and the

        Chief Minister, they could agree in defying the Centre altogether and that

        would put the Centre in a precarious position where they would be

        completely blocked out from the States. Therefore, he remarked that, “But

        apart from the conflict, if there is no conflict and there is perfect agreement,

        if these two gentlemen set the Centre at naught, what will be the position?”18.

        Hence, in his opinion, the appointment of Governors by the President would

        maintain a balance of power and ensure some degree of Central influence

        over provincial matters. He further suggested that Governors should serve

        at the pleasure of the President, thereby eliminating the need for

        impeachment provisions and also reinforcing the oversight of the Centre.
270. Shri. Hriday Nath Kunzru highlighted the potential for friction between

        Governors and their Cabinets, specifically with reference to
Article 175
of

        the Draft Constitution, which has now been adopted as
Article 200.
By

        drawing comparisons to the Canadian model, he argued that empowering

the parliamentary system of democracy and strengthen the relationship

     between the provinces and the Centre.
c.    Constituent Assembly Debates on the Exercise of Discretion by the
      Governor
272. The other key question which fell for the consideration of the Constituent

     Assembly was whether any discretion would be made available to the

     Governor as the constitutional head of the State.
Article 163(1)
of the

     Constitution, which describes the nature of such discretionary powers, reads

     as follows:
273. To understand the true import and the scope of this discretion which exists

     with the Governor, it would be apposite for us to look into the Constituent

     Assembly debates pertaining to this Article in some detail.
Article 163
which

     provides for the Council of Ministers to aid and advice the Governor was

     earlier numbered as
Article 143
under the Draft Constitution. Two

     amendments were sought to be moved to draft
Article 143
on the 1st of July

     1949; however, those did not gain the approval of the Constituent Assembly
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 227 of 414
and the original version of draft
Article 143
came to be later adopted as
Article 163
as we see it today.
274. Of the two amendments, one of which was moved by Shri. H.V. Kamath

        sought to delete the expression, “except in so far as he is by or under this

        Constitution required to exercise his functions or any of them in his

        discretion”. Shri. H.V. Kamath was of the opinion that the draft Article had

        been blindly copied from the GoI Act, 1935, without any mature

        consideration. He further remarked that, “There is no strong or valid reason

        for giving the Governor more authority either in his discretion or otherwise

        vis-a-vis his ministers, than has been given to the President in relation to his

        ministers”20. Investing such wide discretionary powers on the Governor was

        all the more problematic, according to him, since Governors are nominated

        to their positions and not elected. No departure from the principles of a

        constitutional government must be favored except for reasons of emergency

        and therefore, he advocated for these discretionary powers to be done away

        with.
276. As an illustration, Shri. T.T. Krishnamachari referred to draft
Article 188
which related to the proclamation of Emergency in States by the Governor

        under his discretion. It was his opinion that if such a discretionary power can

        be given under draft
Article 188
, there is no harm in the mention of

        discretion under draft
Article 143
either. He understood the scheme of the

        draft Constitution to mean that unless there is a specific mention of

discretion under any subsequent Article, the discretionary power mentioned

        under draft
Article 143
cannot at all be exercised.
279. Shri. B.M. Gupta was of the view that if certain powers had to be given to

    the Governor, our endeavor must be to restrict them as far as possible so that

    the Governor’s position as a constitutional head may be maintained.
284. While concluding the debate on draft
Article 143
, Dr. B. R. Ambedkar

        elaborated that the main and crucial question under this draft Article was

        whether the Governor must have certain discretionary powers or not. During

        the course of the debate, it was pointed out that the retention of discretionary

        powers in the Governor was contrary to responsible government in the

        States/provinces. It was also stated that the same mimicked the GoI Act,

        1935, which was largely assailed as being undemocratic. However, Dr. B.

        R. Ambedkar was of the undoubted view that “the retention in or the vesting

the Governor with certain discretionary powers is in no sense contrary to or

        in no sense a negation of responsible government.”27 He cited Section 55 of

        the Canadian Constitution which read as follows:
286. Now moving on to how an Article providing for a certain amount of

    discretionary powers to the Governor is to be framed, Dr. B. R. Ambedkar

    elaborated that there are several ways in which the same can be done. One

    way could be to omit the words from draft
Article 143
and to add to draft
Articles 175 (presently
Article 200
)
, 188
, or such other provisions, an

    express mention which vests the Governor with discretionary power. Those

    Articles would then mention that notwithstanding draft
Article 143
, the

    Governor would have a certain discretionary power. Another way would be

    to state in draft
Article 143
itself that “except as provided in draft
Articles

    175
, 188
etc.”, the Governor shall act in accordance with the aid and advice

    of the Council of Ministers with the Chief Minister at the head. However,

    irrespective of what method of drafting is adopted, the essential point that

    would remain is that the Governor’s discretionary power must be

    acknowledged in some form.
288. While acknowledging that there exists a material difference between draft
Article 61(1) (Article 74
(1) as it stands today) relating to the executive

    functions of the President vis-à-vis his Ministers and the draft
Article 143
,

    Dr. B. R. Ambedkar elucidated that it was not the intention of the drafters to

    vest any discretionary power upon the President. It is because the provincial

    governments are required to work in subordination to the Central

    government and in order to ensure that they do act in such subordination, the

    Governor would reserve certain matters, thereby giving the President an

    opportunity to see that they are broadly in compliance with the policy of the

    Central government. Through this mechanism, the President would be able
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 238 of 414
to ensure that the rules under which the provincial governments are

    supposed to act, according to the Constitution, are observed. Therefore, the

    vesting of discretionary powers in the post of the Governor was considered

    crucial to enable this administrative dialogue between the Centre and the

    provinces.
The founding fathers deliberately avoided election to the
        office of the Governor, as is in vogue in the USA to insulate
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 241 of 414
the office from linguistic chauvinism. The President has been
        empowered to appoint him as executive head of the State
        under
Article 155
in Part VI, Chapter II. The executive power
        of the State is vested in him by
Article 154
and exercised by
        him with the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers, the
        Chief Minister as its head. Under
Article 159
the Governor
        shall discharge his functions in accordance with the oath to
        protect and defend the Constitution and the law. The office of
        the Governor, therefore, is intended to ensure protection and
        sustenance of the constitutional process of the working of the
        Constitution by the elected executive and giving him an
        umpire's role. When a Gandhian economist member of the
        Constituent Assembly wrote a letter to Gandhiji of his plea
        for abolition of the office of the Governor, Gandhiji wrote to
        him for its retention; thus, the Governor had been given a
        very useful and necessary place in the scheme of the team. He
        would be an arbiter when there was a constitutional deadlock
        in the State and he would be able to play an impartial role.
        There would be administrative mechanism through which the
        constitutional crisis would be resolved in the State. The
        Governor thus should play an important role. In his dual
        undivided capacity as head of the State he should impartially
        assist the President. As a constitutional head of the State
        Government in times of constitutional crisis he should bring
        about sobriety. The link is apparent when we find that
Article
        356
would be put into operation normally based on the
        Governor's report. He should truthfully and with high degree
        of constitutional responsibility, in terms of his oath, inform
        the President that a situation has arisen in which the
        constitutional machinery in the State has failed and the
        Government of the State cannot be carried on in accordance
        with the provisions of the Constitution, with necessary
        detailed factual foundation.”
                                           (Emphasis supplied)
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                     Page 242 of 414
To illustrate,
Article 239(2)
states that where a Governor is
        appointed an administrator of an adjoining Union territory
        he shall exercise his functions as such administrator
        independently of his Council of Ministers. The other articles
        which speak of the discretion of the Governor are paragraphs
        9(2) and 18(3) of the Sixth Schedule and
Articles 371-A(1)(b)
,
        371-A(1)(d)
and
371-A(2)(b)
and
371-A(2)(f).
The discretion
        conferred on the Governor means that as the constitutional
        or formal head of the State the power is vested in him. In this
        connection, reference may be made to
Article 356
which
        states that the Governor can send a report to the President
        that a situation has arisen in which the government of the
        State cannot be carried on in accordance with the provisions
        of this Constitution. Again
Article 200
requires the Governor
        to reserve for consideration any Bill which in his opinion if it
        became law, would so derogate from the powers of the High
        Court as to endanger the position which the High Court is
        designed to fill under the Constitution.
controlled by the Union Ministry which is answerable to
        Parliament for those actions. Again, a minimal area
        centering round reports to be despatched under
Article 356
may not, in the nature of things, be amenable to Ministerial
        advice. The practice of sending periodical reports to the
        Union Government is a pre-constitutional one and it is
        doubtful if a Governor could or should report behind the back
        of his Ministers. For a Centrally appointed constitutional
        functionary to keep a dossier on his Ministers or to report
        against them or to take up public stances critical of
        Government policy settled by the Cabinet or to interfere in
        the administration directly — these are unconstitutional faux
        pas and run counter to Parliamentary system. In all his
        constitutional ‘functions’ it is the Ministers who act; only in
        the narrow area specifically marked out for discretionary
        exercise by the Constitution, he is untramelled by the State
        Ministers' acts and advice. Of course, a limited free-wheeling
        is available regarding choice of Chief Minister and dismissal
        of the Ministry, as in the English practice adapted to Indian
        conditions.
constitutional authority. This position is not acceptable
        because an examination of the executive and legislative
        functions of the Governor, from the surrounding provisions
        of the Constitution clearly brings out that the Governor has
        not been assigned any significant role either in the executive
        or the legislative functioning of the State. The position
        adopted on behalf of the appellants, on the other hand,
        augurs well in an overall harmonious construction of the
        provisions of the Constitution. Even on a cursory
        examination of the relevant provisions of the Constitution, we
        are inclined to accept the contention advanced on behalf of
        the appellants.
Significantly, with reference to the Governor's discretionary
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 258 of 414
powers, it was emphasised by Dr B.R. Ambedkar, that: (CAD
        Vol. 8, p. 501)

             “The Hon'ble Dr B.R. Ambedkar.— … The clause
             is a very limited clause; it says: ‘except insofar as
             he is by or under this Constitution’. Therefore,
Article 163
will have to be read in conjunction with
             such other articles which specifically reserve the
             power to the Governor. It is not a general clause
             giving the Governor power to disregard the advice
             of his Ministers, in any matter in which he finds he
             ought to disregard. There, I think, lies the fallacy
             of the argument of my Hon'ble friend ….”

        In our considered view, the Constituent Assembly Debates
        leave no room for any doubt that the Framers of the
        Constitution desired to embody the general and basic
        principle, describing the extent and scope of the discretionary
        power of the Governor, in clause (1) of
Article 163
, and not
        in clause (2) thereof, as suggested by the learned counsel for
        the respondents.
308. However, once the bill is passed by the State legislature, and presented to

     the Governor for assent, he must act on the aid and advice of the Council of

     Ministers as a general rule and only in exceptional situations which have

     been illustrated in paragraph 300 of this judgment, should he reserve it for

     the consideration of the President. A look at Rule 48 of the Tamil Nadu

     Government Business Rules, 1978 makes it clear that once a draft bill is

     approved by the Minister-in-Charge, a copy of it is supplied to the Governor.

     Rule 48 reads thus:
309. After circulation of the bill to the Governor, any suggestions made by the

     Governor may be looked into and incorporated. Thereafter, a final copy of

     the bill as approved by the Law Department is also circulated to the

     Governor. Rule 51(b) which provides for it reads thus:
312. What also needs to be remembered is that whenever a provision of the

    Constitution prescribes for the assent of the President for the purpose of

    enforceability or securing immunity, any State government would, in all

    likelihood, advice the Governor to reserve the bill for the consideration of

    the President. Even the Tamil Nadu Government Business Rules, 1978

    prescribe the procedure for pre-consultation with the Central government

    whenever a subject-matter falling in the Concurrent list or certain other

    constitutional provision, is being legislated upon. As we have also discussed,

    the position settled by Kaiser-I-Hind (supra) is that the reference to the

    President needs to be detailed and specific so as to enable him to undertake

    an effective “consideration” of the reserved bill. In the practical working of

    a Cabinet form of government, it is the Council of Ministers who would be

    best equipped to make such detailed references to the President, and the

    Governor would act as the bridge connecting the two. It is only in rare cases,

    where in spite of the evident requirement for the President’s assent in order

    to make the bill effective as an Act (as observed in paragraph 86 of Hoecsht

    (supra)), the Council of Ministers has failed to advice the Governor to

    reserve the bill for the President, should the Governor decide to reserve the

    bill on his own motion.
316. The deletion of the words “in his discretion” from Section 75 of the GoI Act,

     1935 before adapting it as
Article 200
of the Constitution must be

     understood in the right context. The GoI Act, 1919 introduced an element of

     provincial autonomy in the administration of the country, however, the

     Governor remained at the center of administration having reserve as well as

     emergency powers. With the advent of the GoI Act, 1935, the dyarchy at the

     provincial level was abolished, but the Governor, as the agent of the British

     Crown, continued to have the discretion to veto any legislation passed by

     the provincial legislature. The Governor could also in his discretion reserve

     any bill for the consideration of the Governor-General. This power of the

     Governor was to be essentially exercised in accordance with the directions

     of the Governor-General. However, with the dawn of independence, and the

     framing of the Constitution, the model of governance which was adopted

     allowed the States to be supreme in their respective fields, with certain

     powers having been reserved for the Union to ensure the integrity of the

     nation and uniformity of policy in certain key areas. The Governor was no

     more required to have an all-pervasive control over the State and their

     responsibility towards the Union was to the extent of ensuring that the

     administration in the State was being done in conformity with the principles
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                     Page 277 of 414
enshrined in the Constitution. It is in this context that the power of the

    Governor to submit a report to the President under
Article 356
and also the

    power under
Article 200
to reserve a bill for the consideration of the

    President, is to be understood.
318. Thus, we are of the view that the Governor does not possess any discretion

    in the exercise of his functions under
Article 200
and has to mandatorily

    abide by the advice tendered to him by the Council of Ministers. The only

    exceptions to this general rule are as follows:
320. We have extensively discussed in the preceding section that the Governor

     under the scheme of
Article 200
would, as a general rule, be expected to act

     on the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers as provided for under
Article 163(1).
The deletion of the expression “in his discretion” by the

     framers of the Constitution during the course of adapting Section 75 of the

     GoI Act, 1935 into
Article 200
, is a clear indication of their intent to make

     the ordinary exercise of powers of the Governor under
Article 200
subject

     to the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers. However, the aforesaid

     ordinary exercise of power by the Governor is subject to certain exceptions
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                     Page 280 of 414
where the Governor may act in his own discretion, contrary to the advice of

the Council of Ministers. There are two broad circumstances under which it

would be permissible for the Governor to act in his own discretion under
Article 200:
(ii) Secondly, whether the withholding of assent by the President under
Article 201
of the Constitution, could also be said to be beyond the

           scope of judicial scrutiny?
333. It could be argued that the decision taken by the Governor under
Article 200
would be shielded from the scrutiny of the courts by virtue of the immunity

     accorded under
Article 361
of the Constitution. However, in this regard, we

     may only refer to the observations made by this Court in
Rameshwar Prasad
(supra) which leaves no doubt that the immunity enshrined in
Article 361
of

     the Constitution does not preclude or prohibit the courts in any manner from

     looking into the actions of the Governor which by necessary implication

     would include his actions under
Article 200
as well. The relevant

     observations are as follows:
343. The aforesaid observations would indicate that the grant of assent by the

     President to a State legislation falling under
Article 31A
was held to be non-

     justiciable only on the ground that the first proviso to
Article 31A
confers

     the power on the President to take a decision as regards whether assent is to

     be granted or not.
In reply to these averments in the petitions the Under
        Secretary to the Government of Gujarat, Education
        Department has stated in his counter-affidavit that the Bill
        was presented to the Governor of Gujarat after it was passed
        by the Assembly. The Governor of Gujarat reserved the Bill
        for the consideration of the President under
Article 200
of the
        Constitution since he felt that in view of clause 33 of the Bill
        which provided for taking over of the management of a school
        for a limited period in public interest it was necessary to
        reserve the Bill for the consideration of the President.
        Accordingly the Bill was referred to the President. At the
        meeting held in the Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of
        India on August 3, 1973 to discuss the Bill it was suggested
        by the representatives of the Central Government that the
        provisions of the Bill which did not exclude institutions
        established or administered by the minorities from their
        scope were repugnant to
Article 30
of the Constitution and
        therefore the Bill should be suitably amended. It was also
        suggested to the representatives of the State Government that
        it would be better to carry out the requisite amendments by
        promulgating an ordinance. Accordingly the draft of the
        ordinance which was ultimately promulgated as Ordinance 6
        of 1973 was forwarded for the instructions of the President
        under
Article 213(1)
of the Constitution. Thereafter the draft
        of the Ordinance and the Bill were both considered by the
        President and he assented to the said Bill and issued
        instructions as required by the proviso to
Article 213
of the
        Constitution for the promulgation of the said Ordinance on
        September 28, 1973. Accordingly the said Bill became law on
        its publication on the very same day. The Ordinance was
        issued on September 29, 1973. In the circumstances it cannot
        be said that the assent which was given by the President was
        conditional. The records relating to the above proceedings
        were also made available to the court. On going through the
        material placed before us we are satisfied that the President
        had given assent to the Act and it is not correct to say that it
        was a qualified assent.
The Act
which was duly published in
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 309 of 414
the official Gazette contains the recital that the said Act had
            received the assent of the President on September 28, 1973.
            Moreover questions relating to the fact whether assent is
            given by the Governor or the President cannot be agitated
            also in this manner. [...]”
                                              (Emphasis supplied)
73. The above decisions essentially answer the submissions
            which were urged by Dr Dhavan. The law as propounded in
            the line of precedents adverted to above must negate the
            submissions which were urged on behalf of the petitioners.
            Once the Bill (which led to the Reservation Act, 2018) was
            reserved by the Governor for the consideration of the
            President, it was for the President to either grant or withhold
            assent to the Bill. The President having assented to the Bill,
            the requirements of
Article 201
were fulfilled. The validity of
            the assent by the President is non-justiciable. [...]”

                                              (Emphasis supplied)
350. The Constitution Bench in Kaiser-I-Hind (supra) had the occasion to

     consider in detail whether the assent of the President sought with regard to

     a State law would be limited only to the repugnancy of the laws to which the

     attention of the President was drawn to whilst seeking his assent or would

     such assent be qua all other laws enacted by the Parliament to which the

     State law in question may also be repugnant to. In other words, whether the

     assent granted by the President to a State legislation would be deemed to be

     an assent qua all earlier enactments made by the Parliament on the subject.

     This Court whilst answering the aforesaid question in the negative, held that

     the “consideration” by the President and his “assent” under
Article 254(2)
is limited to the proposal made by the State government and, the State

     legislation would prevail only qua the laws for which repugnancy was

     pointed out and the “assent” of the President was sought for. The Court,

     inter alia, held that the words “reserved for consideration” indicate the
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                     Page 313 of 414
requirement of an active application of mind by the President to the

     repugnancy pointed out between the proposed State law and the earlier law

     made by the Parliament and the necessity of having such a law in the State,

     keeping in mind the peculiar facts, the attending circumstances and the

     backdrop in which such law was made by the State government. Similarly,

     the word “consideration” indicates the requirement of careful thinking and

     due application of mind regarding the necessity of having a State law which

     is repugnant to the law(s) made by the Parliament. Lastly, the term “assent”

     implies an expressed agreement of mind to what is proposed by the State

     i.e., knowledge of the President as to the repugnancy between the State law

     and the earlier law(s) made by Parliament on the same subject-matter, as

     well as agreement to the reason and attending circumstances, regarding the

     necessity of having such State law.
Necessarily, in the quasi-federal structure adopted for the
        nation, predominance is given to the law made by Parliament
        and in such circumstances only the State law which secured
        the assent of the President under clause (2) of
Article 254
comes to be protected, subject of course to the powers of
        Parliament under the proviso to the said clause. Therefore,
        the President has to be apprised of the reasons at least as to
        why his assent is being sought, the need or necessity and the
        justification or otherwise for claiming predominance for the
        State law concerned. This itself would postulate an
        obligation, inherent in the scheme underlying as well as the
        very purpose and object of seeking the assent under clause
        (2) of
Article 254
, to enumerate or specify and illustrate the
        particular Central law or provision with reference to which
        the predominance is desired. The absence of any
        standardized or stipulated form in which it is to be sought for,
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 317 of 414
should not detract the State concerned, to disown its
        obligation to be precise and specific in the extent of
        protection sought having regard to the serious consequences
        which thereby inevitably follow i.e. the substitution of the
        Union law in force by the State law, in the territorial limits of
        the State concerned, with drastic alteration or change in the
        rights of citizen, which it may, thereby bring about.
76. Different provisions of the Constitution envisage the
        grant of assent by the President as well as the Governor of a
        State.
Article 111
provides for the assent of the President to
        a Bill passed by the Houses of Parliament, in the same
        manner in which
Article 200
empowers the Governor of a
        State in respect of a Bill passed by the Legislative Assembly
        or by the Houses of the legislature where there is a
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 321 of 414
Legislative Council in addition to the Assembly. Parliament
        for the Union consists of the President and two Houses as the
        legislature of States consists of the Governor and the House
        or Houses, as the case may be (vide
Articles 79
and
168
). The
        policy-making executive power of the Union also vests with
        the President, as the executive power of the State vests with
        the Governor, and those powers have to be exercised with the
        aid and advice of the Council of Ministers, for the Union
        headed by the Prime Minister and for the State to be headed
        by the Chief Minister. The President or the Governor, as the
        case may be, as and when a Bill after having been passed is
        presented, may accord assent or as soon as possible
        thereafter return the Bill to the Houses with a message
        requesting to reconsider the Bill or any provisions thereof,
        including the introduction of any amendment as
        recommended in his message and if thereafter the Houses on
        reconsideration of the Bill, pass the Bill again with or without
        amendment and present the same for the assent, the
        President/Governor, as the case may be, shall not withhold
        his assent. Being an exercise pertaining to expression of
        political will, apparently, the will of the people expressed
        through the legislation passed by their elected
        representatives is given prominence by specifically providing
        for a compulsory consent or assent. The same could not be
        said with reference to the “assent” of the President envisaged
        under
Articles 31-A
, 31-C
, 254(2)
and
304(b)
of the
        Constitution. In my view, the “assent” envisaged in these
        articles by the very nature and character of the powers
        conferred constitute a distinct class and category of their
        own, different from the normal “assent” envisaged under
Articles 111
of the President or
Article 200
of the Governor.
Article 201
also would indicate that even when for the second
        time the Houses of the State Legislature pass the Bill and
        present for “consideration”, there is no compulsion for the
        President to accord assent. Therefore, the reservation of any
        Bill/Act for the “consideration” of the President for
        according his assent, keeping in view, also the avowed object
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 322 of 414
envisaged under
Article 254(2)
, renders it qualitatively
        different from the ordinary assent to be given by the President
        to a Bill passed by Parliament or that of the Governor to a
        Bill passed by the legislature(s) of the State concerned.
353. It is pertinent to note that it was observed by Doraiswamy, J., that the assent

     of the President under
Article 254(2)
is not of the same nature as the assent

     of the President or the Governor under
Article 111
and
200
of the

     Constitution respectively. He placed strong emphasis on the use of the

     expression “consideration” in
Article 254(2)
to hold that such a

     consideration by the President would be meaningless in the absence of a

     clear and specific reference made to him pointing out the repugnancy

     between the Central law and the proposed State law.
354. While the observations made in Kaiser-I-Hind (supra) as regards the import

     of the expression “consideration” were in the context of
Article 254(2)
, the
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 324 of 414
same would apply to every bill reserved for the consideration of the

    President under
Article 201
as the expression “consideration” finds a

    mention in
Article 201
as well. Thus, the reservation for the consideration

    of the President must be accompanied by a reference which contains specific

    details as regards the purpose why the consideration of the President is

    sought.
363. The observations in the aforesaid decisions as regards the non-justiciability

     of the assent of the President under
Article 201
cannot be construed to mean

     that the withholding of assent and reservation of bills by the Governor under
Article 200
, as well as withholding of assent by the President under
Article

     201
are beyond the scope of judicial review. The observations of non-

     justiciability of assent of the President under
Article 201
can be explained

     in light of the assent under
Article 201
being predominantly a matter of

     federal policy of the Union government. On certain subject matters

     prescribed in various provisions of the Constitution, and on subject matters

     falling in the Concurrent List, the Constitution has accorded primacy to the

     Centre over the States. On issues of repugnancy, for illustration, it is only

     on the approval of the President, that a State law which is repugnant to a

     Central legislation can become enforceable. No obligation is placed on the

     President to grant assent under
Article 201
and it is to be decided by the

     President on the aid and advice of the Union Council for Ministers. It is in

     view of this position and for the limited extent of judicially manageable

     standards of evaluation that the assent under
Article 201
has been described

     as non-justiciable.
364. However, the same is not the case when the courts have to consider the

     withholding of assent or reservation of bills by the Governor under Article
365. The discharge of functions by the President under
Article 201
stands on a

    different footing than that of the Governor under
Article 200.
While there is

    no political hue to the limited discretion conferred upon the Governor under
Article 200
, and any exercise of such discretion has to be solely on

    constitutional grounds, the grant of assent under
Article 201
has an element

    of political hue by virtue of the fact that the President under
Article 201
has

    been given the prerogative to decide whether the grant of assent in certain

    cases would be desirable or not. However, at the same time, what must be

    remembered is that it is only in those areas where the primacy has been given
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 331 of 414
to the Union would this political consideration be permissible. Additionally,

     this political hue is not owing to the difference in opinion or political views

     of the governments at the Centre and the State but is attributable to the

     desirability of vesting the Union government to exercise certain discretion

     in matters pertaining to broader issues where uniformity in national policy

     may be desirable. In such a case, the scope of justiciability under
Article 201
would be limited to questions of arbitrariness, malafides and inaction.
367. We summarise our findings on the judicial review of the exercise of power

    by the Governor under
Article 200
and by the President under
Article 201
of the Constitution as follows:
Hind (supra). Such a reservation can be assailed by the State

             Government, if the reference made by the Governor either fails

             to indicate the reasons for such reservation as discussed above

             or that the reasons indicated are wholly irrelevant, mala-fide,

             arbitrary,     unnecessary   or   motivated     by    extraneous

             considerations. Then such a reservation would be liable to be

             set aside. This question being purely of a legal nature would be

             completely justiciable and the competent court would be after

             a proper adjudication fully authorized to approve or disapprove

             of such reservation by the Governor. If such a challenge finds

             favour with the competent court, then, subject to any other

             considerations, it would be fit case for issuance of a writ in the

             nature of mandamus to the Governor for appropriate action. If

             however, the challenge should fail then the mechanism

             envisaged under
Article 201
of the Constitution will spring into

             action.
368. We summarise our findings on the judicial review of the exercise of power

    by the President under Article 201in withholding assent to a bill as follows:
370. As we have discussed,
Article 200
provides three courses of action to the

      Governor when a bill is presented to him - to assent, to withhold assent or to

      reserve the bill for the consideration of the President. If he declares assent,

      then the bill becomes an Act of the State legislature. If he withholds assent,

      then the procedure prescribed under the first proviso springs into motion.

      However, the procedure which is to be followed once a bill is reserved for

      the consideration of the President is provided in
Article 201
of the

      Constitution.
Article 201
was adopted without any debate in the Constituent

      Assembly on 01st August, 1949. It reads as follows:
371. A plain reading of
Article 201
indicates that once a bill is reserved by the

     Governor for the consideration of the President, the President has two

     options to choose from - he may either assent to the bill, which would bring

     the legislative process to a conclusion and the bill would become an act, or

     he may withhold his assent to the bill.
372. The proviso to
Article 201
provides that in case of bills other than money

     bills, the President may direct the Governor to return the bill to the State

     legislature together with a message as is mentioned in the first proviso to
Article 200.
Once the bill is so returned, the State legislature is required to

     reconsider the bill in light of the suggestions of the President within a period

     of six months and if the Bill is passed again, with or without amendments,

     it shall be presented again to the President for his consideration.
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 341 of 414
373. There are some features of
Article 201
which are markedly different from
Articles 111
and
200.
The proviso to
Article 111
as well as the first proviso

    to
Article 200
mandate the President and the Governor respectively to assent

    to a bill which has been reconsidered by the Parliament and State legislature

    respectively and presented to them for the second time. However, the

    proviso to
Article 201
does not place any such obligation on the President

    to mandatorily accord assent to a bill which is placed before him after

    reconsideration by the State legislature. This is evident from the absence of

    the expression “shall not withhold assent therefrom” in the proviso to Article
201. This is also brought out from the difference between the language

    employed in
Articles 111
and
200
vis-a-vis that employed in
Article 201.
The first proviso to
Article 111
uses the expression “and if the Bill is passed

    again by the Houses with or without amendment and presented to the

    President for assent”. Similarly, the first proviso to
Article 200
also uses the

    expression “and if the Bill is passed again by the House or Houses with or

    without amendment and presented to the Governor for assent”. However,

    the proviso to
Article 201
uses the expression “and, if it is again passed by

    the House or Houses with or without amendment, it shall be presented again

    to the President for his consideration”. Instead of the expression “for

    assent”, the proviso to
Article 201
uses the expression “for his

    consideration” thereby indicating that the President is not bound to accord
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 342 of 414
assent to a bill even when it is presented to him for the second time. In other

    words, the object behind presentation of the bill for the second time after

    reconsideration under
Articles 111
and
200
respectively is to obtain assent,

    whereas under
Article 201
, the object of the presentation is to yet again

    present the bill for the consideration of the President.
374. Further, the proviso to
Article 201
places an obligation on the State

    legislature to reconsider the bill in accordance with the suggestions of the

    President within a period of six months from the date of receipt of the

    message containing the suggestions. There is no similar obligation on the

    Parliament or the State legislature to reconsider the bill within a stipulated

    time period under
Articles 111
and
200
respectively. This absence of this

    six-month time period under
Articles 111
and
200
respectively could also be

    seen as an indication of the primacy which is accorded to the Parliament and

    State Legislature as regards the bill which is presented for assent under the

    said provisions. They may choose to repass the Bill after taking into account

    the message which has been sent without being bound by the rigours of a

    time-limit. This is because it is they who ultimately decide whether the bill

    would see the light of day or not, as far as
Articles 111
or 200 are concerned.

    As discussed by us in the preceding paragraphs, under
Articles 111
and
200
respectively, the bill would only “fall through” if the Parliament or the State

    Legislature chooses or elects not to repass the concerned bill after it has been
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 343 of 414
returned to them and the trust of expediency has been reposed on the

    constitutional head of the country and State, being the President and the

    Governor respectively. However, under
Article 201
, the prescription of the

    time-limit of six months for the State legislature to reconsider the bill

    returned to them, is indicative of the fact that the requirement to act

    expediently is also placed on the State legislature.
377. Dr. K.C. Markandan writes that
Article 201
seeks to serve the same purpose

         in the legislative sphere as
Article 365
seeks to do in the administrative

         sphere, namely, make the Constitution “unfederal” in character, to establish

         the fact that the distribution of legislative power between the Centre and the

         States is not on an exclusive basis but that the exercise of legislative power

         of the State is subject to the overall responsibility of the Centre and its

         legislative ambit. He states that no other explanation can justify the inclusion

         of this provision in the Constitution.31
379. The features of
Article 201
which have been the cause of differences in

     Centre-State relations over the years are as follows:
382. While the language of
Article 201
does not provide for any timelines within

     which the President is required to act, the absence of a time limit cannot be

     construed as indicating that the discharge of functions by the President under

     the said Article can be done without due deference to the important nature

     of the role they occupy as regards the legislative machinery of the State. Any

     bill(s) reserved for the consideration of the President cannot become an act

     unless it receives the assent as is mentioned in
Article 201
, and thus, long

     and undue delays in the disposal of references by the President would have

     the effect of keeping the bill(s), which are an expression of the popular will

     embodied by the State legislature, in an indefinite and uncertain state of

     abeyance.
383. Although we are cognisant of the fact that in discharge of his powers under
Article 201
, the President is expected to “consider” the bill and such

     “consideration” may be difficult to be bound by strict timelines, yet it cannot

     be a ground to justify inaction on part of the President.
384. We have discussed in detail in the preceding paragraphs that where no time

     for the exercise of a power has been stipulated, such power must be

     exercised in a reasonable time, so as to not render the subject matter

     nugatory or dilute the purpose sought to be achieved. The delay on part of

     the President in deciding a reference under
Article 201
, without any

     justification or necessity, would fall foul of the basic constitutional principle

     that the exercise of a power must not be arbitrary and capricious. The

     implications of inaction being of a serious nature and detrimental to the

     federal fabric of the Constitution, there should be no scope for unnecessary

     delay on part of the President under
Article 201
as well.
389. It becomes clear upon the perusal of the guidelines that in recognition of the

     urgent and important nature of
Article 201
, the Central Government has

     framed clear guidelines as regards the time limits and the manner in which

     references under
Article 201
are expected to be disposed of. The guidelines

     also lay down that any delay caused in the seeking of clarifications and

     making of suggestions by any Ministry would have to be explained by

     furnishing reasons, in the absence of which, it would be assumed that they

     have no objections. It would be apposite for us to observe here that the idea

     of imposing timelines on the various stakeholders would not be antithetical

     or alien to the procedure that surrounds the discharge of constitutional

     functions under
Article 201.
The existence of the aforesaid two Office

     Memorandums further substantiates such an interpretation. Afterall, no

     memorandum which is contrary to the substance and spirit of
Article 201
can be allowed to command any procedure between the Union and the States

     The factum of its existence and acceptance reveals that the requirement of

     expeditious or even a strict time-bound action would be consistent with the

     aim and object of
Article 201.
392. We may now advert ourselves to the question on the nature of the proviso to
Article 201
and whether it is intrinsically attached to the option of

     withholding of assent available to the President under
Article 201
, similar to

     how the first proviso is fastened to the option of withholding assent available
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 359 of 414
to the Governor under
Article 200.
Furthermore, how and in what scenarios

    would the President resort to directing the Governor to return the bill to the

    House or Houses together with a message?
201. Despite this, we must not lose sight of the fact that it was also

    authoritatively
laid down in
the same decision that a proviso may fulfil the

    purpose of being an exception or, explanation/addition to the substantive

    provision of a statute. Therefore, despite the absence of a similar expression

    mandating the President to not withhold assent in the proviso to
Article 201
,

    constitutional principles would require us to read the proviso in conjunction

    with the option of withholding assent which the President is empowered to

    choose from.
395. Since the notion of ‘simpliciter withholding’ is an anathema to
Article 200
of the Constitution, there cannot be any gainsaying that any ‘withholding of

     assent’ in terms of
Article 201
must also only take place on the strength of

     a specific provision of the Constitution that envisages the requirement of

     assent of the President in the first place i.e., those traceable to instances

     envisaged under Article(s) 31A
, 31C
, 254(2)
, 288(2)
, 360(4)(i)(a)
, etc. but

     also must be accompanied by sound and specific reasons that necessitate the

     withholding, by clearly outlaying the policy considerations on which such

     an action is predicated.
396. While in the preceding paragraphs we have elaborated that the Governor

     does not hold the power to exercise ‘absolute veto’ on any bill, we see no

     reason why the same standard would also not apply to the President under
Article 201
as well. The President is not an exception to this default rule

     which permeates throughout our Constitution. Such unbridled powers

     cannot be said to remain in either of these constitutional posts. The only

     exception that has been carved out by the Constitution as regards the

     exercise of powers by the Governor and that of the President under Article(s)
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                     Page 361 of 414
200 and
201
of the Constitution is that in the former, the Governor once

    having withheld assent from a bill would then be bound to assent upon the

    reconsideration of such bill, whereas in the latter no such compulsion is

    constitutionally imagined for the President, owing to the very fact that the

    grant or withholding of assent in terms of
Article 201
is not the ordinary

    law-making procedure so far as the States are concerned, it is an

    extraordinary situation that only arises wherever policy considerations are

    involved in an otherwise State legislation but nevertheless having the

    propensity of a pan-country effect that is necessitated by the very quasi-

    federal nature of our polity.
399. However, at this stage we may clarify, that although the Memorandum

    mandates that there must be a channel of transparent and purposeful

    communication between the State Government and the Central Government,

    yet this does not mean that the requirement of sending a message in terms

    of the proviso to
Article 201
is eliminated. Mere existence of any

    communication that may take place prior to any decision being taken under
Article 201
is no reason to shirk the constitutional responsibility of officially

    communicating the message to the concerned State legislature. There lies a

    very fundamental difference between the communication envisaged under

    the Memorandum and that under the proviso to
Article 201.
The former is

    only to address any preliminary objections or doubts as regards the proposed

    bill and which prevent a meaningful decision from being taken by the
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 364 of 414
President under
Article 201
whereas under the latter, the idea is to

     communicate the reasons as to how the President arrived at his decision to

     withhold assent along with specifying the provisions of the proposed bill

     that should be reconsidered by the State legislature.
400. In other words, the sending of preliminary objections under the

     Memorandum cannot be equated to the message under the proviso to
Article

     201
, which is used to communicate the aspects of the proposed bill to be

     reconsidered and how they may be reconsidered by the State legislature.

     Unlike the memorandum, the message under
Article 201
of the Constitution

     is of seminal significance inasmuch as it facilitates the repassing of the bill

     by the State legislature. What emerges from the aforesaid is that when the

     President declares the withholding of assent of the State legislature’s

     proposed bill, it would be his constitutionally bounden duty to also set into

     motion the proviso to
Article 201.
401. In short, after due consultation with the State government, the President may

     either declare assent to the bill or he may declare that he withholds assent

     thereto. It would not be appropriate for the President to declare withholding

     of assent without first seeking clarifications from the State government as is

     mentioned in the guidelines featuring in the Office Memorandums. If, in the

     course of discussions, the State government expresses willingness to make
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 365 of 414
such changes to the bill as may be suggested by the Central government,

    then it would be open to the President to seek reconsideration of the bill by

    invoking the proviso, and upon the bill being re-considered and passed with

    such changes, the President may grant assent thereto.
402. At this stage, it would be prudent for the President while choosing to

    withhold assent to the bill and setting the proviso into motion, to address the

    issues, views, changes, amendments or recommendations that he may have

    comprehensively and in one go. Piecemeal exercise of the proviso to
Article

    201
must be dissuaded. This is to prevent the endless loop of sending and

    re-sending of the bill that may ensue between the President acting under the

    proviso to
Article 201
and the House or Houses of the State Legislature. A

    purposive interpretation of
Article 201
does not in any manner envisage a

    never-ending cycle of communications between the President and the State

    Government. Such conduct would tantamount to abusing the essence of the

    proviso which embodies fostering a collaborative spirit between the Union

    and the States. Therefore, the exercise of the power under the proviso must

    also be done in good faith and in a bona fide manner.
403. The object underlying
Article 201
and the significance it holds for the

    enforceability of a State legislation would be frustrated if the procedure

    therein is reduced to an endless cycle of back and forth without any chance
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 366 of 414
for fruition of the aspirations of the people of the State on mere

     technicalities. Therefore, the President is expected to follow the procedure

     envisaged under the proviso with a sense of responsibility whenever

     necessary. In the ordinary course of action, a bill must be sent back for the

     reconsideration of the State legislature under the proviso to
Article 201
, only

     once.
404. After the bill is sent with a message to State legislature by the President and

     they repass it, with or without amendments, the President would be

     empowered to take a final call on the giving or withholding of assent on the

     bill concerned. If he chooses to assent to the bill, it would become law. There

     is no gainsaying to the fact that the President under
Article 201
is conferred

     with the power to withhold a bill during the second round, without activating

     any other procedure, effectively bringing the legislative process vis-à-vis

     that same bill to an end, in contrast to the scheme of
Article 200
wherein the

     Governor must mandatorily accord his assent to a Bill which is presented to

     him for the second time.
415. The view taken In Re: Special Courts (supra) was that consultative

    jurisdiction under
Article 143
may avoid any possible challenges to the vires
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 375 of 414
of a bill if it becomes an Act. On basis of the dictum in the said reference,

    we are of the considered view that constitutional courts are not precluded

    from making suggestions or opining about the constitutional validity of a

    bill before the same becomes a law. This is because preventing a patently

    unconstitutional bill from being enacted saves not only public resources but

    also respects the wisdom of the legislature by providing the constitutional

    functionaries associated with the process of passage of a legislation, to

    review the bill and take appropriate actions. However, the approach of

    prevention before cure cannot be stretched to such extent, that the very

    process of reservation becomes a resort for thwarting the very legislative

    powers of the States. The President’s recourse to
Article 143
also palliates

    any apprehensions of bias or mala fides in the Central government’s

    approach to bills reserved under
Article 200.
424. We would also like to make a reference to Rule 48 of the Tamil Nadu

    Government Business Rules, 1978. The said Rule provides that whenever

    there is legislative proposal for a subject matter falling within the Concurrent

    List, the concerned administrative department should consult the Ministry

    of Home Affairs, whenever possible. Similar requirement is laid down for

    the legislations falling under
Articles 31A
, 31B
and
31C
of the Constitution.

    The rules read as follows:
426.
Article 142
of the Constitution empowers this Court, in the exercise of its

       jurisdiction to, pass such decree or make such order as is necessary for doing

       complete justice in any cause or matter pending before it.
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 388 of 414
(V)      Neither the concept of ‘pocket veto’ nor that of ‘absolute veto’ finds

         place within the constitutional scheme and mechanism envisaged

         under
Article 200
of the Constitution. The substantive part of
Article 200
consciously uses the expression “shall declare” to

         signify that there is no scope of inaction, and whenever a bill is

         presented to the Governor, he is under a constitutional obligation to

         adopt one of the three courses of action available therein. Further,

         the expression “as soon as possible” in the first proviso permeates
Article 200
with a sense of expediency and does not allow the

         Governor to sit on the bills and exercise pocket veto over them.

         Similarly, by virtue of the first proviso being intrinsically and

         inextricably attached to the option of withholding of assent, there

         is no scope for the Governor to declare a simpliciter withholding of

         assent, meaning thereby that ‘absolute veto’ is also impermissible

         under
Article 200.
(VI)     It goes without saying that the scheme of
Article 200
is

         characterized by the movement of the bill from one constitutional

         authority to another and that too with a sense of expediency. It is

         trite to say that
Article 200
occupies an important role of giving the

         bills passed by the State legislature the authority of an Act. Without

         the procedure envisaged under
Article 200
, the bills remain mere
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 389 of 414
pieces of paper, skeletons without any flesh or lifeblood flowing

         through their veins, mere documentation of the aspirations of the

         people without any possibility of bringing them to fruition.


(VII)    As a general rule, it is not open for the Governor to reserve a bill

         for the consideration of the President once it is presented to him in

         the second round, after having been returned to the House

         previously as per the first proviso. The use of the expression “shall

         not withhold assent therefrom” appearing in the first proviso places

         a clear embargo on the Governor and is a clear enunciation of the

         requirement that the Governor must assent to a bill which is

         presented to him after complying with the procedure
laid down in
the first proviso. The only exception to this general rule is when the

         bill presented in the second round is materially different from the

         one presented to the Governor in the first instance, as discussed in

         paragraph 204 of this judgment. In such a scenario, it would be

         open for the Governor to choose from the three options provided in

         the substantive part of
Article 200.
(X)      There is no expressly specified time-limit for the discharge of the

         functions by the Governor under
Article 200
of the Constitution.

         Despite there being no prescribed time-limit,
Article 200
cannot be

         read in a manner which allows the Governor to not take action upon

         bills which are presented to him for assent and thereby delay and

         essentially roadblock the law-making machinery in the State.


(XI)     The use of the expression “as soon as possible” in the first proviso

         makes it clear that the Constitution infuses a sense of urgency upon

         the Governor and expects him to act with expediency if he decides

         to declare the withholding of assent.
(iv) In case of presentation of a bill after reconsideration in

                accordance with the first proviso, the Governor must grant

                assent forthwith, subject to a maximum period of one-month.



(XV)     As the general rule, the Governor in exercise of his functions under
Article 200
is required to abide by the aid and advice tendered by
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 393 of 414
the Council of Ministers. The only exceptions to this rule can be

         traced to the second proviso to
Article 200
and
Article 163(1)
of

         the Constitution. Thus, only in instances where the Governor is by

         or under the Constitution required to act in his discretion, would he

         be justified in exercising his powers under
Article 200
contrary to

         the advice of the Council of Ministers. Further, any exercise of

         discretion by the Governor in exercise of his powers under
Article

         200
is amenable to judicial review.
The removal of the expression “in his discretion” from

         Section 75 of the GoI Act, 1935 when it was being adapted as
Article 200
of the Constitution clearly indicates that any discretion

         which was available to the Governor under the GoI Act, 1935 in
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 394 of 414
respect of reservation of bills became unavailable with the

         commencement of the Constitution.
Under
Article 200
of the Constitution, the Governor does not

         possess any discretion in the exercise of his functions and has to

         mandatorily abide by the advice tendered to him by the Council of

         Ministers. The only exceptions to this general rule are as follows:
(XVIII) There is no ‘pocket veto’ or ‘absolute veto’ available to the

         President in discharge of his functions under
Article 201.
The use

         of the expression “shall declare” makes it mandatory for the

         President to make a choice between the two options available under

         the substantive part of
Article 201
, that is, to either grant assent or

         to withhold assent to a bill. The constitutional scheme does not, in

         any manner, provide that a constitutional authority can exercise its

         powers under the Constitution arbitrarily. This necessarily implies

         that the withholding of assent under
Article 201
is to be

         accompanied by the furnishing of reasons for such withholding. We

         cannot say for a moment that the President would be allowed to not

         exercise the proviso to
Article 201
and not communicate reasons

         for the withholding of assent to the State legislature, as doing so

         would make the very inclusion of the proviso in
Article 200
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 398 of 414
redundant. Thus, the proviso to
Article 201
could be said to attach

         with the option of withholding of assent.
(XXIV) We summarise our findings on judicial review of the exercise of

         power by the Governor under
Article 200
and the exercise of power

         by the President under
Article 201
as follows:
(ii)     Where the reservation is on account of the bill attracting

                     any provision of the Constitution wherein the assent of

                     the President is a condition precedent for the proper

                     enactment and enforceability of such a bill as a law

                     (such as under Article 364A2) or for the purpose of

                     securing any immunity (such as under
Article 31A
) or

                     overcoming any repugnancy that may exist qua a

                     Central Legislation (under
Article 254(2)
), then the

                     Governor is expected to make a specific and clear

                     reference to the President properly indicating the

                     reasons for such reservation and inviting his attention as

                     described in Kaiser-I-Hind (supra). Such a reservation

                     can be assailed by the State Government, if the

                     reference made by the Governor either fails to indicate

                     the reasons for such reservation as discussed above or

                     that the reasons indicated are wholly irrelevant, mala-
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 403 of 414
fide, arbitrary, unnecessary or motivated by extraneous

                     considerations. Then such a reservation would be liable

                     to be set aside. This question being purely of a legal

                     nature would be completely justiciable and the

                     competent court would be after a proper adjudication

                     fully authorized to approve or disapprove of such

                     reservation by the Governor. If such a challenge finds

                     favour with the competent court, then, subject to any

                     other considerations, it would be fit case for issuance of

                     a writ in the nature of mandamus to the Governor for

                     appropriate action. If however, the challenge should fail

                     then the mechanism envisaged under
Article 201
of the

                     Constitution will spring into action.
441. The soul of India is its Constitution. Our Republic, the foresight of dynamic

     visionaries. What a great edifice, they built, ensuring sovereignty with

     democratic values. The Constitution is our bedrock ensuring our safety and

     security. It outlines a process that keeps us rooted in values. We read it for

     reference and for every policy decision. Without it, we would be lost and

     make many mistakes. It is now seventy-five years old, but we still keep

     turning to it, why? Because it guarantees our rights and sets benchmarks for

     our responsibilities. The laws and rules that uplift all people sprout from its

     pristine womb, welfare of all is its primary concern, but its sanctity and

     safety should be our prime concern.","3.   The Legislature for the State of Tamil Nadu, between 13.01.2020 and

     28.04.2023, enacted and forwarded 12 Bills to the Governor for grant of

     assent as per
Article 200
of the Constitution. Even though the present

     Governor took charge of the office with effect from 18.11.2021, yet he did

     not take the necessary action on any of the said Bills forwarded to his office

     till October 2023. The petitioner, being aggrieved by the inaction on part of

     the Governor, had to ultimately file the present writ petition before this

     Court. The same was filed on 31.10.2023.
5.   The State Legislature, on 18.11.2023, convened a special session and

     repassed the 10 bills which were returned by the Governor after withholding

     of assent. The bills were passed without any material change and were

     forwarded to the Governor’s Secretariat on the same day for his assent in

     accordance with the first proviso to
Article 200.
This Court, in its order dated

     20.11.2023, noted that since the repassed 10 bills were pending with the

     Governor, the hearing of the writ petition be adjourned to 01.12.2023 and

     issued directions that this Court shall be apprised of the progress in the

     matter.
4.⁠ ⁠However, State Government placed the Bill again in the
             Legislative Assembly and after getting Assembly's
             endorsement, sent them again to the Hon'ble Governor on
             18.11.2023.
10. Upon the suggestion made by this Court, the Governor, on 12.12.2023 wrote

     to the Chief Minister for the State of Tamil Nadu inviting him to a meeting

     in an attempt to resolve the deadlock. The Governor and the Chief Minister
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 11 of 414
met on 30.12.2023, pursuant to which the Chief Minister submitted a

    representation summarising the following issues:
15. It is only upon the present writ petition being filed and issuance of notice

              that the Governor’s office started acting upon the files. The Governor, on

              01.12.2023, submitted the factual position regarding the bills, files and other

              cases pending with his office detailing the actions taken thereupon. The

              details of the files requesting for sanction to investigate and prosecute and

              the Governor’s actions thereupon are summarised below:
19. It is the case of the petitioner that it was represented before the Governor by

      way of various representations that as per
Regulation 3
of the Tamil Nadu

      Public Service Commission Regulations, 1954, the Commission shall

      consist of a Chairman and 14 Members. However, no heed was paid to such

      representations. The functioning strength of TNPSC was of four members

      on the date of filing of the present petition.
21. The Governor, on 27.09.2023, returned the said files with a note raising

     some queries regarding transparency in the selection process, tenure of the

     members to be appointed and credentials of the proposed candidates. The

     Governor clarified that as the queries raised by his office were not addressed

     by the petitioner, the proposal for appointment of the recommended

     candidates was being returned and the same was no longer pending before

     him. This happened on 26.10.2023.
24. On 29.06.2023, the Governor suo moto and contrary to the aid and advice of

     the State Council of Ministers recommended the dismissal and divestment

     of portfolio of Senthil Balaji, a minister in the Tamil Nadu Cabinet on the

     ground that he was arrested by the Enforcement Directorate and was in

     judicial custody. However, the Governor addressed another letter to the

     Chief Minister on the very same day informing that he had kept the dismissal

     of Senthil Balaji in abeyance till further communication in light of the advice

     of the Union Minister of Home Affairs that it would be prudent to seek the

     opinion of the Attorney General on the matter.
26. Accordingly, on 13.03.2024, the Speaker of the State Legislative Assembly

    declared that the disqualification ceased to operate with effect from

    19.12.2023. The Election Commission also withdrew the notification of

    vacancy for his constituency.
27. The Chief Minister wrote to the Governor on 13.03.2024 to swear in Dr. K.

    Ponmudy as a Minister and allot to him the portfolio of Higher Education.

    However, the Governor vide the letter dated 17.03.2024, declined the request

    stating that the conviction order was suspended from its operation by way

    of ‘interim relief’ granted by this Court which meant that the conviction

    against Dr. Ponmudy, though existent, had been made non-operative and not

    set aside. The Governor also stated that the re-introduction of Dr. K.

    Ponmudy in the Cabinet would be against “constitutional morality”.
vi)   The counsel while highlighting the facts of the case at hand,

         submitted that the Governor had returned the Bills with the remarks

         “I withhold assent” which amounts to a clear withholding as per the

         second option of the substantive part of
Article 200.
When these

         Bills were returned to the Legislative Assembly, the Bills only

         contained a signed endorsement by the Governor with the remarks

         “I withhold assent” and there was no message for reconsideration.

In such a situation of simpliciter withholding of assent, the State

           Legislative Assembly cannot be precluded from re-considering the

           Bill and re-passing the Bill as the exercise of the option of

           withholding of assent brings into operation the first proviso

           whereby such Bills have to be returned to the State Legislative

           Assembly.
51. A few years after the ideation of the Swaraj Bill, the demand for self-

    government further found expression in the Congress-League Scheme of

    1916 which was a result of deliberations of the committees constituted

    jointly by the Indian National Congress and the All India Muslim League.

    The document envisioned a federal polity - with Provincial Legislative

    Councils for the provinces and an Imperial Legislative Council at the
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 74 of 414
national level. It is pertinent to note that as per the scheme, the Governor

was envisaged as the head of the provincial government and any bill passed

by the provincial legislature had to mandatorily receive his assent before it

became law. Further, the document also conferred upon the Governor-

General the power of vetoing any law passed by the provincial legislature.

Any bill passed by the Imperial Legislative Council had to receive the assent

of the Governor-General before it became law. The relevant provisions in

the said document are reproduced hereinbelow:
i.       Concept of assent to bills as envisaged by certain historical documents
         drafted during the freedom struggle.
95. The Commission was of the opinion that it is necessary to indicate at least a

       broad outline of the principles that should guide the Governor in the exercise

       of discretion, if any, vested in him. It was observed that the evolution of

       rules and guidelines in this respect is especially important in order to

       reconcile the actions of the Governor in his capacity as an agent of the Centre

       and the head of the State Executive.
123. As regards the withholding of Presidential assent, the Commission laid great

     emphasis that the Union Government ought to communicate to the State

     government, the reasons therefor. It was noted that the Union Government

     should enter into the practice of discussing the issues present in the bill with

     the State Government and making an effort to present its point of view to

     the State Government with reasons.
129. However, as regional political powers grew at the State level, the role of the

     Governor came to be a point of contention between the Centre and States

     with the latter leveling allegations of partiality and lack of objectivity in

     exercise of the Governor’s discretionary powers. As a result, the

     Commission was enjoined with the task of providing recommendations for

     better working of the office of the Governor.","22. The petitioner, on the other hand, has averred in its writ petition that such

     queries were against the established practices to the selection of

     constitutional posts and that the availability of the chairman and members in

     the TNPSC was essential to monitor and expedite various recruitment

     processes as well as promotions. Delays in appointments to the TNPSC

     resulted in non-availability of sufficient members, which detrimentally

     affected the functioning of the Executive.
30. In the aforesaid factual matrix, the petitioner have prayed for a declaration

     that the reservation of the bills by the Governor for the consideration of the

     President after they were repassed by the State Legislature and presented

     before him as illegal. Further, as a sequitur, the petitioner have prayed that

     the act of withholding of assent by the President be declared as void ab-

     initio. The petitioner have also prayed for a declaration that the simpliciter

     withholding of assent by the Governor without following the procedure

     prescribed in the first proviso to
Article 200
, be also declared to be illegal

     for being in contravention to the position of law as
laid down in
State of

     Punjab (supra). The petitioner have also prayed for a direction to the

     Governor to accord sanction for prosecution, take prompt decision on the

     pending files pertaining to grant of remission and to clear the proposal for

     appointment of members to the TNPSC.
200) presented before the Constituent Assembly. However,

         ultimately, the expression conferring discretion was dropped and
Article 200
came to be adopted in its present form. He submitted

         that the reason for this was explained by Dr. Ambedkar who said

         that there can be no room for the Governor to act on his discretion

         in a responsible form of government. Further, it was explained by

         Mr. T.T. Krishnamachari that the returning of the Bill to the

         Legislature will only be upon the advice of the Council of Ministers

         and not on the personal discretion of the Governor.
iii)   He submitted that the expression “shall not withhold assent

          therefrom” in the first proviso to
Article 200
takes away the option

          of reserving the Bill for the consideration of the President from the

          Governor when the Bill is repassed by the State Legislature and

          presented before him for assent. In support of his submission, he

          argued that the use of a negative expression renders the course of

          action prescribed as mandatory in nature. He further submitted that

          the phraseology of the first proviso to
Article 200
is different from

          the proviso to
Article 201
inasmuch as the latter does not oblige the

          President to mandatorily assent to the Bill after it has been repassed

          by the State Legislature and is presented before him again.

          Whereas, in contrast, the first proviso to
Article 200
is couched in

          a negative language and thus prohibits the Governor from taking

          any other recourse than granting assent.
i)     Mr. Dwivedi submitted that the power to reserve the Bill for the

          consideration of the President is not open ended. If specific

          provision of the Constitution does not require Presidential assent to

          the Bill passed by State Legislature, then such a Bill cannot be

          reserved for the consideration of the President.
ii)    He submitted that a further limitation on the power to reserve a Bill

          is that it can only be reserved on the aid and advice of the Council

          of Ministers and the Governor has no personal discretion in this

          matter.
Articles 31A
, 31C
, 213
, 254
, 288
, 304(b)
, 360
and 6th

          Schedule are the only provisions which expressly require assent of

          President. It is only when these articles are attracted that the

          Governor can reserve the Bills for consideration of the President.

          In the exclusive domain of Legislation under the State List or List-

          II of the 7th Schedule of the Constitution, no assent of President is

          needed.
iii)   On the aspect of repugnancy, he submitted that the letter of the

          Governor informing that the Bills were being reserved for the

          consideration of the President fails to specify the Central law with

          which States Bills are repugnant. This indicates non-application of
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 34 of 414
mind. He submitted that in Kaiser-I-Hind Pvt. Ltd. and Anr. v.
iv)   On the aspect of reading in a time limit within the scheme of
Article

             200
, he submitted that an outer limit of 2 to 3 months needs to be

             stipulated by this court to obviate exercise of pocket-veto by the

             Governors. Delays of over 3 months needs to be curbed.
iv)   He further submitted that a decision is not an authority for what can

         be read into it by implication or by assigning an assumed intention

         of the judges and inferring from it a proposition of law which the

         judges have not specifically or expressly
laid down in
the

         pronouncement.
i)    On the aspect of the position of the President under
Article 201
, he

         submitted that the President is not required to mandatorily assent to

         the bill that is presented to him for his consideration after being

         repassed by the State Legislature, once such bill has been sent back

         by the President under the proviso to
Article 201
in the first

         instance.
ii)    It was submitted that
Article 201
does not contain the expression

          “shall not withhold assent therefrom” in the proviso unlike the first

          proviso to
Article 200.
He further submitted that this Court in

          Kaiser-I-Hind (supra) had held that the assent of the President

          envisaged under
Articles 31-A
, 31-C
, 254(2)
and
304(b)
of the

          Constitution respectively constitutes a distinct class and category

          of its own and is different from the assent envisaged under
Articles

          111
of the President or
Article 200
of the Governor. A bare perusal

          of
Article 201
indicates that even when the Houses of the State

          Legislature re-pass the Bill and present it for consideration in terms

          of the proviso to
Article 201
, there is no compulsion on the

          President to accord assent.
33. Mr. P. Wilson, the learned Senior Counsel, made extensive submissions on

    behalf of the petitioner. For the sake of brevity, we are recording only those

    submissions which are in addition to the points already canvassed by Mr.

    Dwivedi and Mr. Singhvi respectively:
35. Mr. Vikramjit Banerjee, the learned Additional Solicitor General, appeared

    for the respondents and submitted as follows:
General for the signification in the King’s name of the King’s
            assent.”
General has assented thereto and that assent has been
            signified by the Governor-General to, and published by the
            Governor.
74. On the 30th of July, 1949, Dr. B.R. Ambedkar moved an amendment, as

        discussed aforesaid, for the substitution of the first proviso under draft
Article 175
, which later came to be successfully adopted by the Constituent

        Assembly. While moving for the substitution and highlighting that

        predominantly three key changes were sought to be made to the first proviso,

        he remarked that the words “in his discretion” under the draft
Article 175
were sought to be deleted because it was felt that “in a responsible

        government, there can be no room for the Governor acting on discretion”3.

        Shri. Brajeshwar Prasad was not whole-heartedly in favor of the changes

        suggested to the first proviso and contended that they would strip the

        Governor of the power to veto a bill or reserve it for the consideration of the

        President, in his own discretion or initiative and he would be able to do so

103. The Commission observed that the rule is that the Governor shall perform

     his functions on the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers of the State

     and the exercise of discretionary powers by him is the exception. The

     Commission envisaged that discretionary powers of reservation of a bill

     under
Article 200
should be exercised by the Governor only in rare cases

     where a bill is patently unconstitutional in his opinion. However, the

     Governor should not act contrary to the aid and advice of the Council of

     Ministers merely because he, in his personal capacity, does not favour the

     policy embodied in the bill. The relevant observations of the Commission

     are reproduced below:
108.
Article 254(1)
saves the power of the State legislatures to make laws with

     respect to matters in the concurrent list from being automatically superseded

     by the operation of the doctrine of repugnancy.
Article 254(2)
allows a law

     enacted by the State legislature and repugnant to the central law on the same

     subject-matter, to operate and prevail in that State provided that such State

     law receives the assent of the President.
110. It was noted by the Commission that the assent by the President to the State

     bills had been withheld on certain occasions on the ground that the Union

     was contemplating a more comprehensive legislation on the same subject

     matter. However, withholding of assent on such a premise at the level of the

     Union may unnecessarily delay or defeat the measures sought to be taken by

     the State legislature. Since the Parliament retains the power to amend, vary

     or repeal such a State legislation, even after its enactment, by passing a

     subsequent law inconsistent therewith, the Commission recommended that

     Presidential assent should not ordinarily be withheld on the ground that the

     Union is contemplating a comprehensive law in future on the same subject-

     matter.
112. On the question of the Union Executive’s discretion to withhold assent to a

     State bill on the ground of non-conformity with its policy, the Commission

     sounded a note of caution saying that policy considerations should not

     ordinarily be treated as a valid ground for withholding Presidential assent.
Article 201
confers supervisory powers on the Union Executive to enable it

     to secure a broad uniformity across central and state legislations in the

     interests of the social and economic unity of the country. However, the said

     provision cannot act as a measure for the Union Executive to bring to a

     grinding halt a State bill by withholding assent thereto if such a bill does not

     conform to its policy in general.
113. Further, the Union Executive is required to exercise utmost caution,

     circumspection and restraint in the exercise of supervisory powers under
Article 201
, especially in respect of the bills on subject matters that fall

     within the State List. In this regard, the Commission recommended that as a

     matter of convention, the President should not withhold assent only on

     consideration of policy differences on matters relating, in pith and substance,

     to the State List, except on the grounds of patent unconstitutionality.
119. The question whether there was a requirement of introducing time-limits in
Article 201
was necessary or not was also looked into by the Commission.

     It was reiterated that streamlining the procedure of reserving a State bill for

     Presidential consideration and enabling a mechanism for high-level

     discussions between the Union and State at the stage of drafting such bill

     may effectively reduce procedural delays at the level of the Union

     Government. Nevertheless, it was recommended that the Union and State

Governments should adopt definite timelines for processing State bills and

    disposing of their references to the President.
121. With a view to ensure that the timelines so suggested are not frustrated by

     lack of clarity and comprehensiveness in a reference, the Commission

     underscored the importance of a self-contained communication by the

     President to the State legislature for clarification or reconsideration of the

     bill. It was emphasized that clarifications to be sought by way of the proviso

     to
Article 201
should not be piecemeal.
122. While the Commission noted the significance of clear timelines for the

     exercise of powers under
Articles 200
and
201
respectively, it did not

     recommend any amendments to the said Articles for introducing concrete

     time periods within the constitutional scheme and left its recommendations

     in this regard at the stage of conventions only.
136. The Commission further emphasized the necessity of prescribing time limits

     for the exercise of powers under
Articles 200
and
201
respectively in order
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 124 of 414
to ensure that discretionary powers are not exercised by the Governor or the

     President in a manner that undermines the State legislature and the will of

     the people.
154. By the introduction of the Constitution Act, 1986, the Sovereign began to

     act on the advice of the Executive Council which is the part of the executive

     branch of government. It states that a bill passed by the House of

     Representatives becomes law when the Sovereign or the Governor-General

     grants assent.
Section 3
of the Act states that the power conferred on the

     Governor-General are royal powers exercised on behalf of the Sovereign.

     These powers may be exercised either by the Sovereign in person or by the

     Governor-General. Additionally, any reference in an Act to the Governor-

     General in Council also includes the Sovereign acting with the advice and

     consent of the Executive Council. The Prime Minister-designate is

     appointed as the Executive Councillor and he advises the Governor-General

     to appoint other Councillors. Section 3A removes any discretion of the

     Sovereign or the Governor-General, stating that they may exercise a power

     on the advice and with the consent of the Executive Council.
156. It is said that the role of the Governor-General is to ensure due process – that

        the bill was passed in Houses following the procedure. He is not concerned

        with the contents of the legislation as the act of the Governor-General is

        executive. However, in the context of Governor (state level), the Court of

        Appeal in Eastgate v. Rozzoli, reported in (1990) 20 NSWLR 188, noted

        that while giving assent the Australian State Governor acts as a constituent

        part of the Parliament. If a bill is reserved for Queen’s pleasure, she acts

upon the advice of Australian Commonwealth Ministers. The power to refer

     bills back to Parliament can be exercised only upon ministerial advice. At

     the states, the parliamentary officers seek State Governor’s assent.

     Ordinarily, the State Governors assent to bills without any ministerial

     advice, only South Australia endeavors to provide executive advice to the

     Governor.
173. He argued that in cases where the bill suffers from some gross and manifest

     unconstitutionality, the Governor need not invoke the procedure mentioned

     in the first proviso and it would be sufficient if he declares a simpliciter

     withholding of the bill. As a corollary, he submitted that the procedure

     prescribed under the first proviso may be followed by the Governor when

     he is of the belief that the bill, which is otherwise constitutional, may benefit

     from certain amendments and in such a case he may send a message to the

     State legislature suggesting certain amendments to the bill.
221. Shri H.V. Kamath vehemently opposed the amendment put forward by Dr.

    Ambedkar. Advocating for expeditious and timely action, he argued that,

    “in human nature, if you will permit me to say so, unless there is a

    compelling sense of duty or service, there is always a tendency to
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 179 of 414
procrastinate”.11 It was his opinion that such tendencies to procrastinate

        must be rooted out by infusing a standard of duty or service to ensure timely

        action on part of the President. He further opined that there exists no

        assurance that every President of India will consistently adhere to the

        principle of timely action in legislative processes. Therefore, according to

        him, it was very necessary that the “Constitution should provide specifically

        a time limit for a contingency of this nature”12. He believed the phrase “as

        soon as possible” to be vague, purposeless and meaningless, and argued that

        such vague phrases have no place in a provision of such an important nature.
254. He also submitted that there was no discretion available to the Governor

      under the scheme of
Article 200
of the Constitution and the only exception

      to the same was provided in the second proviso to
Article 200
itself. In other

      words, he contended that the Governor could only reserve a bill against the
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 213 of 414
advice tendered to him by the Council of Ministers, if the bill was of a

    description as provided in the second proviso. He submitted that in all other

    cases, the reservation of a bill for the consideration of the President had to

    take place strictly in accordance with the advice of the Council of Ministers.
256. Mr. Dwivedi, placing reliance on the deletion of the expression “in his

    discretion” from both the substantive part of
Article 200
as well the first

    proviso by the Constituent Assembly, proposed an even stricter

    interpretation of
Article 200.
He argued that the deletion of the expression

    “in his discretion” indicated that the intention of the framers of the

    Constitution was crystal clear that the Governor should have no semblance

    of discretion while exercising his powers under
Article 200
and he should

    act in accordance with the advice rendered by the Council of Ministers. He

    further submitted that it is not just reservation of the bills for the

    consideration of the President, but the grant of assent, as well as the decision

    to send the bill back to the State legislature together with a message upon
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 214 of 414
the withholding of assent, which must be taken strictly in accordance with

    the advice of the Council of Ministers.
existing Central Act on the vesting of evacuee
             properties but, his assent was sought for a
             different, specific purpose altogether”,

        would belie any such claim. Per contra, it would only
        reinforce the principle that the consideration as well as the
        decision to accord consent should be a conscious one, after
        due application of mind, relevant and necessary for the
        purpose. Though, submission of a thesis on the various
        aspects of repugnancy involved may not be the requirement,
        the reservation for “consideration” would necessarily
        obligate an invitation of the attention of the President as to
        which of the pre-existing Central enactments or which
        provisions of those enactments are considered or
        apprehended to be repugnant, with reference to which the
        assent envisaged in
Article 254(2)
is sought for. This becomes
        all the more necessary also for the reason that the
        repugnancy in respect of which predominance is sought to be
        secured must be shown to exist or apprehended, on the date
        of the State law and not in a vacuum to cure any and every
        possible repugnancy in respect of all laws — irrespective of
        whether it was in the contemplation or not of the seeker of the
        assent or of the President at the time of “consideration” for
        according assent.","31. Mr. Rakesh Dwivedi, the learned Senior Counsel appearing for the

     petitioner, made elaborate submissions on the following aspects:
The Governor could not have kept the Bills submitted to him
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 25 of 414
between the years 2020 and 2023 in a cold storage without taking

         any decision on them. The fact that he entered no discussion with

         the State Government or the Chief Minister in relation to the Bills

         submitted to him further indicates that the Governor exercised

         pocket veto in relation to the said Bills, thereby bringing the

         constitutional machinery to a standstill. He submitted that the

         substantive part of
Article 200
uses the expression “shall declare”

         which indicates that the function of the Governor is mandatory. The

         underlying objective of
Article 200
is to make a Bill operative as

         an Act. Therefore, the scheme of
Article 200
negates the possibility

         of engaging in inordinate delay or pocket veto.
ii)   The Governor failed to take note of the decision of this Court in

         State of Punjab (supra). Although the said decision held that the

         first proviso to
Article 200
attaches to the option of withholding

         assent, yet the Governor recorded a simpliciter finding of

         withholding assent without conveying any message to the State

         Legislature, as provided under the first proviso. He submitted that

         simpliciter withholding of assent by the Governor is also violative

         of
Article 14
which mandates that the exercise of Constitutional

         powers should be based on reason and transparency. The State

         Legislature must be told why the assent has been withheld so as to
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 26 of 414
enable it to reconsider the Bill. He further submitted that in the

          absence of any message, it would be open to the State Legislature

          to understand that the Governor wishes the entire Bill to be

          reconsidered.
iii)   On the facts of the present case, Mr. Dwivedi submitted that having

          recorded that the Bills submitted to him were intra vires of the State

          Legislature, it was not open to the Governor to reserve the Bills for

          the consideration of the President upon being repassed and

          presented again before him. He submitted that once the reservation

          of the Bills for the consideration of the President is found to be

          erroneous in law, any subsequent withholding of assent by the

          President would also be legally vitiated.
i)    Mr. Dwivedi submitted that no constitutional power vested in any

         authority, howsoever high, is beyond the powers of judicial review

         of the constitutional courts. The scope of judicial review may vary,

         but no power is beyond the purview of the courts. The Courts may

         exercise restraint, but that is not to say that if the power has been

         exercised unconstitutionally, manifestly arbitrarily, in breach of

         fundamental rights enshrined in Part III or any other provision of

         the Constitution, or in a mala fide manner, the courts would be

         prohibited from striking down the exercise of such power.
iii)   In light of the aforesaid, he submitted that the position of law as on

          date, as explained by several Constitutional Bench decisions, is

          clear that no exercise of Constitutional power is outside the ambit

          of judicial review. No power is absolute and non-justiciable. Hence,

          the power exercised under
Article 200
can also be examined by this

          court to discern any unconstitutionality.
c) Governor is required to act upon the aid and advice of the Council
   of Ministers.
iii)   He further submitted that the discretion of the Governor under the

          Indian Constitution is governed solely by
Article 163(1)
and the

          interpretation adopted by this Court has been such which does not

          make the Governor dominant over the Chief Minister, who is an

          elected representative of the people.
i)    He submitted that the exercise of power to withhold assent by the

         Governor is coupled with the duty of the Governor to comply with

         the procedure prescribed in the first proviso to
Article 200
and the
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 32 of 414
same has been recognised in the decision in
State of Punjab
(supra).
ii)    On the use of the expression “shall declare” in the substantive part

          of
Article 200
, he submitted that this expression in the main part of
Article 200
would, by necessary implication, require the Governor

          to mention the reasons for withholding the assent.
32. Dr. Abhishek Manu Singhvi, the learned Senior Counsel appearing for the

    petitioner, made detailed submissions broadly on the following aspects:
i)    Mr. Singhvi submitted that the relevant consideration at the end of

         the Governor when a bill is presented before him for assent broadly

         should be as follows:
i)    He submitted that the expression “as soon as possible” provided in

           first proviso to
Article 200
does not provide any strict time limit to

           be followed by the Governor to decide upon the Bills presented for

           assent, but that should not and cannot mean that the Governor can

           keep a Bill duly passed by the State Legislative Assembly

           “pending” for indeterminate periods. This course of action is

           inconsistent with the phrase “as soon as possible”.

             exercised its powers under
Article 142
of the Constitution

             directing that the prisoner was deemed to have served the

             sentence.
iii)   Mr. Singhvi referred to Chapter V of the report of the Sarkaria

          Commission on Centre-State Administrative Relations wherein it

          was suggested that the Governor should make a declaration under
Article 200
within one month from the date on which the Bill is

          presented. He also referred to the Punchhi Committee Report on

          Centre-State Relations which recommended “maximum period of

          six months after Bill is presented” to be the time limit to be

          followed by the Governor under
Article 200.
v)    Lastly, he submitted that even if the decision in
Valluri Basavaiah

(supra) is interpreted as a binding precedent, still such

         interpretation of the
Article 200
would fall foul of the intention

         envisaged by the Constituent Assembly.
i)    He submitted that the Governor could be said to have committed

         violence to the constitutional framework by not adhering to the

         mandate under
Article 200
of the Constitution and has also

         attempted to render the present Writ Petition infructuous during its

         pendency.
96. Having discussed the discretion of the Governor in matters of constitutional

       decision-making at length, the Commission recommended that a specific

       provision should be inserted in the Constitution to enable the President to

       issue Instruments of Instructions to the Governors laying down guidelines

       or principles with reference to which the Governor should act including the

       occasions for the exercise of discretionary powers.
105. Discretion, in exercise of powers under
Article 200
, therefore, should be

     dictated by reason, actuated by good faith and tempered by caution.

     Discretionary functions should be performed in public interest and cannot

     be discharged at the dictation of any outside authority unless so authorized

     by and under the Constitution.
128. The Commission, inter alia, looked at the original scheme of the Centre-
iii.    Whether there is an express constitutionally prescribed time-limit
        within which the Governor is required to act in the exercise of his
        powers under
Article 200
of the Constitution?
212. It was argued by the petitioner that the Governor in exercise of his powers

     under
Article 200
is required to act promptly and the absence of any

     prescribed time period should not be construed as allowing the Governor the

     liberty to act on his own free will and volition. It was also submitted that

     the expression “as soon as possible” appearing in the first proviso places an

     obligation on the Governor to act promptly and with expedience.
220. Shri P.S. Deshmukh expressed his opposition to the amendment proposed

    by Dr. B.R. Ambedkar, deeming the suggested substitution of the words as

    unnecessary. He, on the other hand, argued that the original phrasing,

    particularly the expression “not later than six weeks”, ought to remain

    unaltered, as it established a precise time frame for the President to act

    accordingly. He further argued that this specific time frame mandated that

    the President must convey his decision to return the bill for reconsideration

    as expeditiously as possible, and in no event beyond six-weeks. He opined

    that preserving the words “not later than six weeks” was quintessential to

    ensure timely action, thereby preventing undue delays in the legislative

    process to send the bills back to the House(s) for reconsideration.
253. Mr. Rohatgi, learned Senior Counsel, submitted that the act of the Governor

      amounts to a subversion of the Constitution. He further emphatically

      submitted that it indeed amounted to a subversion of the Constitution.
257. The Attorney General, per contra, argued that while exercising his powers

    under
Article 200
, the Governor is discharging an important constitutional

    obligation, and even if he does not exercise individual discretion, he may

    still act against the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers if he is so

    required to, in the discharge of his constitutional duties.

other Articles which specifically reserve the discretionary power for the

    Governor. It must not be construed as a general clause which gives the

    Governor the power to disregard the advice of his ministers in any matter in

    which he finds that he could disregard their opinion.
322. It was contended by the petitioner that no exercise of power under the

    Constitution could be said to be beyond the scope of judicial review as every

    authority, howsoever high, is expected to perform its functions within the

    constitutional framework. It was submitted that if the exercise of powers by

    the Governor under
Article 200
is held to be outside the scope of judicial
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 282 of 414
review, then that would render him to be a super-constitutional figure in the

     State, who would be able to override the legislature and the government

     elected by the people, at his whims and fancies and without any checks and

     balance.","4.   This Court issued notice to the respondents on 10.11.2023. The Governor,

     forthwith, took a decision on the 12 Bills on 13.11.2023 by withholding

     assent simpliciter to 10 bills i.e., he did not convey any message to the State

     Legislature for reconsideration of the said Bills as prescribed under the first
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                         Page 5 of 414
proviso to
Article 200
, and by reserving two Bills for the consideration of

     the President. The 10 bills for which assent was withheld were returned to

     the State Legislature by the Governor.
6.   On 28.11.2023, the Governor, without the aid and advice of the Council of

     Ministers of the State, in exercise of his discretion, reserved the said

     repassed Bills for the consideration of the President. The letter of the

     Governor to the Union Government referring the said Bills for the

     consideration of the President mentioned that the Bills were re-considered

     and passed again by the State Legislature. Interestingly, although the

     Governor noted that the Bills were intra-vires the competence of the State

     Legislature having been legislated under Entry 66 of List I, Entry 32 of List
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                          Page 6 of 414
II and Entry 25 of List III, yet he reserved the said Bills for the consideration

of the President in the second round on the ground that the Bills suffered

from repugnancy on account of being contrary to Entry 66 of the Union List

i.e., List I. These grounds have been taken by the Governor to reserve the 10

Bills for consideration of the President. For reference, we have extracted the

relevant portion of the letter pertaining to the Tamil Nadu Fisheries

University (Amendment) Bill, 2023 which reads thus:
i)     Mr. Dwivedi submitted that the various provisions of the

          Constitution stand in harmony and are interdependent. They are not

          isolated silos. They share the ultimate objective of harmonious

          Parliamentary governance, seek welfare of the people and

          implement Parliamentary form of democracy within a federal

          system. Therefore, interpretation of a Constitutional provision

          should accord with these fundamental principles and the basic

          structure of the Constitution.
3. In all other cases, the Governor has three options to choose from

            when the bill is presented before him for the first time – to either

            assent, or withhold assent, or reserve the Bill for the consideration

            of the President.
ii)   He submitted that after the Governor has withheld assent to a bill

         and returned the same to the Legislative Assembly, it is not open to

         the Governor to reserve the said bill for the consideration of the

         President once the Legislative Assembly re-passes it with or
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                         Page 40 of 414
without amendment. If the Governor wants to reserve any bill for

          the consideration of the President, he must do so in the first instance

          when the bill is presented to him for assent. The Governor can

          choose any one of the three options at the first instance but if he

          exercises the option to withhold assent, then the option of reserving

          the bill for the consideration of the President ceases to exist because

          the next step in such a case is to follow the procedure prescribed

          under first proviso to
Article 200.
v)    The Governor can only return the bill when he has withheld the

         assent. The Governor cannot be expected to keep the bill in his

         custody after withholding the assent as it would amount to a

         “pocket veto” or veto which is contrary to the intention of the

         makers of the Constitution. Any acceptance of such “suspended

         animation” doctrine of a Bill, supposedly kept indefinitely pending

         by a Governor, would be grossly violative of the Constitutional

         text, spirit and intent.
iii)   He submitted that the obiter dictum of the Supreme Court is binding

          under
Article 141
to the extent of the observations on points raised
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 48 of 414
and decided by the court in a case. Although the obiter dictum of

         the Supreme Court is binding on all courts yet it only has persuasive

         authority as far as the Supreme Court itself is concerned.
36. Having heard the learned counsel appearing for the parties and having gone

      through the materials on record, the following questions of paramount

      constitutional importance fall for our determination:
49. In the Canadian context, she explains that the royal assent ceremony was

     inherited from the United Kingdom tradition and was used prior to

     Confederation in both Lower and Upper Canada and closely resembled the

     original ceremony used in the United Kingdom. Prior to adoption of the new

     procedure in 2002, Canada was the only remaining Commonwealth country

     to still use the traditional ceremony for royal assent. However, taking

     inspiration from the practice prevailing in other Commonwealth countries

     including Australia and New Zealand, as well as several Canadian

     provinces, the royal assent procedure was modernised by adopting a written

     declaration procedure.
56. However, the Nehru Report of 1928 shortly followed the Commonwealth of

     India Bill, 1925 and was drafted in response to the dissatisfaction with the

     Simon Commission. The Report sought to negative the challenge posed by

     the British that a constitutional document, which is agreeable to all, could

     not be drawn by Indians, and contained elaborate provisions providing the

     mechanism for the purpose of assent to bills.
57. As regards the bills passed by the Parliament, it was stipulated in the Nehru

     Report that a bill would not become an Act until assent was granted by the

     Governor-General. The Governor-General was provided with three options
61. One more document that we would like to refer to is the “Constitution of

    Free India: A Draft” authored by M.N. Roy in 1944. The document proposed
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 84 of 414
a radically different version of assent to bills as distinguished from the

     scheme prevailing under the GoI Act, 1935 or other contemporaneous

     aspirational constitutional documents. The document vested no authority in

     the Governor to withhold assent to a bill passed by the provincial legislature

     or to veto the same. However, the document vested power in the Supreme

     People’s Legislature, which was a joint sitting of both the chambers of the

     Federal Legislature, to veto any provincial legislation. However, this veto

     power was subject to judicial review and the provincial government was

     given the right to challenge the veto before the Supreme Federal Court. The

     relevant provisions are reproduced hereinbelow:
62. What is interesting to note is that the imagination of a provision as regards

     assent to bills, when the country was on the brink of becoming independent
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 85 of 414
from the British rule, was significantly different from the previous versions

     envisaged in times when the freedom struggle was focused more on

     obtaining greater degree of self-rule while being under the sovereignty of

     the British Crown, as can be seen in the versions used in the Nehru Report

     and the Constitution of India Bill, 1925. The two documents which were

     drafted in 1944, and are
referred to above
, indicate that the Governor was

     vested with lesser powers and discretion, and there was a clear inclination

     towards a more unitary arrangement insofar as assent to bills was concerned.

     The ideas of judicial review of exercise of veto by the President against a

     state legislation, mandatory return of the bills for reconsideration upon

     withholding of assent, and deemed assent upon reconsideration were being

     experimented with among others in the immediate lead up to the framing of

     our Constitution.
73. With a view to better understand the intention of the framers of the

        Constitution, it is of utmost importance that we turn the pages of the debates

        that took place in the Constituent Assembly.
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 92 of 414
only when so advised by his Cabinet of Ministers. In his opinion, the change

    also meant that the Governor would not be able to veto a bill that has been

    passed twice by the Legislative Assembly, which he felt was not acceptable.
75. Shri. Brajeshwar Prasad acknowledged that there are two classes of cases in

    which a bill can be reserved for the consideration of the President – One,

    where a certain Article of the Constitution requires the same and two, when

    the Governor is advised by his Ministry to do so. However, he advocated for

    a third category i.e., where the Governor would possess the power, in his

    discretion, to veto a bill passed by the Legislature, irrespective of whether it

    was passed once or twice by it. He supported the vesting of discretion in the

    hands of the Governor so that he could veto unjust and unsound legislation

    while also ensuring that there is a check on potentially disruptive legislative

    tendencies. From his standpoint, the fear of disruptive legislation was not

    imaginary but real in our country and he advocated that his proposal was in

    consonance with the traditions of the centralized system of Government that

    existed in our country until independence. He was of the view that the

    parliamentary form of polity was a new experiment to the facts of life in our

    country and it was required to be moderated and regulated. Expressing his

    lack of confidence in the provincial Ministers, he contended that

    empowering the Governor to act in his discretion would not be so

    objectionable since the Governor is also the representative of the
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                         Page 93 of 414
Government of India and it is by virtue of this position that his views must

        prevail over those of the State legislature.
Allegations also came to be levelled by a number of State Governments that

     the Governor in a number of States was acting as an agent of the Central

     Government and the objectivity that was expected of the Governor was not

     being displayed, more particularly when it came to reservation of bills for

     the consideration of the President or recommendation for the imposition of

     emergency under
Article 356.
In light of the aforesaid, certain commissions

     came to be constituted which submitted their reports after undertaking

     exhaustive analysis of the working of the constitutional machinery

     prescribed for Centre-State relations. One of the key foci of these reports

     was the working of
Articles 200
and
201
of the Constitution respectively

     and the scope of exercise of discretion by the Governors, which we deem

     appropriate to discuss hereinafter.
85. The First Administrative Reforms Commission (the “ARC”) was

     established in January 1966 by a resolution of the Ministry of Home Affairs

     to examine the public administration of the country and make

     recommendations for reform and reorganization where necessary. An aspect

     of this exercise was the examination of Centre-State relations particularly
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                   Page 100 of 414
with respect to the need for national integration, and for maintaining

    efficient standards of administration throughout the country.
89. However, no such guidelines have been formulated by the Inter-State

      Council till date and none of the Commissions on Centre-State relations

      constituted thereafter made any recommendations on the issuance of

      guidelines for exercise of discretion by the Governor.
90. The Rajamannar Commission was set up by the Government of Tamil Nadu

      in 1969 under the chairmanship of Dr. P.V. Rajamannar to look into the

      question regarding the relationship that should subsist between the Centre

      and States in a federal set-up. The Commission noted that in the changed

      political circumstances, there can be no dispute regarding the fact that the

      Governors have a positive role to play in the stability and progress of States.

      This requires that the authority of the Governor should be clearly spelt out

      and the Governors should no longer consider themselves to be instruments

      of the Centre under compulsion to act on its directions and in its political

      interests.
98. The Sarkaria Commission was enjoined with the task of reviewing the

    Centre-State relationship and consider the importance of unity and integrity

    of the country for promoting the welfare of the people. One of the facets of

    such review was to discuss the scope of the role of the Governor and its

    impact on the federal polity of India.
99. For a number of years after the independence of India, the political scene

    was dominated by a single party and there was little occasion for strife

    between the central and state governments. The role of the Governor,

    therefore, remained latent. However, post-1967, the emergence of new

    regional political parties led to a discord between the central government

    and those state governments that came to be led by such new regional

    parties. These developments engendered political instability in several
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                    Page 106 of 414
states, as a result of which, the Governors were called upon to exercise their

     discretionary powers more frequently, particularly in recommending

     President’s rule and in reserving State bills for the consideration of the

     President.
100. The role of the Governor in giving assent to State bills, withholding assent

     therefrom or reserving such bills for the consideration of the President, thus,

     assumed importance. By virtue of
Articles 200
and
201
of the Constitution

     respectively, the office of Governor became a major stakeholder for the

     maintenance of a cordial relationship between the central and state

     governments. The Sarkaria Commission was, therefore, tasked with

     providing recommendations regarding the interpretation of the said Articles

     and amendments therein to strengthen the federal polity of India.
115. The Commission noted that the scheme of the Constitution providing for

     reservation of State legislations for the consideration and assent of the

     President, is intended to subserve the broad purpose of cooperative

     federalism in the realm of Union-State legislative relations. Therefore, the

     practice of according assent to a State bill by the President on the reciprocal

     assurance that the changes suggested by him (or the Union Executive) will

     be carried out by way of an ordinance, was not considered to be ideal

     especially when there exists a constitutional remedy under the proviso to
Article 201
itself.
118. As regards the suggestion of streamlining the procedures involved in

     reserving a State bill for consideration of the President, the Commission

     recommended that every reference from the State should be complete and

     clearly established. Such reference should set out precise material facts,

     points for consideration and the reason for making a reference to the

     President. Accordingly, the Commission recommended the following

     information to be necessarily provided for ensuring that the reference to the

     President is self-contained:
124. Before concluding the discussion on the aspect of reservation of bills by the

     Governor for consideration of the President, the Commission noted that

     needless reservation of bills should be avoided. The constitutional scheme

     does not envisage indiscriminate reservation of bills, especially when it is

     being done in his discretion, as the same would be subversive of the federal

     principle and the supremacy of the State legislature.
126. The Commission recommended that bills should be reserved only if required

    for specific purposes falling in the first two classes as extracted hereinabove.
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 120 of 414
State relations as laid down by the Constitution, examined the friction points

      in the working thereof and reviewed the adequacy of the constitutional

      arrangements for promoting social welfare and good governance. One aspect

      of this study involved looking minutely into the role of the Governor in the

      federal polity of India. The Commission noted that the role of the Governor

      became important as he had to balance the political considerations between

      the Centre and State and be as impartial as possible.
132. The Governor is not amenable to the directions of the Union government,

     nor does the Constitution make him accountable to the Centre for the manner

     in which he carries out his functions and duties. The office of Governor is

     an independent constitutional office. The Governor, by virtue of
Article 163
,

     however, is bound by the aid and advice of the State Council of Ministers.

     Therefore, in the event of a conflict between the aid and advice of the State

     Council of Ministers and the dictates of the Central Government, the scheme

     of the Constitution indicates that the Governor must adhere to the former.
133. With the broad tenets of the role of the Governor under the constitutional

     scheme, the Commission, while appraising the existing framework of

     Centre-State relations, observed that a major point of friction between the
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                     Page 123 of 414
Centre and States is the power of the Governor to reserve any State bill for

     the consideration of the President, sometimes even for an indefinite period.
140. Therefore, the Commission suggested that a period of six months should be

    prescribed in
Article 201
for the President to decide on assenting or

    withholding assent to a bill reserved for consideration of the President. In

    case the President on the aid and advice of the Union Council of Ministers,

    is unable to give assent to a State bill under
Article 201
, it is desirable for

    him to make a reference to the Supreme Court under
Article 143
for an

    opinion. Such reference should be done as a matter of practice in order to
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 126 of 414
avoid allegations of political bias, while securing the dignity and authority

     of the State legislature.
141. Having considered the challenges in the exercise of powers under
Articles

     200
and
201
respectively, the Commission reiterated the recommendations

     of the National Commission to Review the Working of the Constitution

     (“NCRWC”), which are reproduced hereinbelow:
(c) If the Bill is reserved for the consideration of the
             President, there should be a time-limit, say of three months,
             within which the President should take a decision whether to
             accord his assent or to direct the Governor to return it to the
             State Legislature or to seek the opinion of the Supreme Court
             regarding the constitutionality of the Act under
Article 143
             (as it happened in the case of Kerala Education Bill in 1958);
(d) When the State Legislature reconsiders and passes the
             Bill (with or without amendments) after it is returned by the
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 127 of 414
Governor pursuant to the direction of the President, the
             President should be bound to grant his assent;
(e) To provide that a ""Money Bill"" cannot be reserved by the
             Governor for the consideration of the President;
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                                   Page 129 of 414
prerogative of the monarch, yet it has long been an established convention

       that the monarch does not withhold it for a bill that has received approval

       from both Houses. The process of Royal Assent comprises two stages: first,

       the signification of the royal assent to a bill via the Royal Sign Manual on

       Letters Patent issued under the Great Seal of the Realm; and secondly, the

       communication of the King’s Assent to both Houses of Parliament. In the

       United Kingdom (UK), royal assent is regarded as a formality and has not

       been refused to a bill since Queen Anne’s reign in 1707.
23. This is compatible with the fundamental tenet of a
        parliamentary form of Government where the power to enact
        legislation is entrusted to the elected representatives of the
        people. The Governor, as a guiding statesman, may
        recommend reconsideration of the entirety of the Bill or any
        part thereof and even indicate the desirability of introducing
        amendments. However, the ultimate decision on whether or
        not to accept the advice of the Governor as contained in the
        message belongs to the legislature alone. That the message
        of the Governor does not bind the legislature is evident from
        the use of the expression “if the Bill is passed again …with
        or without amendments”.
183. Placing reliance on the expression “unless the procedure indicated in the

    first proviso is followed” the learned Attorney General submitted that the

    decision as regards whether the procedure prescribed under the first proviso

    is to be invoked or not, is the discretion of the Governor. It is only when the

    Governor decides to return the withheld bill along with a message that the

    first proviso would come into play. In other words, if the Governor believes

    that the bill is constitutionally infirm and beyond any remedial changes, then

    he may choose not to return the bill along with a message and may simply

    declare that he is withholding assent to the bill, in which case the bill would

    “fall through” or lapse.
184. Although the argument is seemingly lucrative and appealing, and the

    petitioner also could not provide a concrete reply to the same during the

    course of the arguments and instead took shelter under the semantics of

    obiter-dicta and ratio-decidendi, yet we deem it necessary to explain how

    the argument is short-sighted, half-baked and suffers from an inherent

    fallacy.
192. Therefore, the use of the expression “the Bill falls through unless the

    procedure indicated in the first proviso is followed” should be construed in

    the context of the entire procedure described in the first proviso. Seen thus,

    it would mean that the bill would fall-through if the bill, having been

    returned by the Governor, is not passed again by the State legislature and

    presented again to the Governor for his assent. The fallacy of the argument

    canvassed by the learned Attorney General lies in the very fact that he has

    construed the observations of this Court, pertaining to compliance with the

    procedural requirement under the first proviso, to mean that the mechanism

    under the first proviso can only be initiated upon the desire and discretion of

    the Governor.
195. Any other reading of the provision that construes the option of withholding

     of assent without attaching it to the mechanism prescribed in the first proviso

     would render the very idea of smooth functioning of the law-making process

     nugatory and would vest with the Governor untrammeled powers of

     thwarting the legislative machinery and in effect the will and aspirations of

     the people whose voices the legislature represents.
198. The Governor, in exercise of his powers under
Article 200
, also does not

    possess any absolute veto. He is mandated to take a decision from among

    the three options that are provided in the substantive part of the
Article 200.
In case of withholding of assent, the Governor is bound to follow the

    procedure prescribed under the first proviso and assent to the bill if it is

    ultimately presented to him for assent after being repassed by the State

    legislature. The Governor may also reserve certain bills for the consideration

    of the President. However, in no case has the Governor been conferred with

    the power to veto a bill which is presented to him. He is envisaged as an

    intermediary stop in the journey of the bill towards becoming an Act. When

    a bill comes to the Governor, he may forthwith assent to it, or postpone the

    grant of assent by exercising the option of withholding of assent but only for

    so long till the bill comes back to him after reconsideration, or he may

    forward the bill to the President whereupon the procedure prescribed under
Article 201
is to be followed. Thus, in none of these cases can the Governor

    permanently keep a bill with him without according assent to it, nor can he

    declare a simpliciter withholding of assent thereby killing the bill.
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 167 of 414
ii.    Whether the Governor can reserve a Bill for the consideration of the
       President when it is presented to him for assent after being
       reconsidered in accordance with the first proviso to
Article 200
, more
       particularly, when he had not reserved it for the consideration of the
       President in the first instance?
199. As discussed in the preceding issue, the Governor, in exercise of his powers

      under
Article 200
, has three options to choose from. The use of the

      conjunction “or” between the three options signifies that the options are

      mutually exclusive and once one of the options is exercised by the Governor,

      the other options become unavailable to choose from.
Kameshwar Singh
(supra) held that there can be no reservation for the consideration of the

      President once assent is declared and similarly, there is no requirement for

      the Governor to assent to the bill, once the bill, having been reserved for the

      consideration of the President, has received his assent.
204. However, for the sake of completeness, we deem it necessary to discuss a

    possible scenario wherein the Governor may have the power to reserve the
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 170 of 414
bill for the consideration of the President even after it is repassed by the State

    legislature and presented to him for assent. Say, for instance, in a particular

    case, the Governor withholds assent to a bill which is presented to him and

    returns it to the House or the Houses together with a message requesting

    them to reconsider certain aspects of the bill or introduce certain

    amendments desirable thereto. However, the House or the Houses, in the

    process of reconsideration, introduce certain changes which were not

    suggested by the Governor in the message which he sent together with the

    bill. In such a scenario, the House or Houses cannot be said to have

    “reconsidered the Bill accordingly” which is a mandatory condition

    prescribed under the first proviso. If the bill which is presented to the

    Governor for assent in the second round could be said to have been

    reconsidered by the House or Houses on wholly different and new grounds,

    and if those changes are of such a nature where a reservation for the

    consideration of the President may be desirable, then the Governor would

    not be precluded from reserving the bill for the consideration of the

    President.
205. However, if the bill is repassed by the House or Houses without

    amendments, or only with such amendments as were suggested by the

    Governor in his message, then the procedure prescribed under the first

    proviso could be said to be fully complied with and the Governor would be
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                         Page 171 of 414
bound to signify his assent thereto and would be precluded from reserving

     the bill for the consideration of the President.
207. As we shall also discuss later, any reservation of a bill by the Governor for

     the consideration of the President on the ground that the bill was not

     reconsidered as per the procedure prescribed in the first proviso would be

     subject to judicial scrutiny.
208. Coming to the facts of the present case, out of twelve bills which are the

     subject matter of the present petition, two were reserved by the Governor for

     the consideration of the President in the first instance of their presentation.
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 172 of 414
As regards the remaining ten bills, the Governor declared a withholding of

    assent, however, the bills were returned without any message as is envisaged

    under the first proviso. What stands out as a glaring omission on the part of

    the Governor is that the day on which the withholding of assent was

    declared, the decision in
State of Punjab
(supra) had already been passed

    and even the notice in the present petition had been issued. Thus, it was

    expected of the Governor that he would not declare a simpliciter withholding

    of assent of the bills without specifying the reasons for such withholding and

    also without making recommendations as regards the desirability of

    introducing any amendments by the State legislature while reconsidering the

    bills.
210. In the absence of any message under the first proviso by the Governor, the

    State legislature was left with no other option but to proceed on the

    assumption that the bills were required to be reconsidered in its entirety. The
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 173 of 414
State legislature proceeded on this assumption and the said 10 Bills were

       reconsidered in a special sitting and were passed without any material

       changes and presented to the Governor on the same day. Thereafter, the

       Governor, rather than giving his assent to the Bills, went on to reserve the

       Bills for the consideration of the President on the ground that the Bills were

       repugnant to Entry 66 of the List I of the Schedule VII to the Constitution.
211. For the reasons that we have assigned in our foregoing discussion, we are of

       the view that the Governor could not have reserved the Bills for the

       consideration of the President once they were reconsidered by the State

       legislature and presented to him without any amendments, particularly when

       the Governor sent back the Bills to the State legislature without any message

       on an earlier occasion. As a natural consequence of the reservation of the

       bills for the consideration of the President having been found to be in

       contravention of the procedure prescribed under
Article 200
of the

       Constitution and thus, illegal and void, any subsequent decision taken by the

       President on those Bills would also be non-est and is thus declared to be void

       ab-initio.
215. The arguments advanced before us present an interesting question whether

    it would be open to the courts to read in a time limit for the exercise of a

    power by a constitutional authority where no such limit is prescribed by the

    Constitution. We have expressly held during the course of answering the

    previous issue that the scheme of
Article 200
does not envisage either the

    exercise of a pocket or an absolute veto by the Governor. The use of the

    expression “shall” in the substantive part indicates that the Governor is

    under an obligation to choose from one of the three options that are made

    available to him. By virtue of the first proviso attaching itself to the option

    of withholding of assent, as discussed earlier, the possibility of an absolute

    veto is also ruled out as the Governor must assent to the bill once it is

    presented to him after the procedure prescribed in the first proviso is

    complied with.
The experience of the working of the Constitution, more particularly,
Article

     200
, has shown that the apprehensions expressed by some of the members

     of the Constituent Assembly have unfortunately proven to be prophecy. As

     we have discussed in the preceding paragraphs, one of the prominent

     grievances of the State governments as recorded by the Sarkaria

     Commission and Punchhi Commission reports was that the exercise of the

     power under
Article 200
by the Governor, not being a time-bound process,

     leads to significant legislative delay and that certain bills are withheld in the

     Governor’s secretariat for years.
225. Not taking any action on the bills for an unreasonable and prolonged period

     of time virtually vests the Governor with the power of pocket veto and the

     same cannot be held to be permissible within our constitutional scheme. Dr.

     Singhvi had submitted during the course of his arguments that there is no

     scope for the Governor to decide not to decide.
Article 200
, being the final

     step in the process of the birth of a legislative enactment, the stage wherein
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 181 of 414
life is breathed into an otherwise lifeless document, cannot be interpreted in

    a manner which allows the Governor to remain silent and exhibit inaction

    upon the bills which are submitted to him after having received the approval

    of the majority of the State legislature.
20. Under the Cabinet system of Government
                 as embodied in our Constitution the Governor
                 is the constitutional or formal head of the State
                 and he exercises all his powers and functions
                 conferred on him by or under the Constitution
                 on the aid and advice of his Council of
                 Ministers, save in spheres where the Governor
                 is required by or under the Constitution to
                 exercise his functions in his discretion.
242. When prescribing such a time-limit for the exercise of power under
Article

     200
, we are guided by the inherent expedient nature of the procedure

     prescribed thereunder and the well-settled legal principle that where no time-

     limit for the exercise of a power is prescribed, it should be exercised within

     a reasonable period.
243. What would be a reasonable period would vary from situation to situation,

     however, in the present case, taking guidance from the timelines that have

     been prescribed by the Sarkaria and the Punchhi Commission, we have

     arrived at the view that in the absence of any exceptional circumstances, the

     Governor would be able to exercise his powers under the Article within the

     maximum period prescribed by us.
246. We also deem it necessary to prescribe a timeline for the discharge of

     functions by the Governor under
Article 200.
The Sarkaria and Punchhi

     Commissions in their reports adopted this view, keeping in mind the

     importance of an expeditious decision under
Article 200
for the smooth

     functioning of electoral democracy in the States. An elected government
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                     Page 208 of 414
gets the mandate of the people for a limited period of five-years within which

    it is expected to legislate on issues pertaining to the electorate. If the

    Governor, for whatsoever reasons, exhibits reluctance or lethargy in

    decision making, particularly when it is concerned with the assent to bills, it

    severely impacts the ability of the government to act upon its mandate and

    deliver to the people who brought them into power. Any obstacle created by

    the Governor, whether advertently or inadvertently, severely impacts the

    perception of the elected government in the subsequent elections and thereby

    also negatively affecting their chances of coming back into power. The

    problem is further exacerbated when the political party in power in the State

    is different from the one at the Centre, and the Governor should be more

    cautious and non-partisan in the exercise of his functions in such a scenario.

    Any deliberate inaction on part of the Governor in assenting to bills or

    reserving them for the consideration of the President, thus, has to be viewed

    as a serious threat to the federal polity of the country and the aggrieved

    governments cannot be left remediless, desperately waiting for a decision at

    the hands of the Governor.
249. We have already discussed that in
Keisham
(supra), a three-Judge Bench

    of this Court fixed an outer time-limit of three-months for the Speaker to

    decide disqualification petitions under the Tenth Schedule. The Court

    pertinently observed that the said period was fixed “keeping in mind the fact

    that ordinarily the life of the Lok Sabha and the Legislative Assembly of the

    States is five-years”. This Court has also, in a number of decisions, set down

    and reiterated that the High Courts must pronounce judgments on reserved

    matters within a period of six-months. Inaction on part of any constitutional

    authority being subject to judicial review, it is important that there are

    reasonably laid down standards of justiciability of such inaction, and the

    timelines prescribed by us serve that purpose. Even the Constituent

    Assembly had initially laid down a period of six-weeks for the President to

    take action on bills submitted to him under
Article 111.
However, that was

    later changed to account for any exceptional circumstance that may arise in

    the discharge of functions by the President or the Governor. However, the

    expression “six-months” was replaced with “as soon as possible”, which

    though not determinable, envisages an expeditious disposal of bills, unless

    in cases where some impossibility exists. The prescription of timelines by

    us balances the objective of expediency as well as the desirability of having

    some flexibility in cases of existence of an impossibility in discharge of
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 211 of 414
functions in an expeditious manner. Flexibility in the discharge of a function

     cannot be allowed to be stretched to an extent that renders the very object

     underlying such function otiose, resulting into the proverbial snapping of the

     constitutional machinery.
262. One of the key decisions that the framers of the Constitution had to take was

     to decide the mode of selection of the Governor - whether he should be

     elected by way of a direct election, or selected from a panel of names

     suggested by the State legislature, or nominated by the President. While in

     the early days, the Constituent Assembly leaned towards having an elected

     Governor, as the framing of the Constitution neared its conclusion, there was

     increasing support in favour of having a Governor nominated by the

     President. Jawaharlal Nehru attributed this shift of opinion to the bitter

     experience of partition, which, according to him, opened the eyes of the

     Constituent Assembly to the dangers of separatism and the need for having
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 217 of 414
a political structure which focused more on the character of the nation as a

        Union of States rather than a federation.
263. The speeches made by some of the members of the Constituent Assembly

        on
Article 155
of the Constitution broadly encapsulate the ideas which were

        debated and rejected before nomination was selected as the mode of

        appointment for the Governor.
264. Speaking in favour of appointment of Governors by Presidential nomination,

        Shri. H.V. Kamath was of the opinion that the concept of an elected

        Governor would undermine the structure of the country as a Union of States,

        since a Governor elected directly by the people on the basis of adult suffrage

        would place more emphasis on India being a federation. However, according

        to him, “the emphasis today is more upon the Union pattern of our State

        than upon its Federal aspect”13. He believed that an elected Governor, being

        a partisan figure, would inevitably clash with the Chief Minister, thereby

        disrupting the functioning of a cabinet-style government. According to him,

        the role of a constitutional head should be impartial and symbolic, and the

        nomination system was better suited to uphold these principles. He further

265. Shri. Hukam Singh, opting for the middle path, acknowledged the

        difficulties inherent in both pure election and pure nomination for the

        purpose of appointment of Governors. While agreeing with Shri. H.V.

        Kamath on the drawbacks of an elected Governor, such as the potential for

conflict with the Chief Minister and the high costs involved in conducting

    elections, he proposed a balanced alternative, suggesting that a panel of

    candidates be nominated by the State legislature and a Governor be chosen

    from the said panel. This method, while allowing for some discretion would

    also ensure public accountability since the merits of those individuals who

    had been recommended in the panel would be publicly available and if the

    right person was not chosen, then the selection would also be criticized

    publicly. In his view, this approach would reduce favoritism, enhance

    transparency, and provide a safeguard against the abuse of power, striking a

    middle ground between the extremes of election and direct nomination.
266. Shri. Rohini Kumar Chaudhari opposed the nomination of Governors,

    cautioning that a Centre-appointed Governor belonging to a different

    political party than the provincial government could lead to discord and

    undermine provincial autonomy. The friction that would result from

    adopting a system wherein Governors are elected would also exist,

    according to him, when a Governor is nominated, since the nominee of the

    President would not work in harmonious tandem with the Ministry of the

    State which belongs to a different political party than the one which enjoys

    power at the Centre. He argued that electing Governors would ensure that

    they are more attuned to the needs of all communities, including

    marginalized groups like tribal populations in States where the Governor
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                    Page 220 of 414
would have an even more important role to play. He criticized the reliance

        on British precedents and advocated for a more democratic process, such as

        election or selection from a panel, to reflect the will of the people and to also

        safeguard provincial interests.
267. Shri. Alladi Krishnaswami Ayyar was of the view that since the Governor is

        merely a constitutional head of the province and the real executive power

        had been vested in a ministry responsible to the Lower House of the different

        States, it seemed rather unnecessary, under such circumstances, to adopt the

        method of election based on universal suffrage for the appointment of the

        Governors. The nomination of Governors by the President would, in his

        opinion, mitigate constitutional conflicts and foster harmonious relations

        between the Governor and the provincial Cabinet. He argued that an elected

        Governor, deriving authority from universal suffrage, might assert

        dominance over the Cabinet, leading to significant constitutional risks. He

        specifically remarked that, “In the normal working of the Government also

        there is danger of a clash between the Minister and the Governor, whereas the

        whole basis of the constitutional structure we are erecting depends upon the

        harmony between the legislature and the executive, and between the executive

        and the formal head of the Government”.15 Drawing inspiration from the

W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 221 of 414
Canadian model, he suggested that the President’s appointment of

        Governors, guided by the advice of the provincial Cabinet, would ensure

        stability and sound governance. Furthermore, according to him, “Nowhere

        does the system of election of the Governor exist where the Institution of

        responsible government is the main feature of the Constitution”.16 He believed

        that this system would better serve the interests of the provinces and the

        nation as a whole.
268. It was his belief that while the method of nomination was the most

        appropriate one, a convention of appointing Governors in consultation with

        the State government would grow. This, when read with the other

        discussions which took place in the Constituent Assembly, indicate that the

        framers of the Constitution reposed trust that the Governor would not be a

        cipher of the Central government, would be a person above party politics

        and would not attempt to override the State government with his actions. He

        also supported the idea of having nominated Governors on the ground that

        the intervention of the Governor would be required only in extraordinary

        situations, and an elected Governor may come in conflict with the provincial

        Cabinet by trying to override their decisions. His words are reproduced

        below:
269. Shri. P.S. Deshmukh was of the opinion that there exist a few fundamental

        considerations which have to be kept in mind while discussing the

        appointment of the Governor. The first of these fundamental considerations

        was that, “if we decide that the Governor should be elected by the province

        on the basis of adult franchise, then it follows logically that he should be a

        real executive authority. On the other hand, if you want him to be mere

        figurehead, if you want him to have exactly the same position as he has today

        under the 1935 Act and which is exactly the position which is assigned to

        him under the Draft Constitution, you cannot but have him appointed by the

        President.”17. In light of this, he buttressed his view that Governors must be

        nominated and not elected. Regarding the concern that adopting a system of

        nominating the Governor would give undue power to the Prime Minister and

        the President, he opined that the Prime Minister would also be a popular

        Prime Minister and that he can only be there as long as he has the support of

        the Parliament elected by the people at large. Therefore, his view was that

        we must not hesitate in giving powers of patronage to the Prime Minister or

        the President. He also expressed concerns about the potential discord
17
8, CONSTITUENT ASSEMB. DEB., (May 30, 1949) 433.
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 225 of 414
the President to disallow provincial bills directly by overriding the assent of

        the Governor within a certain prescribed period of time from the date of such

        assent, rather than relying on the Governors as intermediaries who refer the

        bill for the consideration of the President, would centralize responsibility

        with the Central Executive and reduce conflicts at the provincial level. In his

        view, this approach would align with the principles of responsible

        government and ensure smoother governance.
277. Shri. Brajeshwar Prasad was not in favor of the amendment that was put

        forth since he was of the opinion that the Governor should be vested not only

        with the power to act in his discretion but also with the power to act in his

        individual judgement. He was of the view that there was a dearth of

        leadership in the provinces wherein competent men were not available and

        unless the Governor is vested with large powers, it would be difficult to

        effect any improvement in the provincial administration. He went to the

        extent of saying that though such a procedure may be considered as

        undemocratic, it would be in the interest of the country. He remarked that,

        “I cannot allow democracy to jeopardize the vital interests of the country

        […] The masses who ought to be the rulers of this land are down-trodden

        and exploited in all ways. Under these circumstances there is no way left

        open but for the Government of India to take the Provincial administrations

        in its own hands”22. In his opinion, federalism could not succeed in a country

        which was passing through a transitory period and therefore, he subscribed

        to the view that power must be vested at the Centre and as a natural corollary,

        the Governor must be able to act in his discretion.
278. Shri. Mahavir Tyagi was also in agreement with the view that the Governor

        must be granted discretion. In his opinion, the State must be kept linked

        together with the Centre and the Governor would be the agent who guards

        the Central policy in the provinces/States. There would be certain subject-

        matters which affect the whole body politic and the provinces/States cannot

        be left free of the policy at the Centre. Since the policy which is evoked in

        the Centre must be followed by all the States, and if the Governors were to

        be in the hands of the provincial Ministers, then there will be various policies

        in various provinces and ministers of various types having different party

        labels and programmes would push their own agenda. Therefore, it was his

        view that, “The Governor being the agency of the Centre would be the only

        guarantee to integrate the various provinces/States”23. According to him,

        this is why the Governor’s discretionary powers should not be interfered

        with. He went on to remark that democratic trends are like a wild beast and

        that it goes by the whims and fancies of the parties and the masses. There

        must be some machinery which would keep this wild beast under control. It

        is in such a reality that the Governor exercising his discretion acts as a

        guardian of the Central policy on one side and the Constitution on the other.

W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 233 of 414
transcend party politics and he would look at the Minister and the State

government from a detached standpoint. He would also be able to influence

the ministers and members of the legislature in such a manner that the

administration would run smoothly. In such a circumstance, to say that he is

merely a dummy, an automaton or a dignitary without powers would be

gravely wrong. According to his conception of a constitutional Governor,

the Governor would have to accept the advice of his ministers in many

matters but there may also exist many other matters in which such an advice

will either be unavailable or wherein he will not be bound to accept that

advice. Another illustration, according to him, of when the Governor would

act in his discretion would be under draft
Article 147 (
Article 167
as it stands

today) where the Governor can exercise his power of calling for certain

information from the Chief Minister. Under this Article, the Governor is

competent to ask the Chief Minister to place any matter before the Council

of Ministers which only one minister might have decided. When he calls for

such information, he will be acting in the exercise of his discretion and may

call for any kind of information with a view to control and restrain the

ministry from undertaking irresponsible acts. Therefore, he remarked that,

“In my opinion taking the Governor as he is conceived to be under the
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 234 of 414
Constitution, he will exercise very important functions and therefore it is

        very necessary to retain the words relating to his discretion in article 143”25.
283. Shri. Rohini Kumar Chaudhuri put forth the alternate view that it is always

        better to be governed by the will of the people than to be governed by the

        will of a single person who could act in his discretion. He remarked that, “If

        this Governor is given the power to act in his discretion there is no power

        on earth to prevent him from doing so. He can be a veritable King Stork.”26.

        Furthermore, the draft
Article 143
itself states that wherever the Governor

        thinks that he is acting in his discretion, he cannot be questioned. According

        to him, in this day and age, we must not countenance such a state of affairs.
285. He conveyed that the Canadians and the Australians had not found it

        necessary to delete these provisions even in this day and age and that they

        were quite satisfied with its retention. This, he argued, was demonstrative of

        the fact that the grant of such a discretion to the Governor is fully compatible

        with a responsible government. If they had felt otherwise, they had the

        fullest right to abrogate this provision and would have done so. Therefore,

        the existence of a provision vesting a certain amount of discretion in the

        Governor cannot be questioned. Furthermore, the draft Article reads that,

        “Except in so far as he is by or under this Constitution” and not that “except

        wherever he thinks that he should exercise this power of discretion against

        the wishes or against the advice of the ministers”28. Therefore, the clause is

        very limited in nature and would have to be read in conjunction with such
27
8, CONSTITUENT ASSEMB. DEB., (Jun. 1, 1949) 500.
154. We declare the law of this branch of our Constitution to
        be that the President and Governor, custodians of all
        executive and other powers under various articles shall, by
        virtue of these provisions, exercise their formal constitutional
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 249 of 414
powers only upon and in accordance with the advice of their
        Ministers save in a few well-known exceptional situations.
        Without being dogmatic or exhaustive, these situations relate
        to (a) the choice of Prime Minister (Chief Minister),
        restricted though this choice is by the paramount
        consideration that he should command a majority in the
        House; (b) the dismissal of a Government which has lost its
        majority in the House, but refuses to quit office; (c) the
        dissolution of the House where an appeal to the country is
        necessitous, although in this area the head of State should
        avoid getting involved in politics and must be advised by his
        Prime Minister (Chief Minister) who will eventually take the
        responsibility for the step. We do not examine in detail the
        constitutional proprieties in these predicaments except to
        utter the caution that even here the action must be compelled
        by the peril to democracy and the appeal to the House or to
        the country must become blatantly obligatory. We have no
        doubt that de Smith's statement [ Constitutional and
        Administrative Law — by S.A. De Smith — Peguin Books on
        Foundations of Law] regarding royal assent holds good for
        the President and Governor in India:
32. If, on these facts and circumstances, the Governor cannot
        act in his own discretion there would be a complete
        breakdown of the rule of law inasmuch as it would then be
        open for Governments to refuse sanction in spite of
        overwhelming material showing that a prima facie case is
        made out. If, in cases where a prima facie case is clearly
        made out, sanction to prosecute high functionaries is refused
        or withheld, democracy itself will be at stake. It would then
        lead to a situation where people in power may break the law
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 254 of 414
with impunity safe in the knowledge that they will not be
             prosecuted as the requisite sanction will not be granted.”

                                               (Emphasis supplied)
149. In our considered view, a clear answer to the query
        raised above, can inter alia emerge from the Constituent
        Assembly Debates with reference to draft
Article 143
, which
        eventually came to be renumbered as
Article 163
in the
        Constitution. It would be relevant to record that from the
        queries raised by H.V. Kamath, T.T. Krishnamachari, Alladi
        Krishnaswami Ayyar, and from the response to the same by
        Dr B.R. Ambedkar, it clearly emerges that the general
        principle with reference to the scope and extent of the
        discretionary power of the Governor, is provided for through
Article 163(1).
It also becomes apparent from
Article 163(1)
,
        which provides for the principle of Ministerial Responsibility.
        The crucial position that gets clarified from a perusal of the
        Constituent Assembly Debates, arises from the answer to the
        query, whether the Governor should have any discretionary
        power at all? The Debates expound, that the retention of
        discretionary power with the Governor was not, in any way,
        contrary to the power of responsible Government, nor should
        the same be assumed as a power akin to that vested with a
        Governor under the
Government of India Act, 1935
. And from
        that, emerges the answer that the retention and vesting of
        discretionary powers with the Governor, should not be taken
        in the sense of being contrary to, or having the effect of
        negating the powers of responsible Government.
Clause (2) of
Article 254
obviates that consequence where
        the law has been reserved for the consideration of the
        President and has received assent.
Article 254(1)
is made
        subject to clause (2), thereby emphasising that the assent of
        the President will cure a repugnancy of the State law with a
        law enacted by Parliament in a matter falling in the
        Concurrent List. It is in this context, that the decisions of this
        Court hold that the assent of the President should be sought
        in relation to a repugnancy with a specific provision
        contained in a Parliamentary legislation so as to enable due
        consideration by the President of the ground on which assent
        has been sought.
Article 200
contains the source of the
        constitutional power which is conferred upon the Governor
        to reserve a Bill for the consideration of the President.
Article
        254(2)
is an illustration of the constitutional authority of the
        Governor to reserve a law enacted by the State Legislature
        for consideration of the President in a specified situation —
        where it is repugnant to an existing law or to a Parliamentary
        legislation on a matter falling in the Concurrent List. The
        eventuality which is specified in
Article 254(2)
does not
        exhaust the ambit of the power entrusted to the Governor
        under
Article 200
to reserve a Bill for the consideration of
        the President. Apart from a repugnancy in matters falling in
        the Concurrent List between State and Parliamentary
        legislation, a Governor may have sound constitutional
        reasons to reserve a Bill for the consideration of the
        President.
Article 200
, in its second proviso mandates that a
        Bill which derogates from the powers of the High Court must
        be reserved for the consideration of the President. Apart from
        Bills which fall within the description set out in the second
        proviso, the Governor may legitimately refer a Bill for
        consideration of the President upon entertaining a legitimate
        doubt about the validity of the law. By its very nature, it
        would not be possible for this Court to reflect upon the
        situations in which the power under
Article 200
can be
        exercised. This was noticed in the judgment of this Court
        in
Hoechst [Hoechst Pharmaceuticals Ltd. v. State of Bihar
,
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                         Page 266 of 414
(1983) 4 SCC 45 : 1983 SCC (Tax) 248] . Excluding it from
            judicial scrutiny, the Court held : (SCC pp. 100-101, para 86)

                 ‘86. [...] There may also be a Bill passed by the
                 State Legislature where there may be a genuine
                 doubt about the applicability of any of the
                 provisions of the Constitution which require the
                 assent of the President to be given to it in order that
                 it may be effective as an Act. In such a case, it is
                 for the Governor to exercise his discretion and to
                 decide whether he should assent to the Bill or
                 should reserve it for consideration of the President
                 to avoid any future complication. Even if it
                 ultimately turns out that there was no necessity for
                 the Governor to have reserved a Bill for the
                 consideration of the President, still he having done
                 so and obtained the assent of the President, the Act
                 so passed cannot be held to be unconstitutional on
                 the ground of want of proper assent. This aspect of
                 the matter, as the law now stands, is not open to
                 scrutiny by the courts. In the instant case, the
                 Finance Bill which ultimately became the Act in
                 question was a consolidating Act relating to
                 different subjects and perhaps the Governor felt
                 that it was necessary to reserve it for the assent of
                 the President. We have no hesitation in holding
                 that the assent of the President is not justiciable,
                 and we cannot spell out any infirmity arising out of
                 his decision to give such assent.’”

                                       (Emphasis supplied)
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                           Page 269 of 414
said to be present only in those cases where the Constitution has envisaged

a mandatory approval of the Government, before the law can become

enforceable in the State. The Sarkaria Commission mentioned three

categories where reservation of a bill for the consideration of the President

is envisaged:
This means that the Governor is made well aware of any legislation that the

     State government is planning to enact much before it is introduced in the

     State legislature and sent to him for assent. Thus, the advisory role of the

     Governor is best played by engaging with the Council of Ministers even

     before the legislation is introduced in the State legislature. He is well within

     his rights, and in fact, it is his bounden duty to put to use his experience and

     wisdom by making constructive suggestions to the Cabinet regarding the

     legislative proposals. The Council of Ministers would also do good to take

     into consideration the advice of the Governor and deliberate upon it so that

     the legislation and ultimately, public interest is benefitted.
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 271 of 414
310. As our discussion on the Constituent Assembly debates also reveals, the

    option of withholding of assent, was believed by the framers, would be

    invoked in very rare circumstances where the Council of Ministers discover

    some error in the legislation or desire to incorporate certain changes to it so

    as to meet with the popular opinion outside the House. The framers did not

    expect that the Governor would, as a matter of routine, declare the

    withholding of assent to bills casually. The deletion of the expression “in his

    discretion” from the first proviso is also an unmistakable indication of the

    intent of the framers in vesting no discretion in the Governor as regards the

    withholding of assent and returning of the bill along with suggestions for the

    introduction of amendments.
317. The Governor under the constitutional scheme is no longer envisaged as the

    Governor under the GoI Act, 1935, having the ultimate power to veto any

    legislation and subvert the collective will of the people being expressed

    through the legislature. If the power to withhold assent to bills or to reserve

    them for the consideration of the President is construed as falling within the

    exclusive discretionary domain of the Governor, who would be free to

    decide a course of action notwithstanding the aid and advice of the Council

    of Ministers, it would have the potential of turning him into a super-

    constitutional figure, having the power to bring to a complete halt, the

    operation of the legislative machinery in the State. The Governor cannot be

    vested with such a power, the exercise of which would enable him to collude

    with the Union Cabinet and ensure the death of any and all legislation

    initiated by the State merely by reserving it for the consideration of the

    President, who under
Article 201
is not bound to give assent to any

    legislation reserved for his consideration.
324. Essentially, the questions that fall for our consideration are as follows:
332. From the above exposition of law, it becomes clear as a noon day, that no

    exercise of power under the Constitution is beyond the pale of judicial

    review. Thus, we find no reason to exclude the discharge of functions by the

    Governor or the President under
Articles 200
and
201
of the Constitution

    respectively.
When public interest requires, this Court has to do its
            constitutional duties and to address the situation. However,
            this Court is of the opinion that such a situation would not
            arise to pass any order in this matter.”

348. We find it difficult to express our agreement with the view taken in
B.K.

    Pavitra
(supra) that the exercise of power to reserve a bill for the

    consideration of the President by the Governor is beyond the pale of judicial

    scrutiny, even in cases where it is exercised in his own discretion and against
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 311 of 414
the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers. We have discussed in the

previous sections of this judgment that the Governor under
Article 200
is

ordinarily expected to act in accordance with the aid and advice of the

Council of Ministers, and it is only in certain very exceptional situations that

he should resort to the exercise of discretion. Further, the limits of such

discretion are to be derived from
Article 163(1).
The exercise of such

discretion by the Governor, if excluded from judicial scrutiny, would

militate against the fundamental constitutional principle that exercise of all

power must be within the confines of the Constitution. Absolute exclusion

of judicial scrutiny would also confer upon the Governor an absolute power

to disregard the will of the people expressed through the State legislature

and government. While it is true that there may be situations in which the

exercise of discretion by the Governor under
Article 200
would be

permissible, this does not imply that this Court would be precluded from

determining the legality and propriety of the exercise of such discretion in a

given case. In fact, it is owing to the impossibility of the task of exhaustively

charting out such situations wherein discretion would be allowed to be

exercised, that it becomes all the more crucial for the power of judicial

review to exist with the courts. This would keep in line any bonafide action

on the part of the Governor which is disguised under the garb of legitimate

exercise of discretion.
349. The two-fold observations in
B.K. Pavitra
(supra) vesting the Governor with

     unfettered discretion to reserve bills for the consideration of the President

     under
Article 200
, and at the same time excluding such exercise of discretion

     from judicial scrutiny essentially has the effect of safeguarding the actions

     of the Governor in a lead casket which cannot be permeated even in cases

     of breach of the constitutional framework within which the Governor is

     expected to function.
77. The assent of the President or the Governor, as the case
        may be, is considered to be part of the legislative process only
        for the limited purpose that the legislative process is
        incomplete without them for enacting a law and in the
        absence of the assent the Bill passed could not be considered
        to be an Act or a piece of legislation, effective and
        enforceable and not to extend the immunity in respect of
        procedural formalities to be observed inside the respective
        Houses and certification by the presiding officer concerned
        of their due compliance, to areas or acts outside and besides
        those formalities. The powers actually exercised by the
        President, at any rate under
Articles 31-A
, 31-C
, 254(2)
and
304(b)
are a special constituent power vested with the Head
        of the Union, as the protector and defender of the
        Constitution and safety valve to safeguard the fundamental
        rights of citizens and federal structure of the country's polity
        as adopted in the Constitution. A genuine, real and effective
        consideration would depend upon specific and sufficient
        information being provided to him inviting, at any rate, his
        attention to the Central law with which the State law is
        considered or apprehended to be repugnant, and in the
        absence of any effort or exercise shown to have been
        undertaken, when questioned before courts, the State law
        cannot be permitted or allowed to have predominance or an
        overriding effect over that Central enactment of Parliament
        to which no specific reference of the President at all has been
        invited to. This, in my view, is a must and an essential
        requirement to be satisfied; in the absence of which the
        “consideration” claimed would be one in a vacuum and
        really oblivious to the hoard of legislations falling under the
        Concurrent List in force in the country and enacted by
        Parliament. To uphold as valid the claim for any such blanket
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 323 of 414
assent or all-round predominance over any and every such
             law — whether brought to the notice of the President or not,
             would amount to legitimization of what was not even in the
             contemplation or consideration on the basis of some assumed
             “consideration”. In order to find out the real state of affairs
             as to whether the “assent” in a given case was after a due
             and proper application of mind and effective
             “consideration” as envisaged by the Constitution, this Court
             as well as the High Court exercising powers of judicial
             review are entitled to call for the relevant records and look
             into the same. This the courts have been doing, as and when
             considered necessary, all along. No exception therefore
             could be taken to the High Court in this case adopting such a
             procedure, in discharge of its obligations and exercise of
             jurisdiction under the Constitution of India.”

                                              (Emphasis supplied)
357. We have given some thought to the observations made in the aforesaid

     decisions as regards the non-justiciability of the assent of the President. As

     per the settled principles of parliamentary democracy across the world, the

     grant of assent to legislations is construed as a power of the head of state

     which is to be exercised only upon the aid and advice of the Council of

     Ministers. As per
Articles 74(2)
and
163(3)
of the Constitution respectively,

     the question whether any, and if so what, advice was tendered by the

     Ministers to the President or the Governor, shall not be inquired into by any

     court. A perusal of
Articles 111
, 200
and
201
respectively makes it clear that

     no reasons are required to be provided by the President or the Governor for

     according assent to bills. However, if the President or the Governor exercise

     the option of withholding of assent under
Article 111
or 200 respectively,

     then there is a requirement to communicate the reasons for such withholding

     in the form of a message to the House or Houses of the legislature. Similarly,
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 326 of 414
as has been discussed with great emphasis in Kaiser-I-Hind (supra), if there

     is any reservation of Bills for the consideration of the President by the

     Governor, then the same must be reflected by way of a specific and clear

     reference providing details as to why the reservation has been made so as to

     enable the President to “consider” the desirability of according assent to the

     bill so reserved.
358. The grant of assent to a bill is an exercise which generally takes place on the

     aid and advice of the Council of Ministers, and assenting to the bill is the

     only practically possible course of action available to the constitutional

     heads in most of the common law jurisdictions. The grant of assent may not

     be justiciable because, there exists an unavailability of any material upon

     which the courts may be able to undertake a judicial scrutiny. However, the

     same would not be the case as regards the withholding of assent or

     reservation of the bill for the consideration of the President, which can only

     be exercised upon furnishing of detailed reasons for the same.
362. As described in Kaiser-I-Hind (supra), the role of the President under
Article 201
is a sui-generis one, tailor made to fit the quasi-federal

    constitutional scheme. The role of the Governor in reserving bills for the

    consideration of the President is also intrinsically linked with this constituent

    role of the President. It was also observed that the grant of assent is

    considered a legislative act only for the limited purpose that without it a bill

    cannot become law and also for extending immunity to certain formalities

    to be followed within the legislature. This immunity does not extend to other

    aspects of the legal procedure which fall beyond the ambit of these limited

    formalities. Thus, compliance with the prescribed legislative procedure

    leading up to assent is open to judicial scrutiny in appropriate cases. Further,

    as we have discussed in the preceding paragraphs, the reservation of bills for

    the consideration of the President by the Governor is warranted only in

    certain limited situations.
200. Our discussion on the scope of discretion available to the Governor
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                     Page 330 of 414
makes it clear that the Governor exercises discretion in a very limited

    domain when discharging his functions under
Article 200.
He may reserve

    the bills for the consideration of the President only for achieving certain

    predetermined purposes and his personal views, disliking for the policy, or

    the views of the Union government are not grounds on which he may reserve

    a bill under
Article 200.
The nature of constitutional function prescribed for

    the Governor under
Article 200
being such, the exercise of such function

    can be subjected to judicial review on the standard of being within

    constitutional bounds. Reserving a bill for the consideration of the President

    is a part of the legislative procedure and must invariably be subjected to

    judicial review in cases where the constitutionally prescribed procedure is

    not complied with, or misused.
366. As a logical sequitur of the above, any exercise of
Article 201
in a manner

     which does not align with this fundamental object underlying
Article 201
would be liable to a greater degree of judicial scrutiny. Thus, wherever a bill

     which falls within the exclusive domain of the State legislature is being

     referred to the President for his consideration on the ground that it attracts

     one of the exceptional situations where the Governor may exercise his

     discretion as mentioned in paragraph 300 of this judgment, it would not be

     open to the President to withhold assent without ascribing reasons as regards

     the doubt raised by the Governor to such a bill. In such a case, the ideal

     course for the President would be to obtain legal opinion as regards the bill,

     in appropriate cases, by making reference to this Court under
Article 143
,

     and only thereafter declare the grant or withholding of assent. Where the

     grounds of withholding of assent are not concerned with policy areas in

     which the Union has primacy, the courts would have a greater degree of
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 332 of 414
judicial scrutiny. We say this because on questions of legality, it is the

    constitutional courts which have been conferred with the power of arriving

    at a final decision and the object of
Article 201
is not to thwart the legislative

    procedure of the States by withholding of assent even in areas falling within

    the exclusive domain of the States on grounds of legality.
(iii)    Where the reservation of a bill by the Governor for the

             consideration of the President is on the grounds of peril to

             democracy or democratic principles or on other exceptional

             grounds as mentioned in M.P. Special Police (supra) and

             Nabam Rebia (supra) then the Governor would be expected to
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 335 of 414
make a specific and clear reference to the President properly

             indicating the reasons for entertaining such a belief by

             pinpointing the specific provisions in this regard and the

             consequent effect that may ensue if such a bill were to be

             allowed to become a law. The Governor while making such a

             reference should also indicate his subjective satisfaction as to

             why the aforesaid consequences that may ensue cannot be

             possibly curtailed or contained by taking recourse to the

             constitutional courts of the country. It shall be open to the State

             Government to challenge such a reservation on the ground of

             failure on part of the Governor to furnish the necessary reasons

             as discussed aforesaid or that the reasons indicated are wholly

             irrelevant, mala-fide, arbitrary, unnecessary or motivated by

             extraneous considerations. This being a question completely

             capable of being determined by the constitutional courts, would

             be fully justiciable.
(iv)     Reservation of a bill on grounds other than the ones mentioned

             above, such as personal dissatisfaction of the Governor,

             political expediency or any other extraneous or irrelevant

             considerations is strictly impermissible by the Constitution and

             would be liable to be set-aside forthwith on that ground alone.
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 336 of 414
This will also encompass reservation of a bill by the Governor

                after having already exercised the option of withholding of

                assent in terms of
Article 200
except in such exceptional

                circumstance as mentioned in paragraph 204 of this judgment.
(v)         Where the Governor exhibits inaction in making a decision

                when a bill is presented to him for assent under
Article 200
and

                such inaction exceeds the time-limit as has been prescribed by

                us in paragraph 250 of this judgment then it shall be open to the

                State Government to seek a writ of mandamus from a

                competent court against the Governor directing expeditious

                decision on the concerned bill as is the mandate of the

                Constitution, however, it is clarified that the Governor may

                successfully resist such a challenge on providing sufficient

                explanation for the delay caused.
369. We clarify that the possible situations illustrated by above are not meant to

      be exhaustive and in the specific facts of a given case, the courts may evolve

      new standards of judicial scrutiny to ensure that the constitutionally

      prescribed procedure is adhered to in letter and spirit.



vi.    What is the manner in which the President under
Article 201
of the
       Constitution is required to act once a Bill has been reserved for his
       consideration by the Governor under
Article 200
of the Constitution?
375. Any symptoms of lethargy exhibited by the State legislature which is the

    recipient of a bill sent after the procedure under
Article 201
is adopted, is

    viewed strictly by the Constitution. Here, inaction by the State legislature or

    delayed action by them in terms of repassing of the bill would cause the bill

    to “fall through” instead. The consequences of the failure to act promptly

    and in a punctual manner is more grave and severe for the State legislature

    under
Article 201
since the premise is that the occasion for the reservation

    of a bill for the consideration of the President by the Governor may arise

    where a constitutional provision makes the assent of the President a

    condition precedent to a State legislation becoming enforceable or for the

    purpose of conferring some immunity upon the State legislation. Such a

    requirement can be found in
Articles 31A
, 31C
, 254(2)
, 288(2)
, 360(4)(a)(ii)
etc. The second proviso to
Article 200
also makes reservation for the

    consideration of the President mandatory. As we have also discussed, there

    may be certain other legitimate situations where the Governor may, in
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 344 of 414
exercise of his discretion, reserve a bill for the consideration of the

    President. The matters attracting the aforesaid provisions require the

    procedure in
Article 201
to be initiated since they pertain to areas wherein

    the Centre could be said to have precedence or an edge over the State

    governments. This is because the considerations herein involve questions

    pertaining to the larger economic policy of the Union, safeguarding the

    fundamental rights of citizens and maintaining the integrity of the country

    as a whole. For example, the uniformity of policy across States for matters

    falling under the Concurrent List would be a valid arena wherein the interest

    of the Union might need to be paid heed to in comparison with those of the

    States. Hence, a higher degree of the power of scrutiny of the President

    would be implicit in such matters and he, having consulted the Union

    Council of Ministers, could be said to have the final say which has the effect

    of overriding those wishes of the State legislature.
378. It is in such a background and context that the prescription of the six-month

         time limit upon the State legislature for re-passing the Bill and presenting it

         before the President for his consideration assumes more significance. Non-

         adherence or any absence of deference to this time-limit would prove to be

         detrimental to the cause of the State itself since the balance of power is

         inherently skewed in favour of the Union on such matters. Having said so,

         and also conscientiously discussed by us in the preceding paragraphs, this is

         why the reference by the Governor of bills for the consideration of the

         President must be strictly by and under the strength of clear provisions of

         the Constitution.
Owing to this, a number of bills enacted by the legislatures of various

         States remain pending with the President awaiting a decision.

      b. There being no obligation upon the President to mandatorily assent to a

         bill under
Article 201
, if a bill is reserved for the consideration of the

         President by the Governor acting in his discretion, then it has the effect

         of rendering the enactment of the bill by the State legislature nugatory,

         if the President keeps the bill pending with him or declares the

         withholding of assent to such a bill.
385. At this juncture, we deem it apposite to refer to the office memorandum

     issued by the Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India dated

     04.02.2016 to all the Ministries/Departments of the Government of India

     regarding the expeditious disposal of State bills reserved for the assent of

     the President. The same is reproduced hereinbelow:
386. The aforesaid memorandum indicates that the procedure involved after a

    reference is made to the President by the Governor is that the Union Ministry

    of Home Affairs as the nodal Ministry would refer the substantive issues

    involved in the bill to the appropriate Ministry at the Centre which is

    concerned with the subject matter and issues pertaining to the bill’s

    language, drafting or constitutional validity to the Law Ministry at the

    Centre. In this process, the Office Memorandum lays down strict guidelines

    directing the concerned Central Departments or Ministries that the

    objections or views that they may have to the bill must be meaningful and
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 353 of 414
precise. Such a stipulation has been laid down because the making of

    unreasonable queries or observations only serves to delay the entire process

    of consideration of a bill by the President under
Article 201.
The Ministry

    concerned with the substantive issues as regards the bill is required to

    communicate their views to the Home Ministry within 15 days from the date

    of receipt of the bill. If there is a deviation from the said time restriction,

    they must assign reasons for the delay that has ensued on their part. The

    failure to indicate so within a maximum period of one month, is construed

    strictly and understood to mean that the concerned Ministry may have no

    comments whatsoever to offer on the proposal. A perusal of the aforesaid

    also makes it clear that a timeline of three months has been prescribed for

    the decision on bills reserved for the President. A time limit of three weeks

    has been prescribed for the disposal of ordinances of an urgent nature.
398. The mandate for an effective and purposeful dialogue has been

    constitutionally recognised and approved through the proviso to
Article 201.
Making the exercise of this proviso optional or subjecting it to the discretion

    of the President to use wherever and whenever he deems fit would deprive

    the States of an important safeguard which has been clearly
laid down in
the

    Constitution. Although we are not oblivious to the fact that the Office

    Memorandums referred by us above provide an opportunity for the State
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 363 of 414
government to respond to the objections that the concerned Ministry at the

    Centre may have, we must remember that such an Office Memorandum

    cannot be used to bypass a procedure already
laid down in
the text of the

    Constitution. Furthermore, the sending of objections and receipt of

    clarifications to and from the State government while the proposed bill is

    under consideration of the President through the concerned Ministry at the

    Centre, is to enable and infuse an informed decision making in the entire

    process to avoid any haste or non-application of mind, before taking any

    decision of either grant of assent or withholding thereof in the first place.
405. However, if he chooses to withhold his assent, the bill will not take birth as

     law. It must, however, be noted that even during the withholding of assent

     of a bill received on the second round, the President would be required to

     assign clear and sufficiently detailed reasons for arriving at such a decision.
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 367 of 414
Even in the second round, he has no power whatsoever to exercise absolute

    veto, as the Constitution does not provide anywhere that withholding of

    assent can be done simpliciter. Hence, the decision to choose the option of

    withholding assent after having set into motion the proviso to
Article 201
must not be misconstrued to mean that he is exercising an ‘absolute veto’ or

    a power of a similar nature. We say so because first, the decision has not

    been arrived at in the first instance without communicating reasons to the

    State legislature and providing them with an opportunity to reconsider the

    bill, and secondly, the President is mandated to declare the withholding of

    assent to the repassed bill with cogent and sufficient reasons at this stage as

    well.
5.10.04
Articles 31A(1)
, 31C
, 288(2)
and
304(b)
provide for
        reservation of certain types of State Bills for the
        consideration and assent of the President. These provisions,
        read with Article 201—, enable the Union Executive to
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                         Page 369 of 414
ensure, on the basic aspects of these special matters, a
        certain degree of uniformity in the interests of the social and
        economic unity of the country. Examination of the State Bills
        of this special category, from the point of their compatibility
        with the settled policy of the Union, therefore, does not
        involve any impropriety.
President should not withhold assent merely on
        consideration of policy differences with respect to matters
        in List II


        5.10.05 Apart from all such matters on which a measure of
        uniform coordinated policy is desirable, there remains in List
        II an area which is purely of local or domestic concern to the
        States. It is with respect to Bills falling within this area of
        exclusive State concern that utmost caution, circumspection
        and restraint on the part of the Union Executive is required
        in the exercise of its supervisory powers under Article 201—
        . This is all the more necessary if the Bill has been reserved
        by the Governor in the exercise of his discretion, contrary to
        the advice of his Ministers. It may not be prudent to veto such
        a Bill merely on the ground that the legislative policy of the
        Bill, though otherwise constitutional, does not conform with
        what the Union Government thinks should be its policy with
        respect to the subject-matter of the Bill.
407. Where the ground of reservation of a bill is patent unconstitutionality of a

     nature described in the exceptional situations in M.P. Special Police (supra),

     that is where the bill upon becoming law would be a peril to democracy, the

     decision of the President must be guided by the fact that it is the

     constitutional courts that have been conferred with the ultimate authority of

     interpretation of the Constitution and the laws.
408. When a legislation is apprehended to be patently unconstitutional of the

     nature described in the above paragraph, the courts as the sentinel on qui

     vive have been empowered by the Constitution to test the vires of such

     legislation and there is no bar or limitation to the power of judicial review

     of the courts in this regard. This is in consonance with the constitutional

     scheme of checks and balances between the three wings of the Government

     so as to ensure that absolute power does not vest in one authority. Therefore,

     the power of judicial review by design acts as more than a sufficient

     safeguard against the enactment of an unconstitutional legislation by the

     legislature.
409. However, in cases of challenge to legislations duly passed by the legislature

     and assented to by the executive, the constitutional courts temper their

     judicial review with the presumption that such legislation is constitutional.

     This is because the courts deem it appropriate to not interfere with an
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 371 of 414
enactment that has been passed in the wisdom of the legislature and

     symbolises the political will of our people. It is in this context, that we find

     it worthwhile to note the remarks of the eminent constitutional jurist, Nani

     Palkhivala on the object of assent by the executive to a bill – “The object of

     enacting these provisions [
Articles 200
and
201]
was perhaps that while the

     constitutionality of a law can be challenged in a court, its wisdom cannot be

     and that it would be better to prevent a clearly unconstitutional legislation

     from becoming law than to have it invalidated by a court later.” However,

     the aforesaid statement should not be construed devoid of its context, more

     particularly in ignorance of
Article 143
of the Constitution which we shall

     now discuss.
410. We are in agreement that one of the object of
Article 201
is also to prevent

     a bill that is perilous to democratic principles. However, we are also of the

     view that a bill appearing to be unconstitutional must be assessed by a

     judicial mind. It is for this reason that both the Sarkaria Commission and the

     Punchhi Commission categorically recommended the President to seek the

     opinion of this Court under
Article 143
in respect of bills that may be

     apprehended to be patently unconstitutional.
411.
Article 143
confers on the President the power to consult this Court any time

     when it appears to the President that a question of law or fact has arisen, or
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 372 of 414
is likely to arise, which is of such a nature and of such public importance

     that it is expedient to obtain the opinion of this Court upon it. Therefore, the

     President is not just precluded but constitutionally expected to refer the

     question of vires of a bill to this Court as the apex judicial institution to

     ascertain the constitutionality thereof and accordingly enable the President

     to take action in respect of the said bill under
Article 201.
412. We are of the considered view that although the option to refer a bill to this

     Court under
Article 143
may not be mandatory, yet the President, as a

     measure of prudence, ought to seek an opinion under the said provision in

     respect of bills that have been reserved for the consideration of the President

     on grounds of perceived unconstitutionality. This is all the more necessary

     as there is no mechanism at the State level for the Governor to refer bills to

     the constitutional courts for their advice or opinion thereupon. Under the

     scheme of the Constitution as we see it, there is only one possible way for

     the Governor to ascertain the palpable constitutionality of a bill, which is by

     way of reserving it for the consideration of the President who in turn is then

     expected to invoke
Article 143.
The Constitution is not a maze, but a

     labyrinth. Although both may semantically appear to be one and the same,

     yet there is a very fine but discernible difference between the two. The

     difference lies in the fact that in a maze one may lose their way within the

     multiple overlapping paths, with the possibility of each of them leading to a
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 373 of 414
dead-end, however in a labyrinth one eventually finds the way and in the

    process also come out more enlightened. Similarly, any questions emanating

    from the Constitution or pertaining thereto such as the constitutional vires

    of a law must be uncovered through the foresightedness of our Constitution.

    Wherever, a bill is reserved by the Governor for the President on the ground

    of patent unconstitutionality of the nature wherein the exercise of discretion

    by the Governor is permissible under
Article 163(1)
, the Constitution

    expects the President to be the soothsayer, easing the sails for the Governor.
413. This very same constitutional obligation cast on the President is also

    provided in Article 154H of the Constitution of Sri Lanka wherein if the

    Governor is of the opinion that a statute enacted by a provincial council is

    unconstitutional, then he may refer the bill to the President who in turn is

    obligated to make a reference to the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka for

    obtaining pronouncement on the constitutional vires of such bill. Where the

    Supreme Court holds the statute to be constitutional, then the Governor is

    bound to grant assent. A similar framework is followed in the Republic of

    Kiribati where Section 66 of the Constitution of Kiribati allows the

    Beretitenti, who is the constitutional head of the State, to withhold assent to

    a bill only if he believes that such bill is inconsistent with the constitution.

    In such a case, he may return the bill back to the Parliament however, if the

    bill is passed again then the only option left with the Beretitenti is to either
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 374 of 414
assent or to refer its vires to the High Court for a declaration. If the court

    declares the bill to be constitutional then the assent must be granted

    forthwith.
417. It is in such situations that the court has to be mindful as to whether the

     reference received from the President under
Article 143
pertains to pure

     legal questions regarding interpretation of the Constitution or questions that

     are in the nature of a policy consideration. In case of the latter, the Supreme

     Court, having regard to the relevant facts and circumstances, can refuse to

     express its advisory opinion upon being satisfied that the questions presented

     to it are purely socio-economic or political questions and have no relation to

     the Constitution.
422. A lack of reasons or even insufficiency thereof may do violence to the

     concept of ‘limited government’ on which the edifice of our Constitution

     has been built. The whys and wherefores of the President’s actions provide

     a basis for judicial review and allow the courts to assess the validity of the

     decision as well as ensure accountability between the three pillars of

     government which is in consonance with the idea of checks and balances in

     the constitutional set-up of our country.
423. In this context, we are of the considered view that the expression of intention

     by the President through a declaration of reasons supporting his actions

     under
Article 201
is of paramount importance and this Court is not inhibited

     in any manner to make a presumption that the President and by extension,

     the Central government, may not have acted in a bona fide manner at the

     time when it exercises its powers of judicial review.
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 380 of 414
430. Coming to the facts of the present case, the Governor first withheld the ten

     bills under question and later despite the said Bills being repassed by the

     State legislature and presented before him again under the first proviso to
Article 200
, still reserved them for the consideration of the President. We

     have elaborated in detail that owing to the clear language in which the first

     proviso is couched, there would never arise, except in extraordinary

     situations, any occasion for the Governor to reserve a reconsidered bill for

     the consideration of the President. The said bills, in the absence of any

     message given by the Governor under the first proviso, were taken up for

     reconsideration by the State Assembly and passed in their original form, and

     presented to the Governor for his assent. Thus, undoubtedly, it was not open

     to the Governor to reserve the bills for the consideration of the President and

     he ought to have granted assent.
431. Considerable time has elapsed since these ten Bills were originally passed

     and presented to the Governor for assent. Two out of the ten Bills even date

     back to 2020. It is important to keep in mind that the tenure of the State

     legislature is of five years and the representatives are accountable to their

     electorate as regards the enactment of legislations addressing the issues

     faced by the electorate. At the end of every five years, the elected

     representatives have to go back to their electorate and provide a report card,

     based upon which the people, in whom the ultimate sovereignty rests, cast

     their votes. Bills, if kept pending for long despite their passage by the State

     legislature, militate against this very fundamental, essential to the

     sustenance of a representative democracy based on direct elections.
432. The conduct exhibited on part of the Governor, as it clearly appears from the

     events that have transpired even during the course of the present litigation,

     has been lacking in bonafides. There have been clear instances where the

     Governor has failed in showing due deference and respect to the judgments

     and directions of this Court. In such a situation, it is difficult for us to repose

     our trust and remand the matter to the Governor with a direction to dispose

     of the bills in accordance with the observations made by us in this judgment.
Article 142
empowers this Court to do complete justice and in the facts of

     the present case, more particularly, in light of the fact that the option of

     granting assent to the repassed bills was the only constitutionally permissible
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                          Page 385 of 414
option available with the Governor, we deem it absolutely necessary and

     appropriate to grant that very relief by exercising our extraordinary powers.

     No meaningful purpose would be served by keeping the bills, some of which

     have already been pending for incredulously long periods, pending for more

     time. Therefore, we deem the assent to have been granted.
433. Constitutional authorities are creatures of the Constitution and are bound by

     the limitations prescribed by it. No authority, in exercise of its powers, or to

     put it precisely, in discharge of its duties, must attempt to breach the

     constitutional firewall. The office of the Governor is no exception to this

     supreme command. Whenever there is an attempt by any authority to move

     beyond the bounds of the Constitution, this Court has been entrusted with

     the responsibility to act as the Sentinel on the qui vive and bring back the

     authority within the constitutionally permissible limits by exercising judicial

     review. We are not exercising our power under
Article 142
in a casual

     manner, or without giving a thought to it. On the contrary, it is only after

     deepest of deliberations, and having reached at the firm conclusion that the

     actions of the Governor - first in exhibiting prolonged inaction over the bills;

     secondly in declaring a simplicter withholding of assent and returning the

     bills without a message; and thirdly in reserving the bills for the President

     in the second round - were all in clear violation of the procedure envisaged

     under the Constitution, that we have decided to declare the deeming of
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 386 of 414
assent to the ten bills, considering it to be our constitutionally bounden duty.
(XX)     Whenever, in exercise of the powers under
Article 200
of the

         Constitution, a bill is reserved for the consideration of the President

         on grounds of patent unconstitutionality that are of such a nature so

         as to cause peril to the principles of representative democracy, the

         President, must be guided by the fact that it is the constitutional
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 399 of 414
courts which have been entrusted with the responsibility of

         adjudicating upon the questions of constitutionality and legality of

         an executive or legislative action. Therefore, as a measure of

         prudence, the President ought to make a reference to this Court in

         exercise of his powers under
Article 143
of the Constitution.



(XXI)    Judicial review and justiciability are not synonymous concepts. The

         power of judicial review in a written constitution is implicit. Unless

         expressly excluded by a provision of the Constitution, the power of

         judicial review is available in respect of exercise of powers under

         any of the provisions of the Constitution. On the other hand,

         justiciability relates to a particular field falling within the purview

         of the power of judicial review.
(iii)    Where the reservation of a bill by the Governor for the

                     consideration of the President is on the grounds of peril

                     to democracy or democratic principles or on other

                     exceptional grounds as mentioned in M.P. Special

                     Police (supra) and Nabam Rebia (supra) then the

                     Governor would be expected to make a specific and

                     clear reference to the President properly indicating the

                     reasons for entertaining such a belief by pinpointing the
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 404 of 414
specific provisions in this regard and the consequent

                     effect that may ensue if such a bill were to be allowed

                     to become a law. The Governor while making such a

                     reference should also indicate his subjective satisfaction

                     as to why the aforesaid consequences that may ensue

                     cannot be possibly curtailed or contained by taking

                     recourse to the constitutional courts of the country. It

                     shall be open to the State Government to challenge such

                     a reservation on the ground of failure on part of the

                     Governor to furnish the necessary reasons as discussed

                     aforesaid or that the reasons indicated are wholly

                     irrelevant,   mala-fide,   arbitrary,   unnecessary    or

                     motivated by extraneous considerations. This being a

                     question completely capable of being determined by the

                     constitutional courts, would be fully justiciable.
(iv)     Reservation of a bill on grounds other than the ones

                     mentioned above, such as personal dissatisfaction of the

                     Governor, political expediency or any other extraneous

                     or irrelevant considerations is strictly impermissible by

                     the Constitution and would be liable to be set-aside

                     forthwith on that ground alone. This will also
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 405 of 414
encompass reservation of a bill by the Governor after

                     having already exercised the option of withholding of

                     assent in terms of
Article 200
except in such exceptional

                     circumstance as mentioned in paragraph 204 of this

                     judgment.
437. The Governor before he assumes office undertakes an oath to discharge his

    functions to the best of his ability in order to preserve, protect and defend

    the Constitution and the rule of law, along with avowing to devote himself

    to the service and well-being of the people of the State. Therefore, it is

    imperative that all his actions be guided in true allegiance to his oath and

    that he faithfully executes his functions that he is entrusted with by and under

    the Constitution. There is a reason why a specific reference is made to the

    well-being of the people of the State in his oath, there is a reason why he is

    sworn in to pledge himself to the service of the same people; the Governor

    as the constitutional head of the State is reposed with the responsibility to

    accord primacy to the will and welfare of the people of the State and

    earnestly work in harmony with the State machinery, as his oath not only

    makes this mandate anything but clear but rather also demands it of the

    Governor owing to the intimate and delicate nature of the functions that he

    performs and the potency of the ramifications that could ensue or be

    unleashed upon the State. Due to this, the Governor must be conscious to

    not create roadblocks or chokehold the State Legislature in order to thwart

    and trade the will of the people for political edge. The members of the State

    Legislature having been elected by the people of the State as an outcome of

    the democratic expression are better attuned to ensure the wellbeing of the

    people of the State. Hence, any action contrary to the express choice of the
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 410 of 414
people, in other words, the State legislature would be a renege of his

    constitutional oath.
438. Before we part with the matter, we find it apposite to observe that

    constitutional authorities occupying high offices must be guided by the

    values of the Constitution. These values that are so cherished by the people

    of India are a result of years of struggle and sacrifice of our forefathers.

    When called upon to take decisions, such authorities must not give in to

    ephemeral political considerations but rather be guided by the spirit that

    underlies the Constitution. They must look within and reflect whether their

    actions are informed by their constitutional oath and if the course of action

    adopted by them furthers the ideals enshrined in the Constitution. If the

    authorities attempt to deliberately bypass the constitutional mandate, they

    are tinkering with the very ideals revered by its people upon which this

    country has been built.
439. We take this opportunity to quote Dr. B.R. Ambedkar’s concluding speech

    in the Constituent Assembly, which is as relevant today as it was in 1949 –

    “However good a Constitution may be, it is sure to turn out bad because

    those who are called to work it, happen to be a bad lot. However bad a

    Constitution may be, it may turn out to be good if those who are called to

    work it, happen to be a good lot”.
440. It is our duty as the highest constitutional court to recognize such evil and

     increasingly strengthen our initiative to remove them. In the last, we may

     say with the utmost responsibility and all the humility at our command that

     it is only when the constitutional functionaries exercise their powers by and

     under the Constitution that they show deference to the people of India who

     have given the Constitution to themselves.
442. We would also like to refer to a snippet of history from the days of infancy

     of the Constitution and the Indian Republic, which has been narrated in the

     “Eminent Parliamentarians Monograph Series on Dr. Rajendra Prasad”
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 412 of 414
published by the Lok Sabha Secretariat in 1990 (pp. 102). In the matter

    concerning the constitutional role of the President in legislative processes,

    an issue arose during the deliberations on the Hindu Code Bill, wherein the

    first President of India, Dr. Rajendra Prasad, expressed reservations and

    sought to assert his independent authority to withhold assent to the

    legislation. A reference was made to the first Attorney General for India,

    M.C. Setalvad, who clarified that the role of the President under the Indian

    Constitution was analogous to that of the British monarch and he was

    expected to serve as a constitutional figurehead. The Attorney General

    opined that the President does not possess the authority to act contrary to the

    advice of the Council of Ministers. The opinion of the Attorney General was,

    with respect and magnanimity, accepted by the President and thus the

    ensuing controversy between the Prime Minister and the President was laid

    to rest.","241. What emerges from the above is that the fine but pertinent distinction

     between the time-limits that are expressly prescribed and those that are

     judicially evolved is only that in the former the consequence of deemed

     assent emanates from the provision itself whereas in the latter there could be

     no such consequence except to the extent that the courts judicially reviewing

     the action or inaction can direct a decision to be taken within a time-bound

     manner, or in exceptional cases like the one at hand, deem the assent to have
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 206 of 414
been granted under
Article 142
of the Constitution, which we shall again

     discuss in the later parts of this judgment.
271. Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru emphasized the need to foster unity and avoid

        separatist tendencies within the nation. He believed that an elected Governor

        could exacerbate provincial divisions and weaken ties with the Centre. In his

        opinion, “Nevertheless a certain convention and practice helps or hinders

        the growth of separatist tendencies. I feel that if we have an elected

        Governor that would to some extent encourage that separatist provincial

        tendency more than otherwise. There will be far fewer common links with

        the Centre.”19 He argued that duplicating the electoral process for the office

        of Governor would be unnecessary and counterproductive, leading to

        conflicts, wastage of resources, and disruptive tendencies. Supporting the

        nomination of Governors, he asserted that this approach would align with
19

282. Pandit Thakur Das Bhargava adopted the notion that the Governor “shall be

        a guide, philosopher and friend of the Ministry as well as the people in

        general, so that he will exercise certain functions some of which will be in

        the nature of unwritten conventions and some will be such as will be

        expressly conferred by this Constitution.”24 The Governor’s role would

     respectively and the guidelines framed by the Central government taken

     collectively indicate the expediency involved in the disposal of references

     under
Article 201
along with the importance of the role of the President. In

     this backdrop, it must be made clear that the Courts would not be powerless

     to intervene in cases where the exercise of function by a constitutional

     authority is not being done without a reasonable time.

     Ministry of Home Affairs in the aforesaid guidelines, and prescribe that the

     President is required to take a decision on the bills reserved for his

     consideration by the Governor within a period of three months from the date

     on which such reference is received. In case of any delay beyond this period,

     appropriate reasons would have to be recorded and conveyed to the

     concerned State. The States are also required to be collaborative and extend

     co-operation by furnishing answers to the queries which may be raised and

     consider the suggestions made by the Central government expeditiously.


394. We say so because the scheme under which the constitutional heads of both

    the country and the State respectively are required to operate, does not

    contemplate the idea of an ‘absolute veto’, thereby meaning that there can

    be no withholding of assent without furnishing of reasons. This is owing to
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 360 of 414
the fact that the simpliciter withholding of assent both by the President and

     the Governor would be impermissible within the fundamental principles of

     a constitutional democracy.








Securing uniformity and coordinating policy on the basic
        aspects of such matters in List II, having an interface with
        those in List I, cannot be extraneous to the functions
        exercised by the President in considering State Bills, under
Article 201.












vii.    On Exercise of
Article 142.

In our view, that is the only way to ensure that complete justice is done with

     the parties without any delay, and without possibility of any further delay

     due to any inaction on the part of the Governor, or lack of deference on his

     part to this judgment.

H.    CONCLUSION

               iii. Thirdly, to reserve the bill for the consideration of the

months;




(XIX)    The position of law is settled that even where no time-limit is

         prescribed for the exercise of any power under a statute, it should

         be exercised within a reasonable time. The exercise of powers by

         the President under
Article 201
cannot be said to be immune to this

         general principle of law. Keeping in mind the expedient nature of

         the provision and having regard to the reports of Sarkaria and

         Puncchi Commissions, as well as the Memorandum dated

         04.02.2016 issued by the Ministry of Home Affairs, we prescribe

         that the President is required to take a decision on the bills reserved

         for his consideration by the Governor within a period of three

         months from the date on which such reference is received. In case

         of any delay beyond this period, appropriate reasons would have to

         be recorded and conveyed to the concerned State.

443. Such was the commitment shown by the stalwarts to upholding the spirit of

    the Constitution.

444. We hope and trust that the Governor and the State Government would work

    in tandem and harmoniously keeping the interests and well-being of the

    people as their paramount consideration.

445. We direct the Registry to send one copy each of this judgment to all the High

     Courts and the Principal Secretaries to the Governors of all States.

     terms.

W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                                  Page 414 of 414","3.   The Legislature for the State of Tamil Nadu, between 13.01.2020 and

     28.04.2023, enacted and forwarded 12 Bills to the Governor for grant of

     assent as per
Article 200
of the Constitution. Even though the present

     Governor took charge of the office with effect from 18.11.2021, yet he did

     not take the necessary action on any of the said Bills forwarded to his office

     till October 2023. The petitioner, being aggrieved by the inaction on part of

     the Governor, had to ultimately file the present writ petition before this

     Court. The same was filed on 31.10.2023.
5.   The State Legislature, on 18.11.2023, convened a special session and

     repassed the 10 bills which were returned by the Governor after withholding

     of assent. The bills were passed without any material change and were

     forwarded to the Governor’s Secretariat on the same day for his assent in

     accordance with the first proviso to
Article 200.
This Court, in its order dated

     20.11.2023, noted that since the repassed 10 bills were pending with the

     Governor, the hearing of the writ petition be adjourned to 01.12.2023 and

     issued directions that this Court shall be apprised of the progress in the

     matter.
4.⁠ ⁠However, State Government placed the Bill again in the
             Legislative Assembly and after getting Assembly's
             endorsement, sent them again to the Hon'ble Governor on
             18.11.2023.
10. Upon the suggestion made by this Court, the Governor, on 12.12.2023 wrote

     to the Chief Minister for the State of Tamil Nadu inviting him to a meeting

     in an attempt to resolve the deadlock. The Governor and the Chief Minister

met on 30.12.2023, pursuant to which the Chief Minister submitted a

    representation summarising the following issues:
15. It is only upon the present writ petition being filed and issuance of notice

              that the Governor’s office started acting upon the files. The Governor, on

              01.12.2023, submitted the factual position regarding the bills, files and other

              cases pending with his office detailing the actions taken thereupon. The

              details of the files requesting for sanction to investigate and prosecute and

              the Governor’s actions thereupon are summarised below:
19. It is the case of the petitioner that it was represented before the Governor by

      way of various representations that as per
Regulation 3
of the Tamil Nadu

      Public Service Commission Regulations, 1954, the Commission shall

      consist of a Chairman and 14 Members. However, no heed was paid to such

      representations. The functioning strength of TNPSC was of four members

      on the date of filing of the present petition.
21. The Governor, on 27.09.2023, returned the said files with a note raising

     some queries regarding transparency in the selection process, tenure of the

     members to be appointed and credentials of the proposed candidates. The

     Governor clarified that as the queries raised by his office were not addressed

     by the petitioner, the proposal for appointment of the recommended

     candidates was being returned and the same was no longer pending before

     him. This happened on 26.10.2023.
24. On 29.06.2023, the Governor suo moto and contrary to the aid and advice of

     the State Council of Ministers recommended the dismissal and divestment

     of portfolio of Senthil Balaji, a minister in the Tamil Nadu Cabinet on the

     ground that he was arrested by the Enforcement Directorate and was in

     judicial custody. However, the Governor addressed another letter to the

     Chief Minister on the very same day informing that he had kept the dismissal

     of Senthil Balaji in abeyance till further communication in light of the advice

     of the Union Minister of Home Affairs that it would be prudent to seek the

     opinion of the Attorney General on the matter.
26. Accordingly, on 13.03.2024, the Speaker of the State Legislative Assembly

    declared that the disqualification ceased to operate with effect from

    19.12.2023. The Election Commission also withdrew the notification of

    vacancy for his constituency.
27. The Chief Minister wrote to the Governor on 13.03.2024 to swear in Dr. K.

    Ponmudy as a Minister and allot to him the portfolio of Higher Education.

    However, the Governor vide the letter dated 17.03.2024, declined the request

    stating that the conviction order was suspended from its operation by way

    of ‘interim relief’ granted by this Court which meant that the conviction

    against Dr. Ponmudy, though existent, had been made non-operative and not

    set aside. The Governor also stated that the re-introduction of Dr. K.

    Ponmudy in the Cabinet would be against “constitutional morality”.
vi)   The counsel while highlighting the facts of the case at hand,

         submitted that the Governor had returned the Bills with the remarks

         “I withhold assent” which amounts to a clear withholding as per the

         second option of the substantive part of
Article 200.
When these

         Bills were returned to the Legislative Assembly, the Bills only

         contained a signed endorsement by the Governor with the remarks

         “I withhold assent” and there was no message for reconsideration.
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                     Page 44 of 414
In such a situation of simpliciter withholding of assent, the State

           Legislative Assembly cannot be precluded from re-considering the

           Bill and re-passing the Bill as the exercise of the option of

           withholding of assent brings into operation the first proviso

           whereby such Bills have to be returned to the State Legislative

           Assembly.
51. A few years after the ideation of the Swaraj Bill, the demand for self-

    government further found expression in the Congress-League Scheme of

    1916 which was a result of deliberations of the committees constituted

    jointly by the Indian National Congress and the All India Muslim League.

    The document envisioned a federal polity - with Provincial Legislative

    Councils for the provinces and an Imperial Legislative Council at the
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 74 of 414
national level. It is pertinent to note that as per the scheme, the Governor

was envisaged as the head of the provincial government and any bill passed

by the provincial legislature had to mandatorily receive his assent before it

became law. Further, the document also conferred upon the Governor-

General the power of vetoing any law passed by the provincial legislature.

Any bill passed by the Imperial Legislative Council had to receive the assent

of the Governor-General before it became law. The relevant provisions in

the said document are reproduced hereinbelow:
i.       Concept of assent to bills as envisaged by certain historical documents
         drafted during the freedom struggle.
95. The Commission was of the opinion that it is necessary to indicate at least a

       broad outline of the principles that should guide the Governor in the exercise

       of discretion, if any, vested in him. It was observed that the evolution of

       rules and guidelines in this respect is especially important in order to

       reconcile the actions of the Governor in his capacity as an agent of the Centre

       and the head of the State Executive.
123. As regards the withholding of Presidential assent, the Commission laid great

     emphasis that the Union Government ought to communicate to the State

     government, the reasons therefor. It was noted that the Union Government

     should enter into the practice of discussing the issues present in the bill with

     the State Government and making an effort to present its point of view to

     the State Government with reasons.
129. However, as regional political powers grew at the State level, the role of the

     Governor came to be a point of contention between the Centre and States

     with the latter leveling allegations of partiality and lack of objectivity in

     exercise of the Governor’s discretionary powers. As a result, the

     Commission was enjoined with the task of providing recommendations for

     better working of the office of the Governor.J.B. PARDIWALA, J.

     seeking amendment of the prayers of the present writ petition and prayed for

     insertion of the following prayer:

    Governor to:

12. Out of the 10 Bills reserved for her consideration, the President withheld

              assent to seven Bills, granted assent to one Bill and is yet to consider the

              remaining two Bills.

13. The status of the Bills is summarized below:

14. Between 10.04.2022 and 15.05.2023, the Government of Tamil Nadu

of members in TNPSC and carrying out their appointments. The petitioner

     also sent reminders to the Principal Secretary to the Governor for acting on

     the files sent to the Governor’s office in this respect.

b) Justiciability and Judicial Review.

         legislation with a Central enactment are not of easy determination

         and the only method of discourse between the Governor and the
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 31 of 414
State Legislature is provided in the first proviso to
Article 200.
Hence, simpliciter withholding of assent without taking recourse to

         the first proviso ought to be rejected by the Courts and compliance

         with the first proviso ought to be mandated in every case of

         withholding of assent. Furthermore, issues of repugnance should be

         left for the constitutional courts to decide.

e) Reservation of bills for the consideration of the President.



Gubernatorial procrastination is a new phenomenon and requires

         judicial intervention for finding a new solution for it within the

         Constitutional framework.



ix)   He further submitted that the said observations in
B.K. Pavitra
(supra) should be interpreted to mean that even though the power

         under
Article 200
is entrusted to the Governor, yet such exercise of

         power can only be done with the aid and advice of the Council of

         Ministers of the State. The Governor has no independent discretion

         under the substantive part of
Article 200
for referring the bill for

         the consideration of the President. As is crystal clear from the

         Constituent Assembly Debates, there is no independent discretion

         vested in the Governor in exercise of his functions under
Article

         200
of the Constitution. Although the power of reserving Bills for

         the consideration of the President is a necessary channel for

         references under
Article 254(2)
to save the competence of the State

         Legislatures from being unduly restricted by the operation of the

         rule of repugnancy embodied in Clause (1) of the
Article 254
, yet

         such power is also subject to the aid and advice of the Council of

         Ministers.

If the answer is yes, then the Governor must reserve the Bill for

            the consideration of the President.

g) Malice in law and malice in fact


C.        ISSUES FOR CONSIDERATION
iv. Whether the scheme of
Article 200
of the Constitution envisages

            the exercise of ‘absolute veto’ or ‘pocket veto’ of a bill by the

            Governor?
i. Whether the reservation by the Governor, for the consideration of

           the President of the ten Bills which were repassed by the Tamil

           Nadu State Assembly and presented to the Governor on

           18.11.2023, is erroneous in law and hence liable to be set aside?



III)   Whether there is an express constitutionally prescribed time-limit
       within which the Governor is required to act in the exercise of his
       powers under
Article 200
of the Constitution?
iii. Whether a time-limit can be prescribed by this Court for ensuring

          that the exercise of power by the Governor under
Article 200
is in

          conformity with the object of expediency underlying the scheme of

          the said provision?
IV)   Whether the Governor in the exercise of his powers under
Article
      200
of the Constitution can only act in accordance with the aid and
      advice tendered to him by the State Council of Ministers? If not,
      whether the constitutional scheme has vested the Governor with
      some discretion in discharge of his functions under
Article 200?
i. How has the role of the Governor been envisaged under the

          constitutional scheme?
ii. Whether the Governor enjoys a certain degree of discretion in

          discharge of his functions in contrast to the President? What is the

          source of such discretion, if any?
iii. Whether the deletion of the expression “in his discretion” from
Article 175
of the Draft Constitution imply that the Governor has
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 63 of 414
no discretion available in the exercise of his powers under
Article

          200?
i. Whether the discharge of functions by the Governor under
Article

          200
of the Constitution in his discretion could be said to be immune

          from judicial review?
ii. Whether the withholding of assent by the President under
Article

          201
of the Constitution could also be said to be beyond the scope

          of judicial scrutiny?
i. Whether the decision of the President to withhold assent under
Article 201
of the Constitution could be said to be justiciable? If

               yes, what is the extent of justiciability that the courts can embark

               upon while undertaking judicial review of the exercise of powers

               by the President under
Article 201
of the Constitution?

        vested power in the hands of the Ministry to remedy a hasty action that they

91. One of the questions on which the Commission addressed itself was whether

    the Constitution provides for the exercise of any power by the Governor in

    his discretion that is, whether the Governor could exercise any of his

    functions without consulting the Ministry or contrary to the aid and advice

    tendered by the Council of Ministers.

101. To the limited extent of studying the issues arising from the exercise of

     powers under
Articles 200
and
201
respectively, the Commission addressed

     itself on the following broad points:

                consideration and assent for specific purposes

iii. Bills which may not specifically fall under any of the
                   above categories, yet may be reserved by the
                   Governor for President's consideration under Article
200.”

c.    Expediency in Disposal of Bills – Timelines Suggested by the
      Report of the Commission
within which the Governor should take a decision whether to
             grant assent or to reserve it for the consideration of the
             President;
142. The report of the Punchhi Commission advocated for the immediate

     implementation of the above-mentioned recommendations by way of a

     Constitutional Amendment.
26. Insofar as Money Bills are concerned, the power of the
        Governor to return a Bill in terms of the first proviso is
        excluded from the purview of the constitutional power of the
        Governor. Money Bills are governed by
Article 207
in terms
        of which the recommendation of the Governor is required for
        the introduction of the Bill on a matter specified in sub-
        clauses (a) to (f) of clause (1) of Article 199.”

                                           (Emphasis supplied)

321. The question which naturally follows is whether the exercise of discretion

    by the Governor, in the exceptional situations as discussed aforesaid, would

    be amenable to judicial review. The importance of this question lies in the

    high constitutional importance of the role which the Governor plays under
Article 200.
The Governor, by choosing to act in his discretion under
Article

    200
, has the power to thwart the entire legislative machinery of the State by

    reserving a bill for the consideration of the President. He also has the power

    to significantly delay the grant of assent to a bill by withholding assent and

    returning the same to the State legislature under the first proviso to
Article

    200
of the Constitution.31. Mr. Rakesh Dwivedi, the learned Senior Counsel appearing for the

     petitioner, made elaborate submissions on the following aspects:
The Governor could not have kept the Bills submitted to him
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 25 of 414
between the years 2020 and 2023 in a cold storage without taking

         any decision on them. The fact that he entered no discussion with

         the State Government or the Chief Minister in relation to the Bills

         submitted to him further indicates that the Governor exercised

         pocket veto in relation to the said Bills, thereby bringing the

         constitutional machinery to a standstill. He submitted that the

         substantive part of
Article 200
uses the expression “shall declare”

         which indicates that the function of the Governor is mandatory. The

         underlying objective of
Article 200
is to make a Bill operative as

         an Act. Therefore, the scheme of
Article 200
negates the possibility

         of engaging in inordinate delay or pocket veto.
ii)   The Governor failed to take note of the decision of this Court in

         State of Punjab (supra). Although the said decision held that the

         first proviso to
Article 200
attaches to the option of withholding

         assent, yet the Governor recorded a simpliciter finding of

         withholding assent without conveying any message to the State

         Legislature, as provided under the first proviso. He submitted that

         simpliciter withholding of assent by the Governor is also violative

         of
Article 14
which mandates that the exercise of Constitutional

         powers should be based on reason and transparency. The State

         Legislature must be told why the assent has been withheld so as to
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 26 of 414
enable it to reconsider the Bill. He further submitted that in the

          absence of any message, it would be open to the State Legislature

          to understand that the Governor wishes the entire Bill to be

          reconsidered.
iii)   On the facts of the present case, Mr. Dwivedi submitted that having

          recorded that the Bills submitted to him were intra vires of the State

          Legislature, it was not open to the Governor to reserve the Bills for

          the consideration of the President upon being repassed and

          presented again before him. He submitted that once the reservation

          of the Bills for the consideration of the President is found to be

          erroneous in law, any subsequent withholding of assent by the

          President would also be legally vitiated.
i)    Mr. Dwivedi submitted that no constitutional power vested in any

         authority, howsoever high, is beyond the powers of judicial review

         of the constitutional courts. The scope of judicial review may vary,

         but no power is beyond the purview of the courts. The Courts may

         exercise restraint, but that is not to say that if the power has been

         exercised unconstitutionally, manifestly arbitrarily, in breach of

         fundamental rights enshrined in Part III or any other provision of

         the Constitution, or in a mala fide manner, the courts would be

         prohibited from striking down the exercise of such power.
iii)   In light of the aforesaid, he submitted that the position of law as on

          date, as explained by several Constitutional Bench decisions, is

          clear that no exercise of Constitutional power is outside the ambit

          of judicial review. No power is absolute and non-justiciable. Hence,

          the power exercised under
Article 200
can also be examined by this

          court to discern any unconstitutionality.
c) Governor is required to act upon the aid and advice of the Council
   of Ministers.
iii)   He further submitted that the discretion of the Governor under the

          Indian Constitution is governed solely by
Article 163(1)
and the

          interpretation adopted by this Court has been such which does not

          make the Governor dominant over the Chief Minister, who is an

          elected representative of the people.
i)    He submitted that the exercise of power to withhold assent by the

         Governor is coupled with the duty of the Governor to comply with

         the procedure prescribed in the first proviso to
Article 200
and the
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 32 of 414
same has been recognised in the decision in
State of Punjab
(supra).
ii)    On the use of the expression “shall declare” in the substantive part

          of
Article 200
, he submitted that this expression in the main part of
Article 200
would, by necessary implication, require the Governor

          to mention the reasons for withholding the assent.
32. Dr. Abhishek Manu Singhvi, the learned Senior Counsel appearing for the

    petitioner, made detailed submissions broadly on the following aspects:
i)    Mr. Singhvi submitted that the relevant consideration at the end of

         the Governor when a bill is presented before him for assent broadly

         should be as follows:
i)    He submitted that the expression “as soon as possible” provided in

           first proviso to
Article 200
does not provide any strict time limit to

           be followed by the Governor to decide upon the Bills presented for

           assent, but that should not and cannot mean that the Governor can

           keep a Bill duly passed by the State Legislative Assembly

           “pending” for indeterminate periods. This course of action is

           inconsistent with the phrase “as soon as possible”.

            conduct of the parties, and the nature of the proceedings to

            examine the possibility of delay causing prejudice to a party.

             CBI/SIT/MMDA, Chennai, Tamil Nadu and Anr. reported in

             (2023) 8 SCC 257 wherein while dealing with the delay caused

             by the Governor in deciding remission matters, this Court

             exercised its powers under
Article 142
of the Constitution

             directing that the prisoner was deemed to have served the

             sentence.
iii)   Mr. Singhvi referred to Chapter V of the report of the Sarkaria

          Commission on Centre-State Administrative Relations wherein it

          was suggested that the Governor should make a declaration under
Article 200
within one month from the date on which the Bill is

          presented. He also referred to the Punchhi Committee Report on

          Centre-State Relations which recommended “maximum period of

          six months after Bill is presented” to be the time limit to be

          followed by the Governor under
Article 200.
v)    Lastly, he submitted that even if the decision in
Valluri Basavaiah

         Chowdhary
(supra) is interpreted as a binding precedent, still such

         interpretation of the
Article 200
would fall foul of the intention

         envisaged by the Constituent Assembly.
i)    He submitted that the Governor could be said to have committed

         violence to the constitutional framework by not adhering to the

         mandate under
Article 200
of the Constitution and has also

         attempted to render the present Writ Petition infructuous during its

         pendency.
96. Having discussed the discretion of the Governor in matters of constitutional

       decision-making at length, the Commission recommended that a specific

       provision should be inserted in the Constitution to enable the President to

       issue Instruments of Instructions to the Governors laying down guidelines

       or principles with reference to which the Governor should act including the

       occasions for the exercise of discretionary powers.
105. Discretion, in exercise of powers under
Article 200
, therefore, should be

     dictated by reason, actuated by good faith and tempered by caution.

     Discretionary functions should be performed in public interest and cannot

     be discharged at the dictation of any outside authority unless so authorized

     by and under the Constitution.
128. The Commission, inter alia, looked at the original scheme of the Centre-
iii.    Whether there is an express constitutionally prescribed time-limit
        within which the Governor is required to act in the exercise of his
        powers under
Article 200
of the Constitution?
212. It was argued by the petitioner that the Governor in exercise of his powers

     under
Article 200
is required to act promptly and the absence of any

     prescribed time period should not be construed as allowing the Governor the

     liberty to act on his own free will and volition. It was also submitted that

     the expression “as soon as possible” appearing in the first proviso places an

     obligation on the Governor to act promptly and with expedience.
220. Shri P.S. Deshmukh expressed his opposition to the amendment proposed

    by Dr. B.R. Ambedkar, deeming the suggested substitution of the words as

    unnecessary. He, on the other hand, argued that the original phrasing,

    particularly the expression “not later than six weeks”, ought to remain

    unaltered, as it established a precise time frame for the President to act

    accordingly. He further argued that this specific time frame mandated that

    the President must convey his decision to return the bill for reconsideration

    as expeditiously as possible, and in no event beyond six-weeks. He opined

    that preserving the words “not later than six weeks” was quintessential to

    ensure timely action, thereby preventing undue delays in the legislative

    process to send the bills back to the House(s) for reconsideration.
253. Mr. Rohatgi, learned Senior Counsel, submitted that the act of the Governor

      amounts to a subversion of the Constitution. He further emphatically

      submitted that it indeed amounted to a subversion of the Constitution.
257. The Attorney General, per contra, argued that while exercising his powers

    under
Article 200
, the Governor is discharging an important constitutional

    obligation, and even if he does not exercise individual discretion, he may

    still act against the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers if he is so

    required to, in the discharge of his constitutional duties.

other Articles which specifically reserve the discretionary power for the

    Governor. It must not be construed as a general clause which gives the

    Governor the power to disregard the advice of his ministers in any matter in

    which he finds that he could disregard their opinion.
322. It was contended by the petitioner that no exercise of power under the

    Constitution could be said to be beyond the scope of judicial review as every

    authority, howsoever high, is expected to perform its functions within the

    constitutional framework. It was submitted that if the exercise of powers by

    the Governor under
Article 200
is held to be outside the scope of judicial
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 282 of 414
review, then that would render him to be a super-constitutional figure in the

     State, who would be able to override the legislature and the government

     elected by the people, at his whims and fancies and without any checks and

     balance.22. The petitioner, on the other hand, has averred in its writ petition that such

     queries were against the established practices to the selection of

     constitutional posts and that the availability of the chairman and members in

     the TNPSC was essential to monitor and expedite various recruitment

     processes as well as promotions. Delays in appointments to the TNPSC

     resulted in non-availability of sufficient members, which detrimentally

     affected the functioning of the Executive.
30. In the aforesaid factual matrix, the petitioner have prayed for a declaration

     that the reservation of the bills by the Governor for the consideration of the

     President after they were repassed by the State Legislature and presented

     before him as illegal. Further, as a sequitur, the petitioner have prayed that

     the act of withholding of assent by the President be declared as void ab-

     initio. The petitioner have also prayed for a declaration that the simpliciter

     withholding of assent by the Governor without following the procedure

     prescribed in the first proviso to
Article 200
, be also declared to be illegal

     for being in contravention to the position of law as
laid down in
State of

     Punjab (supra). The petitioner have also prayed for a direction to the

     Governor to accord sanction for prosecution, take prompt decision on the

     pending files pertaining to grant of remission and to clear the proposal for

     appointment of members to the TNPSC.
200) presented before the Constituent Assembly. However,

         ultimately, the expression conferring discretion was dropped and
Article 200
came to be adopted in its present form. He submitted

         that the reason for this was explained by Dr. Ambedkar who said

         that there can be no room for the Governor to act on his discretion

         in a responsible form of government. Further, it was explained by

         Mr. T.T. Krishnamachari that the returning of the Bill to the

         Legislature will only be upon the advice of the Council of Ministers

         and not on the personal discretion of the Governor.
iii)   He submitted that the expression “shall not withhold assent

          therefrom” in the first proviso to
Article 200
takes away the option

          of reserving the Bill for the consideration of the President from the

          Governor when the Bill is repassed by the State Legislature and

          presented before him for assent. In support of his submission, he

          argued that the use of a negative expression renders the course of

          action prescribed as mandatory in nature. He further submitted that

          the phraseology of the first proviso to
Article 200
is different from

          the proviso to
Article 201
inasmuch as the latter does not oblige the

          President to mandatorily assent to the Bill after it has been repassed

          by the State Legislature and is presented before him again.

          Whereas, in contrast, the first proviso to
Article 200
is couched in

          a negative language and thus prohibits the Governor from taking

          any other recourse than granting assent.
i)     Mr. Dwivedi submitted that the power to reserve the Bill for the

          consideration of the President is not open ended. If specific

          provision of the Constitution does not require Presidential assent to

          the Bill passed by State Legislature, then such a Bill cannot be

          reserved for the consideration of the President.
ii)    He submitted that a further limitation on the power to reserve a Bill

          is that it can only be reserved on the aid and advice of the Council

          of Ministers and the Governor has no personal discretion in this

          matter.

, 31C
, 213
, 254
, 288
, 304(b)
, 360
and 6th

          Schedule are the only provisions which expressly require assent of

          President. It is only when these articles are attracted that the

          Governor can reserve the Bills for consideration of the President.

          In the exclusive domain of Legislation under the State List or List-

          II of the 7th Schedule of the Constitution, no assent of President is

          needed.
iii)   On the aspect of repugnancy, he submitted that the letter of the

          Governor informing that the Bills were being reserved for the

          consideration of the President fails to specify the Central law with

          which States Bills are repugnant. This indicates non-application of

mind. He submitted that in Kaiser-I-Hind Pvt. Ltd. and Anr. v.
iv)   On the aspect of reading in a time limit within the scheme of
Article

             200
, he submitted that an outer limit of 2 to 3 months needs to be

             stipulated by this court to obviate exercise of pocket-veto by the

             Governors. Delays of over 3 months needs to be curbed.
iv)   He further submitted that a decision is not an authority for what can

         be read into it by implication or by assigning an assumed intention

         of the judges and inferring from it a proposition of law which the

         judges have not specifically or expressly
laid down in
the

         pronouncement.
i)    On the aspect of the position of the President under
Article 201
, he

         submitted that the President is not required to mandatorily assent to

         the bill that is presented to him for his consideration after being

         repassed by the State Legislature, once such bill has been sent back

         by the President under the proviso to
Article 201
in the first

         instance.
ii)    It was submitted that
Article 201
does not contain the expression

          “shall not withhold assent therefrom” in the proviso unlike the first

          proviso to
Article 200.
He further submitted that this Court in

          Kaiser-I-Hind (supra) had held that the assent of the President

          envisaged under
Articles 31-A
, 31-C
, 254(2)
and
304(b)
of the

          Constitution respectively constitutes a distinct class and category

          of its own and is different from the assent envisaged under
Articles

          111
of the President or
Article 200
of the Governor. A bare perusal

          of
Article 201
indicates that even when the Houses of the State

          Legislature re-pass the Bill and present it for consideration in terms

          of the proviso to
Article 201
, there is no compulsion on the

          President to accord assent.
33. Mr. P. Wilson, the learned Senior Counsel, made extensive submissions on

    behalf of the petitioner. For the sake of brevity, we are recording only those

    submissions which are in addition to the points already canvassed by Mr.

    Dwivedi and Mr. Singhvi respectively:
35. Mr. Vikramjit Banerjee, the learned Additional Solicitor General, appeared

    for the respondents and submitted as follows:
General for the signification in the King’s name of the King’s
            assent.”
General has assented thereto and that assent has been
            signified by the Governor-General to, and published by the
            Governor.
74. On the 30th of July, 1949, Dr. B.R. Ambedkar moved an amendment, as

        discussed aforesaid, for the substitution of the first proviso under draft
Article 175
, which later came to be successfully adopted by the Constituent

        Assembly. While moving for the substitution and highlighting that

        predominantly three key changes were sought to be made to the first proviso,

        he remarked that the words “in his discretion” under the draft
Article 175
were sought to be deleted because it was felt that “in a responsible

        government, there can be no room for the Governor acting on discretion”3.

        Shri. Brajeshwar Prasad was not whole-heartedly in favor of the changes

        suggested to the first proviso and contended that they would strip the

        Governor of the power to veto a bill or reserve it for the consideration of the

        President, in his own discretion or initiative and he would be able to do so

103. The Commission observed that the rule is that the Governor shall perform

     his functions on the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers of the State

     and the exercise of discretionary powers by him is the exception. The

     Commission envisaged that discretionary powers of reservation of a bill

     under
Article 200
should be exercised by the Governor only in rare cases

     where a bill is patently unconstitutional in his opinion. However, the

     Governor should not act contrary to the aid and advice of the Council of

     Ministers merely because he, in his personal capacity, does not favour the

     policy embodied in the bill. The relevant observations of the Commission

     are reproduced below:
108.
Article 254(1)
saves the power of the State legislatures to make laws with

     respect to matters in the concurrent list from being automatically superseded

     by the operation of the doctrine of repugnancy.
Article 254(2)
allows a law

     enacted by the State legislature and repugnant to the central law on the same

     subject-matter, to operate and prevail in that State provided that such State

     law receives the assent of the President.
110. It was noted by the Commission that the assent by the President to the State

     bills had been withheld on certain occasions on the ground that the Union

     was contemplating a more comprehensive legislation on the same subject

     matter. However, withholding of assent on such a premise at the level of the

     Union may unnecessarily delay or defeat the measures sought to be taken by

     the State legislature. Since the Parliament retains the power to amend, vary

     or repeal such a State legislation, even after its enactment, by passing a

     subsequent law inconsistent therewith, the Commission recommended that

     Presidential assent should not ordinarily be withheld on the ground that the

     Union is contemplating a comprehensive law in future on the same subject-

     matter.
112. On the question of the Union Executive’s discretion to withhold assent to a

     State bill on the ground of non-conformity with its policy, the Commission

     sounded a note of caution saying that policy considerations should not

     ordinarily be treated as a valid ground for withholding Presidential assent.
Article 201
confers supervisory powers on the Union Executive to enable it

     to secure a broad uniformity across central and state legislations in the

     interests of the social and economic unity of the country. However, the said

     provision cannot act as a measure for the Union Executive to bring to a

     grinding halt a State bill by withholding assent thereto if such a bill does not

     conform to its policy in general.
113. Further, the Union Executive is required to exercise utmost caution,

     circumspection and restraint in the exercise of supervisory powers under
Article 201
, especially in respect of the bills on subject matters that fall

     within the State List. In this regard, the Commission recommended that as a

     matter of convention, the President should not withhold assent only on

     consideration of policy differences on matters relating, in pith and substance,

     to the State List, except on the grounds of patent unconstitutionality.
119. The question whether there was a requirement of introducing time-limits in
Article 201
was necessary or not was also looked into by the Commission.

     It was reiterated that streamlining the procedure of reserving a State bill for

     Presidential consideration and enabling a mechanism for high-level

     discussions between the Union and State at the stage of drafting such bill

     may effectively reduce procedural delays at the level of the Union

     Government. Nevertheless, it was recommended that the Union and State
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 116 of 414
Governments should adopt definite timelines for processing State bills and

    disposing of their references to the President.
121. With a view to ensure that the timelines so suggested are not frustrated by

     lack of clarity and comprehensiveness in a reference, the Commission

     underscored the importance of a self-contained communication by the

     President to the State legislature for clarification or reconsideration of the

     bill. It was emphasized that clarifications to be sought by way of the proviso

     to
Article 201
should not be piecemeal.
122. While the Commission noted the significance of clear timelines for the

     exercise of powers under
Articles 200
and
201
respectively, it did not

     recommend any amendments to the said Articles for introducing concrete

     time periods within the constitutional scheme and left its recommendations

     in this regard at the stage of conventions only.
136. The Commission further emphasized the necessity of prescribing time limits

     for the exercise of powers under
Articles 200
and
201
respectively in order
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 124 of 414
to ensure that discretionary powers are not exercised by the Governor or the

     President in a manner that undermines the State legislature and the will of

     the people.
154. By the introduction of the Constitution Act, 1986, the Sovereign began to

     act on the advice of the Executive Council which is the part of the executive

     branch of government. It states that a bill passed by the House of

     Representatives becomes law when the Sovereign or the Governor-General

     grants assent.
Section 3
of the Act states that the power conferred on the

     Governor-General are royal powers exercised on behalf of the Sovereign.

     These powers may be exercised either by the Sovereign in person or by the

     Governor-General. Additionally, any reference in an Act to the Governor-

     General in Council also includes the Sovereign acting with the advice and

     consent of the Executive Council. The Prime Minister-designate is

     appointed as the Executive Councillor and he advises the Governor-General

     to appoint other Councillors. Section 3A removes any discretion of the

     Sovereign or the Governor-General, stating that they may exercise a power

     on the advice and with the consent of the Executive Council.
156. It is said that the role of the Governor-General is to ensure due process – that

        the bill was passed in Houses following the procedure. He is not concerned

        with the contents of the legislation as the act of the Governor-General is

        executive. However, in the context of Governor (state level), the Court of

        Appeal in Eastgate v. Rozzoli, reported in (1990) 20 NSWLR 188, noted

        that while giving assent the Australian State Governor acts as a constituent

        part of the Parliament. If a bill is reserved for Queen’s pleasure, she acts

W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                          Page 137 of 414
upon the advice of Australian Commonwealth Ministers. The power to refer

     bills back to Parliament can be exercised only upon ministerial advice. At

     the states, the parliamentary officers seek State Governor’s assent.

     Ordinarily, the State Governors assent to bills without any ministerial

     advice, only South Australia endeavors to provide executive advice to the

     Governor.
173. He argued that in cases where the bill suffers from some gross and manifest

     unconstitutionality, the Governor need not invoke the procedure mentioned

     in the first proviso and it would be sufficient if he declares a simpliciter

     withholding of the bill. As a corollary, he submitted that the procedure

     prescribed under the first proviso may be followed by the Governor when

     he is of the belief that the bill, which is otherwise constitutional, may benefit

     from certain amendments and in such a case he may send a message to the

     State legislature suggesting certain amendments to the bill.
221. Shri H.V. Kamath vehemently opposed the amendment put forward by Dr.

    Ambedkar. Advocating for expeditious and timely action, he argued that,

    “in human nature, if you will permit me to say so, unless there is a

    compelling sense of duty or service, there is always a tendency to
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 179 of 414
procrastinate”.11 It was his opinion that such tendencies to procrastinate

        must be rooted out by infusing a standard of duty or service to ensure timely

        action on part of the President. He further opined that there exists no

        assurance that every President of India will consistently adhere to the

        principle of timely action in legislative processes. Therefore, according to

        him, it was very necessary that the “Constitution should provide specifically

        a time limit for a contingency of this nature”12. He believed the phrase “as

        soon as possible” to be vague, purposeless and meaningless, and argued that

        such vague phrases have no place in a provision of such an important nature.
254. He also submitted that there was no discretion available to the Governor

      under the scheme of
Article 200
of the Constitution and the only exception

      to the same was provided in the second proviso to
Article 200
itself. In other

      words, he contended that the Governor could only reserve a bill against the
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 213 of 414
advice tendered to him by the Council of Ministers, if the bill was of a

    description as provided in the second proviso. He submitted that in all other

    cases, the reservation of a bill for the consideration of the President had to

    take place strictly in accordance with the advice of the Council of Ministers.
256. Mr. Dwivedi, placing reliance on the deletion of the expression “in his

    discretion” from both the substantive part of
Article 200
as well the first

    proviso by the Constituent Assembly, proposed an even stricter

    interpretation of
Article 200.
He argued that the deletion of the expression

    “in his discretion” indicated that the intention of the framers of the

    Constitution was crystal clear that the Governor should have no semblance

    of discretion while exercising his powers under
Article 200
and he should

    act in accordance with the advice rendered by the Council of Ministers. He

    further submitted that it is not just reservation of the bills for the

    consideration of the President, but the grant of assent, as well as the decision

    to send the bill back to the State legislature together with a message upon
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 214 of 414
the withholding of assent, which must be taken strictly in accordance with

    the advice of the Council of Ministers.
existing Central Act on the vesting of evacuee
             properties but, his assent was sought for a
             different, specific purpose altogether”,

        would belie any such claim. Per contra, it would only
        reinforce the principle that the consideration as well as the
        decision to accord consent should be a conscious one, after
        due application of mind, relevant and necessary for the
        purpose. Though, submission of a thesis on the various
        aspects of repugnancy involved may not be the requirement,
        the reservation for “consideration” would necessarily
        obligate an invitation of the attention of the President as to
        which of the pre-existing Central enactments or which
        provisions of those enactments are considered or
        apprehended to be repugnant, with reference to which the
        assent envisaged in
Article 254(2)
is sought for. This becomes
        all the more necessary also for the reason that the
        repugnancy in respect of which predominance is sought to be
        secured must be shown to exist or apprehended, on the date
        of the State law and not in a vacuum to cure any and every
        possible repugnancy in respect of all laws — irrespective of
        whether it was in the contemplation or not of the seeker of the
        assent or of the President at the time of “consideration” for
        according assent.For the convenience of the exposition, this judgment is divided in the following

parts:
4. The Bill falls, mainly, within the scope of the following
             entries of the Union, State and Concurrent. Lists In the
             Seventh Schedule to the Constitution, namely-
25. In a similar case, Dr. K. Ponmudy, a minister in the Government of Tamil

     Nadu was convicted and sentenced by the Madras High Court against which,

     he filed an appeal before this Court. This Court, vide order dated 11.03.2024,

     suspended the conviction of Dr. K. Ponmudy from its operation keeping in

     view

particularly for the reason that he should not suffer disqualification from the

    office of Member of Legislative Assembly.
29. This Court heard the application on 22.03.2024 and expressed its displeasure

     at the reluctance of the Governor to accept the order of this Court dated

     11.03.2024 suspending the sentence of Dr. K. Ponmudy. This prompted the

     Governor to swear in Dr. K. Ponmudy as Minister in the State Cabinet and

     the I.A. was disposed of accordingly recording the same.

ii)   In furtherance of the aforesaid submission, he drew our attention to

         the decision in
S.R. Bommai v. Union of India
reported in (1994)

         3 SCC 1 wherein the justiciability of a proclamation under
Article

         356
was propounded.
He also relied upon the decisions of this

         Court in
Rameshwar Prasad v. Union of India
reported in (
2006)

         2 SCC 1 and Kihoto Holohan v. Zachillhu
reported in 1992 Supp

         (2) SCC 651 wherein the exercise of power of the Governor to

         invite the leader of the majority party to form government and the
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 28 of 414
power of the Speaker under the 10th Schedule to the Constitution

          were respectively held to be justiciable by this Court.
ii)    He submitted that this Court has been consistent in its approach

          while interpreting the constitutional provisions, more particularly
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                           Page 29 of 414
those that pertain to the Governor or the President, in light of the

          fundamental       principles   of   Parliamentary   democracy    and

          federalism. He placed reliance on the decisions of this Court in
Samsher Singh v. State of Punjab
reported in (1974) 2
SCC 831,

          S.R. Bommai
(supra), Nabam Rebia & Bamang Felix v. Dy.

          Speaker, Arunachal Pradesh Legislative Assembly reported in

          (2016) 8 SCC 1 in support of the aforesaid submission.
National Textile Corporation (Maharashtra North) Ltd. and Ors.

             reported in (2002) 8 SCC 182, a Constitution Bench of this Court

             held that the Central law with which repugnance exists must be

             pointed out by the proposal of State government specifically. Even

             the nature of repugnance should be stated so as to enable the

             President to consider the nature, extent, feasibility, practicality and

             desirability of assenting.
v)    Placing reliance on the Constitution Bench decision in
Samsher

         Singh
(supra), he submitted that although the executive power of

         the State is vested in the Governor yet it is actually carried on by

         the Ministers under the Rules of Business made under
Article

         166(3).
Further, the President or the Governor act on the aid and

         advice of the Council of Ministers with the Prime Minister as the

         head in the case of the Union and the Chief Minister as the head in

         the case of States, in all matters which vest in the Executive,

         irrespective of whether those functions are executive or legislative

         in character.
vi)   Referring to the observations made by a Constitution Bench of this

         Court in Nabam Rebia (supra), it was submitted that the Governor

         cannot be entrusted with such powers and functions as would assign

         to him a dominating position over the State Executive and the State

         Legislature. The Governor cannot be accepted as an all-pervading

         super-constitutional authority. It was submitted that an examination

         of the executive and legislative functions of the Governor in the
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 37 of 414
context of the constitutional scheme clearly brings out that the

         Governor has not been assigned any substantive role either in the

         executive or the legislative functioning of the State.
vii) It was argued that this Court in Nabam Rabia (supra) has gone

         further to say that any exercise of discretionary powers of the

         Governor is limited to situations where a constitutional provision

         expressly provides that the Governor should act in his own

         discretion. Additionally, a Governor may exercise his functions in

         his own discretion in situations where the constitutional provision

         concerned cannot be construed otherwise and in situations where

         the clear intent underlying a constitutional provision so requires

         i.e., where the exercise of such power on the aid and advice, would

         run contrary to the constitutional scheme, or would be contradictory

         in terms.
viii) In response to our specific question as regards the observations

         made by this Court in
B.K. Pavitra v. Union of India
reported in

         (2019) 6 SCC 129, that the eventuality in
Article 254(2)
does not

         exhaust the ambit of the power entrusted to the Governor under
Article 200
to reserve a Bill for the consideration of the President,

         he submitted that the Governor may legitimately refer a bill for
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                         Page 38 of 414
consideration at the end of the President upon entertaining a

         legitimate doubt about the validity of law. However, such reference

         of a bill can only be done with the aid and advice of the Council of

         Ministers and not upon the individual discretion of the Governor.
iii)   On the use of the expression “may” in the first proviso to
Article

          200
, placing reliance on the decision of this Court in
State of Uttar

          Pradesh v. Jogendra Singh
reported in AIR 1963 SC 1618 the

          counsel submitted that in
the said decision
while adjudicating the

          duty of the Governor to refer the cases relating to Government

          servants to the Administrative Tribunal under Rules 4(2) of the

          Civil Service Rules which also used the expression “may” this

          Court had held that the word “may” is capable of meaning “must”

          or “shall” in the light of the context. He further submitted that

          where a discretion is conferred upon a public authority coupled

          with an obligation, the word “may” which denotes discretion

          should be construed to mean a command. Sometimes, the

          legislature uses the word “may” out of deference to the high status

          of the authority on whom the power and the obligation are intended

          to be conferred and imposed.
iv)    The first part of the first proviso is mandatory in nature. It

          authorises the Governor to, as soon as possible, after the

          presentation for Bill for assent, return the Bill together with a

          message requesting the House to reconsider the Bill with the

          desirability of introducing any such amendments as he may

          recommend in his message. He submitted that this interpretation
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 43 of 414
was also followed by this Court in the decision in
State of Punjab
(supra) by stating that Governor must mandatorily follow the

         course of action indicated in the first proviso of communicating to

         the State Legislature “as soon as possible” a message warranting

         reconsideration of the Bill.
ii)   The counsel placed reliance on the following decisions of this Court

         in support of his submission:
e) The observations made by this Court in its decision in Valluri
   Basavaiah Chowdhary are not applicable to the present case
i)     Mr. Singhvi submitted that this Court in
Valluri Basavaiah

          Chowdhary
(supra) had no occasion to adjudicate upon the
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                   Page 47 of 414
interpretation of the constitutional powers of the Governor under
Article 200
of the Constitution. Therefore, the observations of the

          Court in Para 19 cannot be construed to be its ratio decidendi. At

          most, these observations could be considered as obiter dicta.

          Indeed, they may not even constitute obiter but are mere

          observations, totally unconnected to and unnecessary for that case.
ii)    He relied upon the decision of this Court in Secunderabad Club v.
Commissioner of Income-Tax reported in (2023) SCC OnLine

          SC 1004 to submit that in terms of
Article 141
of the Constitution,

          only the ratio decidendi of a judgment, that is, the reason assigned

          in support of the conclusion, is binding. He submitted that this

          Court has held that what is binding, therefore, is the principle

          underlying a decision which must be discerned in the context of the

          question(s) involved
in that case
from which the decision takes its

          colour. In a subsequent case, a decision cannot be relied upon in

          support of a proposition that it did not decide. Therefore, the

          context or the question, while considering which, a judgment has

          been rendered assumes significance.
ii)   It was submitted that when the Petitioner had approached this Court

         initially, the Governor had kept 12 Bills pending. Thereafter, the

         captioned Writ Petitions were heard by this Court on 10.11.2023

         wherein it was observed that the present Writ Petition raised a

         matter of serious concern and issued notice to the Union of India

         represented by the Secretary to the Government in the Ministry of

         Home Affairs. In light of the aforesaid, the Governor hastily on

         13.11.2023 referred two Bills for the consideration of the President

         and withheld assent simpliciter to the remaining 10 Bills. On

         18.11.2023, a special session of Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly

         was held and the 10 Bills were reconsidered and passed in the

         Assembly. These Bills were sent to the Governor for consideration
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 51 of 414
on the same day itself. However, the Governor, with a view to

                render the present petition infructuous, reserved the 10 Bills for the

                consideration of the President.
iii)   In the last, the learned counsel submitted that the action of the

                Governor has been contrary to what was laid down by this Court in
S.R. Bommai
(supra) wherein it was stated that the Governor is a

                very high Constitutional functionary and he is supposed to act fairly

                and honestly, in a manner consistent with his oath. It is for this

                reason that
Article 356
places such implicit faith on his report. If,

                however, in a given case his report is vitiated by legal mala fides,

                it is bound to vitiate the President's action as well.
h. He submitted that on a proper reading of the substantive part and the

     first proviso to
Article 200
, it will be seen that four courses of actions

     are available to the Governor. The observations made in the
State of

     Punjab
(supra) decision may thus warrant a qualification, or

     an additional statement to fine-tune the scope of Article 200.



i.   On the issue as regards whether the first proviso is attracted in all

     instances of withholding of assent, he submitted that the role for the first

     proviso is confined to cases where the bill may not be hit by any
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                          Page 57 of 414
constitutional limitation, is within the competence of the legislature, but

     may admit of changes, amendments, etc. Such amendments or changes

     that the Governor may thus suggest within the scope of the first proviso,

     will not be relatable to matters such as repugnancy. With the perception

     of repugnancy, the focus of the Governor will be outside the first

     proviso.
He argued that even though this Court in
State of Punjab
(supra) has opined that the exercise of power under the first proviso is

     relatable to the withholding of the assent by the Governor, yet this view

     may require a further qualification that in the context of repugnancy,

     unlike any other reason for withholding of assent, the Governor need not

     necessarily proceed to act under the first proviso. The first proviso

     perhaps cannot be read to be pressed into service when both the

     Governor and the State Government understand the repugnancy

     dimension. In the event the State Government desires to clear the

     repugnancy or any other hurdle, it may itself seek the assent of the

     President. In such an event the State Government may also ask the

     Governor to refer the matter to the President for consideration.
j.   He submitted that that in the present case as the President has withheld

     assent to the Bills in question, therefore in terms of the statement of law

     in Hoechst Pharamaceuticals (supra), the action of the President in

     withholding assent is not justiciable. What cannot be directly done by
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                         Page 58 of 414
seeking such justiciability cannot be indirectly achieved by the claim

         that the action of the Governor in forwarding the bills in question to the

         President was beyond his authority.
k. He submitted that the exposition of
Article 200
as done in
State of

         Punjab
(supra) is sub-silentio as the Court while making
the said

         decision
did not take into account the observations made by the

         Constitution Bench in
Valluri Basavaiah
(supra).
l.   In the last, he submitted that the matter may be referred to a larger Bench

         of this Court so as to harmonise the observations made in
B.K. Pavitra
(supra),
Valluri Basavaiah
(supra) and
State of Punjab
(supra).
c. Placing      reliance    on    the    decision     of      this    Court     in
Purushothaman Nambudiri v. State of Kerala
reported in 1961 SCC

           OnLine SC 361 he submitted that the idea of reading in a time limit in
Articles 200
and
201
respectively had been deliberated upon and

           expressly rejected by this Court in
the said decision
.

iii. Whether the decision of this Court in
State of Punjab
(supra)

            could be said to be per incuriam for not having taken into

            consideration the observations made in previous decisions

            rendered by larger benches of this Court?
iv. Whether the observations of this Court in
B.K. Pavitra
(supra) that

          “a discretion is conferred upon the Governor to follow one of the

          courses of action enunciated in the substantive part of Article 200”

          could be said to be per incuriam for having failed to notice the

          position of law as
laid down by
the larger Benches of this Court?



V)    Whether the exercise of discretion by the Governor in discharge of
      his functions under
Article 200
could be said to be subject to
      judicial review? If yes, what are the parameters for such judicial
      review?
iii. If the aforesaid discharge of functions is subject to judicial review,

          whether such discharge of functions could be said to be non-

          justiciable in light of the decisions of this Court in Hoechst

          (supra), Kaiser-I-Hind (supra), and
B.K. Pavitra
(supra)?

VI)   What is the manner in which the President under
Article 201
of the
           Constitution is required to act once a bill has been reserved for his
           consideration by the Governor under
Article 200
of the
           Constitution?
40. D.D. Basu in his Commentary on the Constitution of India (pp. 6311, 8th

     Ed., 2009) has observed that the omission of the expression “in his

     discretion” from
Article 200
signifies that the Governor must exercise his

     power under the Article according to the advice of his ministers. Further, the
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 67 of 414
addition of the expression “shall not withhold assent therefrom” indicates

     that the Governor has no power to veto a reconsidered bill and must assent

     to it whether it is passed in the original form or with amendments.
42. It is important to note that the expression “shall” has been used to qualify

     the three types of declarations that the Governor can make upon presentation

     of the bill to him. Further, the three options provided in the substantive part

     of
Article 200
are connected by the conjunction “or” which signifies that the

     three options are mutually exclusive of each other, and the Governor can

     only choose one of them at a time. In other words, the Governor cannot

     assent to a bill and also reserve it for the consideration of the President at
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 68 of 414
the same time. Similarly, the Governor cannot declare that he withholds

assent and also reserve the bill for the consideration of the President at the

same time. Patanjali Sastri, Chief Justice (as he then was), observed to this

effect in
State of Bihar v. Kameshwar Singh
reported in (1952) 1 SCC 528

as follows:
48. Jessica J. Richardson2 in her paper titled “Modernisation of Royal Assent in

      Canada”, has traced the historical origins of the practice of granting assent

      to bills enacted by the Parliament in the United Kingdom. She has explained

      that the practice of signifying royal assent to bills passed by Parliament

      began during the reign of Henry VI (1422-71), when the practice of

      introducing bills in the form of petitions was replaced by bills in the form of

      complete statutes. This was a time when assent was granted in person. The

      Sovereign would attend the Parliament in the House of Lords and give his

      consent in person. This practice continued until 1541, when the task of

      signifying royal assent was assigned to a Royal Commission in order to

      spare King Henry VIII the indignity of having to give royal assent to the Bill

      of Attainder, which provided for the execution of his wife Catherine

      Howard. It was after this occurrence that the practice of appointing Lords

      Commissioners responsible for giving royal assent developed. In the United

      Kingdom, the last instance of a monarch giving royal assent in person was

W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                                   Page 72 of 414
in 1854 when Queen Victoria personally assented to several bills prior to

     proroguing the Parliament. However, in Canada, King George VI gave royal

     assent in person to bills passed by the Canadian Parliament in 1939 during

     a visit to Canada. The use of a royal assent ceremony continued in the United

     Kingdom until 1967, when the British Parliament passed the Royal Assent

     Act, 1967. The said legislation repealed the Royal Assent by Commission

     Act, 1541 and allowed a simple report of royal assent by the Speakers of the

     two Houses to give a bill the force of law.
General it shall be lawful for His Majesty in Council to
            signify his disallowance of the Act.
59. In 1944, the All India Hindu Mahasabha adopted the Constitution of

    Hindustan Free State Act as an aspirational constitutional document. As
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 82 of 414
regards the procedure of assent by Governor in provinces, the document

    contained the following provision:
However, the Governor continued to have some special responsibilities and

     he also possessed discretionary powers to act in situations such as prevention

     of grave menace to the peace or tranquility of the province, safeguarding the

     legitimate interests of minorities and so on. The Governor could also act in

     his discretion in specified matters. He functioned under the general
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 88 of 414
superintendence and control of the Governor-General, whenever he acted in

     his individual judgement or discretion.
68. It is interesting to note that while the framing of the Constitution was being

     undertaken by the Constituent Assembly, the GoI Act, 1935 as adapted by

     the India (Provisional Constitution) Order, 1947 was made applicable for

     the administration of the country. By way of paragraph 3 of the said order,

     the expressions “in his discretion”, “acting in his discretion” and “exercising

     his individual judgement” were removed/deleted from wherever they

     occurred in the GoI Act, 1935. Paragraph 3 read thus:
76. On the other hand, during the course of the debate, Shri. Shibban Lal Saxena,

        addressed the practical realities of assigning such a discretion to the

        Governor who is a nominee of the President, especially when the party in

        power in the province may not be the same as the party in power at the

        Centre. In such a scenario, it was his opinion that, “it will introduce a very

        wrong principle to give the Governor this power to go against the express

        wish of the Assembly and even of the council”4.
81. Such a clause was initially supposed to be included in the Fourth Schedule

    that separately contained instructions to the Governors of the States.

    However, since it was considered unnecessary to have such a separate

    Schedule, this particular aspect was sought to be brought in as second

    proviso to the draft
Article 175.
A need to incorporate the second proviso

    was felt because the High Courts were placed under the legislative

    competence of the Centre as well as the States. In so far as the organization

    and territorial jurisdiction of the High Court was concerned, the power

    remained with the Centre. However, with regard to the pecuniary

    jurisdiction and the jurisdiction in relation to any of the matters which are

    mentioned under List II, the power rests with different States. Therefore,

    there could arise a scenario wherein the State legislature would enact a bill

    which would derogate from the powers of the High Court. For example,

    passing a bill that reduces the pecuniary jurisdiction of the High Court by

    raising the value of the suit that may be entertained by the High Court. This

    would be one method whereby the State legislature would diminish the

    authority of the High Court. Furthermore, a bill could also affect the subject-

    matter jurisdiction of a High Court. For example, in enacting any measure

    under any of the entries contained in List II, say, debt cancellation, it would

    be open for the provinces or States to say that the decree made by any such
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 97 of 414
Court or Board shall be final and conclusive, and that the High Court should

        not have any jurisdiction in the matter at all. In light of such possibilities, it

        was felt that the second proviso to draft
Article 175
must be added.
86. While examining the various facets of Centre-State relations, the

    Commission found it apposite to discuss the role of the Governor in the

    political context which existed back then. Taking note of the skirmishes

    between the State governments and Governors, the Commission was of the

    view that the Governor’s office ceased to be merely ornamental and

    ceremonial. This changed role demanded a scrutiny of the discretionary

    powers of the Governor.
88. The ARC, therefore, recommended the following:
92. To answer this question, the Commission adverted to the history of the

    making of the Constitution and concluded that the Constitution does not

    provide for the issue of any instructions to the Governor, nor does it vest any

    discretionary powers in express terms in the Governor, except in relation to

    certain specified matters. While referring to certain judicial pronouncements

    of this Court as well as Granville Austin’s seminal work on the Indian

    Constitution, the Commission opined that the discretion of the Governor

    must be limited to those matters in respect of which there are express

    provisions in the Constitution. The relevant portion of the report is

    reproduced below:
94. However, in the same vein, it was also noted that the Governor has to

    function in a dual capacity as (1) the appointee of the central government;
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 104 of 414
and (2) the constitutional head of the State. This is because the Central

       Government retains the power to appoint and remove the Governor,

       therefore, the Governor cannot but look to the Central Government for

       guidance in the discharge of his duties.
97. In June 1983, the Central government headed by the former Prime Minister

    of India, Ms. Indira Gandhi, formally constituted a commission to examine

    and review the working of the arrangements between the Union and States

    in regard to powers, functions and responsibilities in all spheres and to

    recommend such changes or other measures as may be deemed appropriate.

    The said commission was formed under the chairmanship of a former judge

    of this Court, Justice R.S. Sarkaria and hence, came to be known as the

    Sarkaria Commission.
104. According to the Commission, the scheme of the Constitution indicates that

    the Governor’s opinion at best, is persuasive. The Governor cannot, in any

    circumstance, exercise dictatorial powers to override or veto the decisions

    or proposals of his Council of Ministers. The scope of discretionary powers

    should be construed in the context of a parliamentary democracy with a

    responsible government. In such a form of government, the role of a formal

    head of the State cannot be enlarged at the cost of the real executive, which

    enjoys the confidence of the people as it is responsible to the State

    legislature.
116. Since, conditional assent may become a tool for the Centre to dictate its

     policies to the States by attaching conditions to Presidential assent, the

     Commission, in cognizance of the impropriety of such a practice,

     recommended that in cases where the Union Government is of the opinion

     that some amendments to a State bill are essential before it becomes a law,

     such bill should be returned through the Governor to the State legislature for

     reconsideration in terms of the proviso to Article 201.

Governor.
127. Another Commission on Centre-State relations was constituted by the

      Government of India in 2007 under the chairmanship of Justice Madan

      Mohan Punchhi, the former Chief Justice of India. The Commission was

      tasked with the mandate of reviewing the existing arrangements between the

      Union and States as per the Constitution of India in regard to powers,

      functions and responsibilities in all spheres including legislative relations,

      administrative relations, role of Governors, emergency provisions, etc. and

      recommending such changes as may be appropriate keeping in view

      practical difficulties, growing challenges of ensuring good governance and

      the need for strengthening the unity and integrity of the country.
130. The Commission observed that the nature and scope of rights and powers of

     the Governor should be understood in the context of a Cabinet system of

     government. Under such system, the Governor performs a multi-faceted

     role. First, as constitutional head of the State, he has a right to be consulted,

     to warn and encourage. In performance of this role, the Constitution makers

     ideated the office of Governor to perform the role of a “a friend, philosopher

     and guide” to his Council of Ministers. Secondly, the Governor functions as

     a sentinel of the Constitution and acts as the Union’s representative in the

     State. As observed by this Court in
Rameshwar Prasad & Ors. v. Union of

     India
reported in (2006) 2 SCC 1, the Governor discharges “dual

     responsibility” to the Union and State.
131. Further, the Constitution affords the Governor only a persuasive role and not

     dictatorial powers to override or veto the decisions or proposals of his

     Council of Ministers. The Commission observed that the Governor, at best,

     has powers of giving advice or counselling for further reflection of the

     decision taken by the Council of Ministers. The Governor only flags a need

     for caution for the purpose of bridging the understanding between the

     Government and opposition (if there are different governments at the central

     and state level).
135. In continuation to the Sarkaria Commission’s views on the question of

     discretionary powers of the Governor, the Punchhi Commission report also

     asserts that the area for the exercise of discretion is limited and even in this

     limited area, the Governor’s choice of action should neither be nor appear to

     be arbitrary or fanciful. It must be a choice dictated by reason, actuated by

     good faith and tempered with caution.
143. The tenets of parliamentary democracy demand that while the head of state

     must act on the advice of ministers, the ministers, in turn, must uphold their

     responsibility to the people when providing that advice. Indeed, the very

     raison d’être of a democratic government is to uphold the primacy of the

     Parliament by ensuring executive accountability. This has been aptly put
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 128 of 414
forth by Nicholas Barber, Professor of Constitutional Law and Theory at the

      Oxford University, in his work ‘Can Royal Assent Be Refused on the Advice

      of the Prime Minister?’7 wherein he argues:
145. In Parliament of the UK, the procedure for obtaining Royal Assent begins

       with officials in the Public Bill Office of the House of Lords that manages

       and assists the processes relating to the House’s consideration of public

       legislation. First, a list of bills is prepared by the Clerk of the Parliaments.

       Thereafter, once a date for Royal Assent has been set, all the bills approved

       by both Houses are presented before the monarch for assent. In this regard,

       the monarch has no power to withhold assent to a bill, regardless of any

       instructions from the Government or anyone else.8 In Scotland, a period of

       four weeks is allowed before a bill is presented to the Queen for assent,

       during which any legal objections may be raised.
Traditionally, once a bill was passed in identical form by both the Senate

     and the House of Commons, the Governor General, as the Crown’s

     representative, attended the Parliament to provide Royal Assent to such bill.

     In absence of the Governor General, a Justice of the Supreme Court of

     Canada acting as Deputy to the Governor General is presented the bills for

     Royal Assent. The Governor General signs a Declaration of Royal Assent,

     witnessed by the Clerk of the Parliaments.
149. The Supreme Court of Canada in Reference Re Amendment of the

    Constitution of Canada, reported in 1981 SCC OnLine Can SC 77,

    recognized that, by convention, neither the Queen nor the vice-regal

    representative (equivalent of a Governor in India) may, on their own, refuse

    assent to a bill passed by both Houses of the Parliament on the grounds of

    opposition to or disapproval of its policy. The relevant portion of the

    judgment in reference reads thus:
150. In Galati v. Governor-General of Canada, reported in [2015] FC 91, the

    Federal Court of Canada was faced with the question of whether the grant

    of royal assent by the Governor General to the Strengthening Canadian

    Citizenship Act, 2014 could be set aside by the court on the ground that

    enactment of the same was outside the legislative competence of the

    Parliament. It was contended by the applicants that the Governor General

    exceeded the scope of his discretion as well as his authority under the Royal

    Assent Act of Canada by assenting to the said bill. The Federal Court,

    however, dismissed the application and held that the Governor General’s act

    of affixing royal assent to the bill was a legislative act. Therefore, the issue
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 133 of 414
of whether the Governor General exceeded his constitutional authority in

     granting royal assent to the said bill was not justiciable. The relevant portion

     of the judgment is reproduced below for ready reference:
151. The views of the Federal Court in Galati (supra) that the grant of royal

     assent by the Governor-General was a legislative act and hence, non-

     justiciable was in line with the view of the Court in Gallant v. The King,

     [1949] 2 DLR 425 wherein it was noted that the Lieutenant-Governor is a

     part of the legislature and the act of providing royal assent is also a

     legislative action.
h.    Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka
174. In other words, his contention was that simpliciter withholding is to be opted

     for by the Governor in his position as a custodian of the Constitution in the

     State, while the procedure prescribed in the first proviso is to be followed

     by him in his role as a friend, philosopher and guide of the State

     Government, with a view to improve an otherwise constitutionally

     innocuous piece of legislation.
175. The aforesaid contention of the Attorney General was met by the petitioner

     by placing reliance on the recent decision of this Court in
State of Punjab
(supra) wherein it was held that the option of withholding of assent under

     the substantive part of
Article 200
is attached with the first proviso. The

     petitioner contended that in light of the said observation, it is not open for
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 147 of 414
the Governor to undertake any simpliciter withholding of a bill presented to

    him and he must mandatorily resort to the procedure indicated in the first

    proviso if he decides to withhold assent to a bill.
176. The Attorney General, on the other hand, raised doubts as regards the

    correctness of the decision in
State of Punjab
(supra) and argued that
the

    said decision
was rendered without having regard to the earlier decisions

    given by larger Benches of this Court.
In particular, he placed reliance on

    certain observations made by the Constitution Bench in
Valluri Basavaiah

    Chowdhary
(supra) to support his contention.
177.
In response, the petitioner argued in favour of the decision in
State of

    Punjab
(supra) and submitted that the observations made in
Valluri

    Basavaiah Chowdhary
(supra) were made in a case where this Court was

    not dealing with the interpretation of
Article 200
of the Constitution. Thus,

    the observations made therein as regards
Article 200
could be said to be

    obiter dicta at best. Mr. Dwivedi went to the extent of submitting that the

    observations of this Court being relied upon by the Attorney General cannot

    be construed as obiter dicta as they were mere passing remarks irrelevant to

    the lis before the Court
in that case
.
178. It is in this backdrop that we are called upon to ascertain whether the

    observations made in
Valluri Basavaiah Chowdhary
(supra) can be

    reconciled with the decision of this Court in
State of Punjab
(supra). The

    consequence of this inquiry would be that it would determine whether the

    constitutional scheme of
Article 200
envisages a simpliciter withholding of

    assent by the Governor.
In other words, if the decision in
State of Punjab
(supra) is found to be per incuriam, it would mean that the Governor under
Article 200
has the power of exercising an absolute veto upon any bill which

    is presented to him for assent.
179. Before going into the question of whether the observations made in
Valluri

    Basavaiah Chowdhary
(supra) could be said to be the ratio, obiter or

    irrelevant to the lis, we deem it necessary to reproduce the observations

    relied upon by the Attorney General in support of his submission:
180. The crux of the controversy as regards whether the first proviso provides an

     independent course of action to the Governor lies in the use of the expression

     “in which case the Bill falls through unless the procedure indicated in the

     first proviso is followed”. However, what is interesting to note is that this

     expression did not come to be used for the first time in
Valluri Basavaiah

     Chowdhary
(supra).

     1 SCC 528 observed as follows:
24. The substantive part of
Article 200
empowers the
        Governor to withhold assent to the Bill. In such an event, the
        Governor must mandatorily follow the course of action which
        is indicated in the first proviso of communicating to the State
        Legislature “as soon as possible” a message warranting the
        reconsideration of the Bill. The expression “as soon as
        possible” is significant. It conveys a constitutional
        imperative of expedition. Failure to take a call and keeping a
        Bill duly passed for indeterminate periods is a course of
        action inconsistent with that expression. Constitutional
        language is not surplusage. In State of Telangana v.
Governor of Telangana [State of Telangana v. Governor of
        Telangana
, (2024) 1 SCC 405] this Court observed that “The
        expression ‘as soon as possible’ has significant
        constitutional content and must be borne in mind by
        constitutional authorities.” The Constitution evidently
        contains this provision bearing in mind the importance which
        has been attached to the power of legislation which squarely
        lies in the domain of the State Legislature. The Governor
        cannot be at liberty to keep the Bill pending indefinitely
        without any action whatsoever.
185. As the observation made by this Court in the three decisions
referred to

    above
holds that the Bill would fall through unless the procedure prescribed

    in the first proviso is followed, we first need to understand the procedure

    that is prescribed in the first proviso. The proviso stipulates that when any
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 157 of 414
bill, other than a Money Bill, is presented to the Governor for assent, he

     may, as soon as possible, return it to the State legislature, together with a

     message. As regards the contents of the message, the proviso stipulates that

     the Governor may request the House(s) of the State legislature to reconsider

     the bill or certain parts of it, and also explore the desirability of introducing

     certain amendments as may be suggested by the Governor in the message.

     Once the bill is so returned together with the message, the House(s) are

     required to reconsider the bill in accordance with the recommendations

     contained in the message of the Governor. If the bill is then passed again by

     the House(s), with or without amendments, and presented to the Governor,

     then the Governor cannot withhold assent from such a bill.
191. Another important aspect that may be pointed out is that the observations

    made in
Valluri Basavaiah Chowdhary
(supra) and Hoechst (supra),

    respectively state that except in the case of a Money Bill, the Governor may

    withhold assent. A bare reading of
Article 200
indicates that there is no

    restriction in the substantive part that prohibits the Governor from declaring

    that he withholds assent to a Money Bill, and it is only under the first proviso

    that such a restriction can be found. Therefore, it is only when the option of

    the withholding of assent in the substantive part of
Article 200
is read along

    with the first proviso that Money Bills could be said to be excluded from the

    purview of withholding of assent under the substantive part of
Article 200.
Thus, rather than fortifying the argument of the learned Attorney General,

    the observations made in
Valluri Basavaiah Chowdhary
(supra) and

    reiterated in Hoechst (supra) only reinforce the intricate and inseparable

    connection between the exercise of the option of withholding of assent by

    the Governor and coming into operation of the procedure prescribed in the
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 162 of 414
first proviso.
The dictum of the above mentioned two decisions in no way

    renders the decision in
State of Punjab
(supra) per-incuriam, and rather

    bolsters the line of reasoning adopted by this Court therein.

193. This Court in
Nambudiri
(supra) explained as to how the State legislature

    may cause a bill to fall through with which they no longer intend to proceed

    by not reconsidering and repassing it, once it has been returned by the

    Governor with the deceleration of withholding of assent. This Court held

    that the stage of assent could only be arrived at after the stage of
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 163 of 414
reconsideration and repassing by the State legislature has been successfully

    crossed. The relevant observations read as under: -




W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                         Page 168 of 414







209.
In light of the language of
Article 200
, and also keeping in mind its

    interpretation by this Court in
State of Punjab
(supra), there was no room

    for the Governor to declare a simpliciter withholding of assent without

    taking recourse to the first proviso as that virtually amounts to the exercise

    of absolute veto by the Governor, a power which is conspicuously absent

    from our constitutional scheme.

W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 174 of 414

214. Refuting the contention of the petitioner, the learned Attorney General

     argued that in the absence of any prescribed time-limit in the text of the

     provision, it would not be open to the Court to read in a time-limit and the

     only way to do so would be by way of a constitutional amendment. He

     placed reliance on the decision of this Court in
Nambudiri
(supra) to argue

     that this Court had expressly rejected the idea that there is a time limit which

     circumscribes the exercise of functions of the Governor under
Article 200.

223. What can be postulated from this discussion of the relevant Constituent

        Assembly debates is that although our constitutional makers expressed their

        concerns for the possibility of an undue delay in the legislative process on

        account of the human nature to procrastinate, yet they nevertheless

        proceeded to adopt the phrase “as soon as possible” in the original
Article

226. This Court in
Durga Pada Ghosh v. State of West Bengal
reported in (1972)

    2 SCC 656 whilst dealing with a writ in the nature of habeas corpus was

    called upon to examine the meaning and import of the expression “as soon

    as may be” appearing in
Article 22(5)
of the Constitution and its significance

    in communication of the grounds of detention and disposal of the

    representation of the detenu. In the said case, the detenu came to be arrested

    and put in preventive detention in December, 1971. The detenu moved a

    representation which was received in early January, 1972. However, his

    representation came to be considered by the State government therein only

    in February, 1972 and his detention was confirmed and communicated in

    March, 1972. The detenu challenged the order of preventive detention

    passed against him on the ground that there was an inordinate delay of

    almost two months on part of the State government in considering his

    representation even though the same had been received in January itself.

    This Court held that the aforesaid expression must be seen in the context of

    the scheme underlying
Article 22
, more particularly, the importance that it

    occupies in the constitutional set-up as regards the personal freedom of an
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 182 of 414
individual and in a manner whereby the provision does not lose both its

purpose and meaning. The words “as soon as may be” in such context

implies anxious care on the part of the authority concerned to perform its

duty in this respect, as early as practicable, without avoidable delay. The

course of action which is expected from the concerned authority; being

communication of the grounds of arrest and disposal of the representation,

was required to be considered with a sense of urgency and must be done

with due promptitude or expedition and with reasonable dispatch. It was

further held that although there is no definite time-limit which can be laid

down within which such actions must be done, yet at the same time, whether

the appropriate authority had disposed of its obligation as expeditiously as

possible ought to be looked into keeping in mind the peculiar facts and

circumstances of each case. It further held that such constitutional

obligations cannot be ignored or justified on reasons of administrative delay

except where it is shown that ample arrangements were made to cope with

the situation that led to a delay and a certain degree of priority was accorded.

The relevant observations read as under:
227.
In
Keisham
(supra) the question that arose before this Court was whether

    courts can direct the Speaker to decide disqualification petitions pending

    before it within a reasonable period of time, and this Court speaking

    eruditely through R.F. Nariman, J., answering the aforesaid question in an

    affirmative held as under:
(Emphasis supplied)
(ii)   Secondly, it observed that although Paragraph 6 of the Tenth

       Schedule vests the Speaker with an exclusive jurisdiction to decide

       disqualification petitions and ousts the reach of courts in such matters,

       yet it does not mean that there is no scope of judicial review by the

       courts or that the power to pass any direction(s) to the Speaker acting

       under the Tenth Schedule does not exist. It was observed that the true

       purport of such exclusive jurisdiction was only to ensure that no

       obstacle comes in the way of the Speaker in deciding such petitions
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 186 of 414
by way of injunctions from the courts. However, it by no means

        interdicts the exercise of judicial review in aiding a prompt decision

        on such disqualification petitions to ensure that the Speaker decides

        these issues within a reasonable period. The relevant observations

        read as under:
228. The aforesaid view was reiterated in
State of Telangana v. Governor of

    Telangana
reported in (2024) 1 SCC 405 wherein this Court whilst dealing

    with a similar issue pertaining to the pendency of a few bills before the

    Governor of Telangana, held that the expression “as soon as possible” in
Article 200
has significant constitutional content and must be borne in mind

    by the constitutional authorities. The relevant observations read as under:
229.
In
Ram Chand
(supra) certain parcels of land had been demarcated and

    declared for compulsory acquisition vide a notification, sometime between

    the years 1959-1965. However, the awards for compensation came to be

    passed almost fourteen-years later in the year 1980. These awards came to

    be challenged before this Court on the ground that since the statute in

    question provides for payment of compensation in respect of the acquisition

    made at the market value of the land, as it stood, at the time of publication

    of the notification for declaration, the same necessarily meant that

    compensation ought to be paid expeditiously and without delay. This Court

    held that although the legislature by way of an amendment has now

    prescribed a time-limit for making an award, yet it does not mean that prior

    to such amendment there was no time-limit for payment of compensation or

    that an award could be passed by the authorities at their own pace and

    leisure. It held that where for exercise of any power no time-limit has been

    prescribed, such power has to be exercised within a reasonable period of

    time. It further held that sans any fixed time-limit, such powers cannot be
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 189 of 414
exercised or subjected to delay in a manner that violates or circumvents the

object of the statute and the constitutional mandate under
Article 31A
of

timely acquisition and adequate compensation, respectively. The relevant

observations read as under:
230. In A.G. Perarivalan (supra) the facts germane for our discussion are that

    the appellant convict therein had filed a mercy petition under
Article 161
to

    the Governor in December, 2015. The State Cabinet recommended the grant

    of remission to the Governor in 2018. However, the Governor did not take

    any decision on the mercy petition for two years despite receiving the

    recommendation of the State Cabinet. Thereafter, upon a direction of this

    Court, the Governor in 2021, by an order, forwarded the mercy petition of

    the appellant to the President citing that the Union is the appropriate

    authority to decide the same. This reference came to be challenged before

    this Court wherein it was held as under:
Our Constitution, though federal in its
                 structure, is modelled on the British
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                     Page 192 of 414
parliamentary system where the executive is
                 deemed to have the primary responsibility for
                 the formulation of governmental policy and its
                 transmission into law though the condition
                 precedent to the exercise of this responsibility
                 is its retaining the confidence of the legislative
                 branch of the State. The Governor occupies the
                 position of the head of the executive in the State
                 but it is virtually the Council of Ministers in
                 each State that carries on the executive
                 Government. In the Indian Constitution,
                 therefore, we have the same system of
                 parliamentary executive as in England and the
                 Council of Ministers consisting, as it does, of
                 the members of the legislature is, like the
                 British Cabinet, “a hyphen which joins, a
                 buckle which fastens the legislative part of the
                 State to the executive part
However, as held by this Court in numerous
                 decisions, this Court has the power of judicial
                 review of orders of the Governor under
Article
                 161
, which can be impugned on certain grounds.
Non-exercise of the power under
Article 161
is
                 not immune from judicial review, as held by this
                 Court in
Epuru Sudhakar v. State of A.P. Given
petitions under
Article 161
pertain to the liberty
                 of individuals, inexplicable delay not on account
                 of the prisoners is inexcusable as it contributes
                 to adverse physical conditions and mental
                 distress faced by a prisoner, especially when the
                 State Cabinet has taken a decision to release the
                 prisoner by granting him the benefit of
                 remission/commutation of his sentence.”

                                   (Emphasis supplied)
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 196 of 414
(iv)    Lastly, as regards the contention of the respondents that the decision

        of the Governor to forward the mercy petition to the President was

        done in exercise of his discretion owing to the irrational

        recommendation of the Cabinet in line with the ratio of M.P. Special

        Police (supra), this Court held that the aforesaid decision would not

        be applicable, since there is nothing to make out a case of irrational

        or non-consideration of relevant factors by the State government to

        warrant the Governor exercising his discretion and deviating from

        their recommendations as laid down in M.P. Special Police (supra).

        The relevant observations read as under:
238. For the exercise of judicial review, the existence of a certain set of definitive

     standards against which the courts can embark upon their scrutiny, is

     quintessential. Without these standards, the power of judicial review could

     be said to be ineffective in certain contexts which shall be elucidated upon

     in the latter parts of the judgment. The doctrine of stare-decisis is not just

     concerned with ensuring that decisions of higher courts or of larger benches
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 204 of 414
are duly adhered to and questions of law already settled and put to quietus

    by higher judicial authorities are not disturbed. The idea is also to infuse a

    sense of judicial comity within the intertwined hierarchical courts in the

    manner of their functioning. Additionally, one of the core precepts of stare-

    decisis is that not only the decisions but the very decision-making process

    of the courts are predicated upon a discernible standard, often coined as

    ‘judicially manageable standards’. We shall discuss this in more detail in the

    later parts of this judgment.





245. The prescription of a time-limit is with a view to ensure that the Governor

     is not conferred with the power of exercising a pocket veto under the scheme

     of
Article 200
, and hinder the law-making process in the State without the

     existence of any reasonable grounds. While the decision in
Nambudiri
(supra) does not make the prescription of such a time-limit by the Court

     impermissible, the decisions, adverted to above, vest this Court with

     sufficient power to ensure that the procedure prescribed under
Article 200
is

     followed by the Governor in a constitutionally permissible manner and in

     line with the principles of parliamentary democracy keeping in mind the

     nature of the power.        Such an approach also ensures that the State

     governments are not left remediless in cases of malicious, arbitrary or

     capricious exercise of power by the Governor under
Article 200.

247. This Court in
State of Punjab
(supra) held that the Constitution terms any

    inaction on part of the Governor as deplorable and that he cannot indefinitely

    keep the bills passed by the State legislature on a chokehold. The relevant

    observations read as under:
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 209 of 414
248. It is not unusual for this Court to prescribe time-limits for the discharge of

     certain functions, even in cases where no specific time-limit has been

     prescribed. Recently, in Periyammal (Dead) thr. LRs & Ors. v. Rajamani

     & Anr. Etc. reported in 2025 INSC 329, a two-Judge Bench of this Court,

     of which one of us (J.B. Pardiwala, J.) was a part, directed all the High

     Courts to issue directions to all the District Courts to decide pending

     execution petitions within a period of six-months without fail. The directions

     read as follows:

250. Keeping in mind the constitutional significance of
Article 200
and the role

     it plays in the federal polity of the country, the following timelines are being

     prescribed. Failure to comply with these timelines would make the inaction

     of the Governors subject to judicial review by the courts:
In case of presentation of bill after reconsideration in accordance

              with the first proviso, the Governor must grant assent forthwith,

              subject to a maximum period of one-month.
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 212 of 414


255. This argument was also endorsed by Dr. Singhvi, who added that the

    observations made in
B.K. Pavitra
(supra) as regards the discretion of the

    Governor under
Article 200
of the Constitution have to be understood in the

    context of the reservation taking place on the aid and advice of the Council

    of Ministers.


258. An answer to the aforesaid question cannot be arrived at without first

    answering the following sub-questions:
260. The GoI Act, 1935, ushered in the era of provincial autonomy and formally

     required the Governor to act on the advice of the Ministers who were

     accountable to the provincial legislature by abolishing the system of dyarchy

     at the provincial level, while introducing it at the central level. However, the

     Act also conferred upon the Governor certain special responsibilities, such

     as maintaining peace and tranquility within the province and safeguarding

     minority interests. These responsibilities necessitated the exercise of

     discretion by the Governor in specific matters. Further, the autonomy of the

     Governor in such cases remained subject to the general superintendence and
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 216 of 414
control of the Governor-General, ensuring oversight over the exercise of his

     individual judgment.





16



275. However, Shri. T. T. Krishnamachari pointed out that there existed specific

        provisions under the Draft Constitution wherein the Governor was in fact

        empowered to act in his discretion, irrespective of the advice tendered by his
20
8, CONSTITUENT ASSEMB. DEB., (Jun. 1, 1949) 489.
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 228 of 414
Council of Ministers. Therefore, according to him, there were two ways of

        drafting which would capture the aforesaid underlying idea: One, would be

        to make a mention of this exception under draft
Article 143
itself and

        enumerate the specific scenarios where the Governor would be able to

        exercise his discretion in the subsequent relevant articles or; Two, would be

        to leave out any mention of this discretionary power under draft
Article 143
and only state it in the appropriate article that will follow. In the case of draft
Article 143
, according to him, it was only that the former method had been

        followed. Therefore, the general proposition or the default rule would be that

        “the Governor has normally to act on the advice of his Ministers except in

        so far as the exercise of his discretions covered by those Articles in the

        Constitution in which he is specifically empowered to act in his

        discretion.”21

8, CONSTITUENT ASSEMB. DEB., (Jun. 1, 1949) 492.
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 230 of 414
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 231 of 414
280. Shri. Alladi Krishnaswami Ayyar echoed the stance taken by Shri T.T.

    Krishnamachari. He stated that, in the first place, a general principle under
Article 143
is laid down, namely, the principle of ministerial responsibility

    that the Governor in the various spheres of executive activity should

    normally act on the advice of his ministers. Then, the Article goes on to

    carve out an exception as regards the matters under which the Governor is

    required to exercise certain functions under his own discretion. Therefore, it

    was his conclusion that as long as there are articles under the Constitution

    which enable the Governor to act in his discretion, the draft
Article 143
as it

    was framed was perfectly in order. In certain circumstances, this exercise of

    discretion may be to override the Cabinet or to refer to the President. If later

    on, the Constituent Assembly were to arrive at the conclusion that those

    subsequent Articles which enable the Governor to act in his discretion in

    specific cases must be deleted, it would be open to revise draft
Article 143.
But as long as there are Articles occurring later in the Constitution which

    permit the Governor to act in his discretion and not on ministerial

    responsibility, the present draft
Article 143
was drafted rightly.
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 232 of 414
281. The only other question, in his opinion, was to see whether the Constituent

        Assembly had to first make a provision under draft
Article 143
that the

        Governor shall mandatorily act on ministerial responsibility and then go on

        to provide “Notwithstanding anything contained in
Article 143
, [...] he can

        do this” or that “Notwithstanding anything contained in
Article 143
, he can

        act in his discretion” in the subsequent relevant Articles. However, he

        favored the method of drafting that had already been adopted i.e., to provide

        in draft
Article 143
itself that the Governor shall always act on ministerial

        responsibility excepting in particular or specific cases where he is

        empowered to act in his discretion. If, of course, the Constituent Assembly

        came to the conclusion that in no case the Governor shall act in his

        discretion, and that he shall in every case act only on ministerial

        responsibility, then there will be a consequential change to this Article.

287. Dr. B. R. Ambedkar was open and quite willing to concede to the position

    of those members who were of the view that the last portion of clause (1) of
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 237 of 414
draft
Article 143
must be amended to mention the specific Articles under

    which the Governor shall exercise discretion, if at that stage of the

    Constituent Assembly debates the provisions intended for such vesting were

    already determined. The difficulty was that the Constituent Assembly had

    not yet arrived at a stage where they could discuss draft
Articles 175
or 188,

    nor had they exhausted all the possibilities of other provisions being made

    which vested the Governor with discretionary power. If all those

    possibilities were already known, draft
Article 143
could have been

    amended and those specific Articles could have been mentioned or listed

    out. Therefore, Dr. B. R. Ambedkar was firmly of the view that no wrong

    could be done if the words as they stood in the draft Article were retained.

289. What flows from a study of the Constituent Assembly debates concerning

    the appointment of the Governor and the scope of his discretionary powers

    is that the Governor plays a very crucial role in the political structure of the

    country. He is the bridge between the governments at the Central and State

    level, the proverbial buckle which ties the States with the Centre. The

    Punchhi Commission Report also acknowledged this dual role of the

    Governor – one as the custodian of the Constitution in the States and a

    representative of the Union, and the other as the constitutional head of the

    State and a “friend, philosopher and guide” of the State government as well

    as the people. The position of the Governor and how it differs from that of

    the President were discussed by Dr. B. R. Ambedkar as we have elaborated

    in the preceding paragraphs. This difference was also taken note of by

    Krishna Iyer J., in his opinion in
Samsher Singh
(supra) as we will discuss

    subsequently. We are of the firm view that this unique position of the

    Governor must be kept in mind whenever we set out to interpret any

    provision of the Constitution pertaining to any gubernatorial powers or
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 239 of 414
functions. It is not terminologies like “federal”, “quasi-federal” or “unitary”

     which should guide our interpretation of the Constitution. In turn, the words

     and ideas of the wise artisans, who carefully weaved the fabric of the

     Constitution with threads borrowed from across the world after dying them

     in colors uniquely Indian, that we should look towards, when in doubt about

     the fundamental ideas of our Constitution. The framers of the Constitution

     were cognizant of the fact that vesting the Centre with excessive powers

     would not be healthy for the country’s polity. In this regard we may refer to

     the observations made by the Sarkaria Commission – “there is considerable

     truth in the saying that undue centralization leads to blood pressure at the

     Centre and anemia at the periphery. The inevitable result is morbidity, and

     inefficiency. Indeed, centralization does not solve but aggravates the

     problems of the people.” Therefore, the curtailing of the powers of the

     Governor under the Constitution as distinguished from the GoI Act, 1935

     was done keeping in mind that the Centre does not arrogate all powers to

     itself by utilizing the Governor as an intermediary of the Centre at the State.
290. Arijit Pasayat, J., in his dissenting opinion in the decision of this Court in
Rameshwar Prasad
(supra), observed thus on the role of the Governor:
291. A Constitution Bench of this Court in
B.P. Singhal v. Union of India
reported in (2010) 6 SCC 331 observed that the Governor is neither an

    employee of the Union nor the agent of the party in power. The relevant

    observations are extracted below:
292. The question of whether the Governor is bound to act on the aid and advice

    of the Council of Ministers in all circumstances fell for the consideration of

    this Court in
Samsher Singh
(supra). Speaking for the majority, A.N. Ray

    C.J., observed as follows:
55. In making a report under
Article 356
the Governor will
        be justified in exercising his discretion even against the aid
        and advice of his Council of Ministers. The reason is that the
        failure of the constitutional machinery may be because of the
        conduct of the Council of Ministers. This discretionary power
        is given to the Governor to enable him to report to the
        President who, however, must act on the advice of his
        Council of Ministers in all matters. In this context
Article
        163(2)
is explicable that the decision of the Governor in his
        discretion shall be final and the validity shall not be called in
        question. The action taken by the President on such a report
        is a different matter. The President acts on the advice of his
        Council of Ministers. In all other matters where the Governor
        acts in his discretion he will act in harmony with his Council
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 245 of 414
of Ministers. The Constitution does not aim at providing a
            parallel administration within the State by allowing the
            Governor to go against the advice of the Council of Ministers.
56. Similarly,
Article 200
indicates another instance where
            the Governor may act irrespective of any advice from the
            Council of Ministers. In such matters where the Governor is
            to exercise his discretion, he must discharge his duties to the
            best of his judgment. The Governor is required to pursue such
            courses which are not detrimental to the State.”

                                             (Emphasis supplied)
293. A reading of the observations reproduced above indicates that the Court

    identified that the Governor was required to act on his discretion when

    performing his functions, inter alia, under
Articles 356
and
200
of the

    Constitution respectively. However, it is pertinent to note that under
Article

    200
, only the reservation of bills falling under the second proviso was

    observed by the Court to be an exercise which must be undertaken by the

    Governor independent of the advice of the Council of Ministers.
294. Furthermore, this Court laid down a general rule that the Governor, in the

    Cabinet form of government envisaged by the Constitution, acts as a

    constitutional head performing all his functions and exercising all his powers

    on the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers, except in a limited area.

    This limited area of discretion, too, is provided by the Constitution under the

    specific provisions wherein such exercise of discretion is permissible. The
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 246 of 414
Court gave certain illustrative examples where the expression “acts in his

     discretion” was used and observed that such provisions indicated that a

     special responsibility on the Governor has been entrusted upon by the

     Constitution.

295. It is pertinent to observe the observations made by the Court in paragraphs

     54, 55 and 56 of
Samsher Singh
(supra) which are reproduced above. In

     paragraph 54, while giving illustrations of the provisions where the

     Governor is expressly required by the Constitution to act in his discretion,

     the Court made reference to
Articles 356
and
200
respectively. In the context

     of
Article 200
, the Court observed that the limited area where express

     discretion has been conferred upon the Governor falls under the second

     proviso. Thereafter, in paragraph 55, the Court elaborated upon the exercise

     of discretion by the Governor under
Article 356.
In paragraph 56, the Court

     elaborated upon the exercise of discretion under
Article 200
and observed

     that
Article 200
“indicates another instance where the Governor may act

     irrespective of any advice from the Council of Ministers”. It is important to

     read the observations made in paragraph 56 along with paragraph 54 of the

     judgment. A conjoint reading of these two paragraphs, it becomes clear,

     without a cavil of doubt, that the second proviso to
Article 200
is an instance

     under the Constitution where the Governor has been conferred with the

     power to act in his discretion and even against the advice of the Council of
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 247 of 414
Ministers. However, the logical sequitur to this is that under
Article 200
,

     there is no scope for the Governor acting in his discretion other than the

     second proviso.

296. Speaking for himself and P.N. Bhagwati J., the redoubtable Krishna Iyer J.,

     in
Samsher Singh
(supra) observed as follows:
xxx           xxx          xxx
He further observed that the discretionary powers of the Governor existed

    only where they were expressly spelt out in the Constitution, and even the

    exercise of such discretion was remote-controlled by the Union Ministry.
298. Referring to the decision in
Samsher Singh
(supra), Krishna Iyer J., in
Maru Ram v. Union of India
reported in (1981) 1 SCC 107, again,

    reiterated the position of the President and the Governor as figureheads in

    the constitutional scheme. However, he observed that they acted in

    accordance with the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers “save in a

    narrow area of power” and that the “Governor vis-à-vis his Cabinet is no

    higher than the President save in a narrow area which does not include

    Article 161”, thereby implying that there is a small area of discretion

    available with the Governor, which however does not include
Article 161.
The relevant observations are reproduced hereinbelow:
299. A Constitution Bench of this Court while dealing with the issue of

    discretionary powers of the Governor in M.P. Special Police (supra) and

    explaining the import of
Article 163(2)
of the Constitution, observed that

    even if discretion was not expressly granted upon the Governor by a specific

    provision of the Constitution, it was open to him to act in his discretion in

    certain exceptional situations where by reason of threat to democratic
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 252 of 414
principles, he could not act on the advice of the Council of Ministers. The

relevant observations are reproduced hereinbelow:
A(1)(b), 371-A(2)(b), 371-A(2)(f) and paras 9(2) and 18(3) of
        the Sixth Schedule are some of the provisions. However,
        merely because the Constitution of India expressly provides,
        in some cases, for the Governor to act in his discretion, can
        it be inferred that the Governor can so act only where the
        Constitution expressly so provides? If that were so then sub-
        clause (2) of
Article 163
would be redundant. A question
        whether a matter is or is not a matter in which the Governor
        is required to act in his discretion can only arise in cases
        where the Constitution has not expressly provided that the
        Governor can act in his discretion. Such a question cannot
        arise in respect of a matter where the Constitution expressly
        provides that the Governor is to act in his discretion.
Article
        163(2)
, therefore, postulates that there can be matters where
        the Governor can act in his discretion even though the
        Constitution has not expressly so provided.
12. […] Thus, as rightly pointed out by Mr Sorabjee, a seven-
        Judge Bench of this Court has already held that the normal
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 253 of 414
rule is that the Governor acts on the aid and advice of the
        Council of Ministers and not independently or contrary to it.
        But there are exceptions under which the Governor can act
        in his own discretion. Some of the exceptions are as set out
        hereinabove. It is, however, clarified that the exceptions
        mentioned in the judgment are not exhaustive. It is also
        recognised that the concept of the Governor acting in his
        discretion or exercising independent judgment is not alien to
        the Constitution. It is recognised that there may be situations
        where by reason of peril to democracy or democratic
        principles, an action may be compelled which from its nature
        is not amenable to Ministerial advice. Such a situation may
        be where bias is inherent and/or manifest in the advice of the
        Council of Ministers.
xxx          xxx           xxx
19.
Article 163
has been extracted above. Undoubtedly, in a
        matter of grant of sanction to prosecute, the Governor is
        normally required to act on aid and advice of the Council of
        Ministers and not in his discretion. However, an exception
        may arise whilst considering grant of sanction to prosecute a
        Chief Minister or a Minister where as a matter of propriety
        the Governor may have to act in his own discretion. Similar
        would be the situation if the Council of Ministers disables
        itself or disentitles itself.
xxx          xxx           xxx
300. The decision in this case was a step forward from the general rule laid down

     by the larger Bench in
Samsher Singh
(supra). However, what is essential

     to note is that the Court did not dilute the general rule laid down earlier, and

     only allowed for a very limited scope of discretion for the Governor in

     certain exceptional situations in light of
Article 163(2).
The extraordinary

     nature of the exceptional situations envisaged by the Court can be gauged

     from the use of the expressions “peril to democracy or democratic

     principles”, “bias is inherent and/or manifest in the advice of the Council of

     Ministers”, “Council of Ministers disables itself or disentitles itself” and

     “there would be a complete breakdown of the rule of law”. Whenever the

     situation arises for the Governor to exercise discretion in discharge of a

     function which is ordinarily to be exercised upon the aid and advice of the

     Council of Ministers, it is these exceptional circumstances that the Governor

     must take into account before rejecting the aid and advice tendered to him.
Courts too, when judicially reviewing the exercise of discretion by the

     Governor in such cases, must be guided by the situations as described in the

     decision in M.P. Special Police (supra).
Article 200
, being a provision

     where the Governor must act on ministerial advice as a general rule, the
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 255 of 414
aforesaid exposition would squarely apply to this provision as well, thereby

    severely curtailing any possibility of exercise of discretion by the Governor.
301. Another Constitution Bench of this Court in Nabam Rebia (supra) had the

    occasion to discuss at length the nature of the position of the Governor in

    the constitutional scheme, along with the source and scope of his

    discretionary powers. The Court held that the discretionary powers of the

    Governor could be traced back to
Article 163(1)
, that is, he could act in

    exercise of his discretionary powers only where expressly provided for

    under the Constitution, or where the interpretation of a constitutional

    provision could not be construed otherwise, or in cases where this Court has

    declared the exercise of powers to be done by the Governor in his discretion

    notwithstanding ministerial advice. Further, the Court held that the finality

    expressed under
Article 163(2)
was only in respect of those situations where

    the exercise of discretion by the Governor was permissible under the

    framework of
Article 163(1)
and any exercise of discretion beyond the

    jurisdiction provided by the Constitution would be subject to judicial review.

    The relevant observations are reproduced hereinbelow:
xxx          xxx           xxx
154. We are, therefore, of the considered view that insofar as
        the exercise of discretionary powers vested with the
        Governor is concerned, the same is limited to situations,
        wherein a constitutional provision expressly so provides that
        the Governor should act in his own discretion. Additionally,
        a Governor can exercise his functions in his own discretion,
        in situations where an interpretation of the constitutional
        provision concerned, could not be construed otherwise. We,
        therefore, hereby reject the contention advanced on behalf of
        the respondents, that the Governor has the freedom to
        determine when and in which situation, he should take a
        decision in his own discretion, without the aid and advice of
        the Chief Minister and his Council of Ministers. We
        accordingly, also turn down the contention, that whenever
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 259 of 414
the Governor in the discharge of his functions, takes a
        decision in his own discretion, the same would be final and
        binding, and beyond the purview of judicial review. We are
        of the view that finality expressed in
Article 163(2)
would
        apply to functions exercised by the Governor in his own
        discretion, as are permissible within the framework of
Article
        163(1)
, and additionally, in situations where the clear intent
        underlying a constitutional provision, so requires i.e. where
        the exercise of such power on the aid and advice, would run
        contrary to the constitutional scheme, or would be
        contradictory in terms.
304. This Court in
B.K. Pavitra
(supra) took the view that the Constitution has

    entrusted the Governor with the discretion of reserving a bill, presented to

    him for assent, for the consideration of the President. It also held that the
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 267 of 414
exercise of the power of reservation of bills for the consideration of the

    President could be done by the Governor contrary to the aid and advice

    tendered by the Council of Ministers. The Court observed that such an

    important responsibility having been conferred upon a constitutional

    functionary, its discharge was expected to be undertaken upon careful

    reflection and with statesmanship, and in a manner that does not thwart

    democratic federalism. On the nature of bills which may be reserved for the

    consideration of the President, the Court held that it was impossible to lay

    down with certainty all the situations wherein such a reference may be

    warranted.

305. We find ourselves in disagreement with the view taken in
B.K. Pavitra
(supra) that the Constitution confers a discretion upon the Governor insofar

    as the reservation of bills for the consideration of the President is concerned.

    We say so because the removal of the expression “in his discretion” from

    Section 75 of the GoI Act, 1935 when it was being adapted as
Article 200
of the Constitution, clearly indicates that any discretion which was available

    to the Governor under the GoI Act, 1935 in respect of reservation of bills

    became unavailable with the commencement of the Constitution. The views

    expressed by the members of the Constituent Assembly, which are recorded

    in the debates that took place on
Article 175
of the Draft Constitution, also
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 268 of 414
indicate the same29. We are also of the view that the same is also in alignment

     with the fundamental tenets of responsible government in a parliamentary

     democracy. The only exception to the general principle of the Governor

     adhering to the aid and advice tendered by the Council of Ministers can be

     traced to
Article 163(1)
and the second proviso to
Article 200.
306. Pertinently, the Court in
B.K. Pavitra
(supra) failed to take into

     consideration the larger Bench decisions in
Samsher Singh
(supra) and

     M.P. Special Police (supra).
As we have discussed above, paragraphs 54 to

     56 of the decision in
Samsher Singh
(supra) make it clear beyond any doubt

     that there is no express requirement under the Constitution for the exercise

     of discretion by the Governor in discharge of his functions under
Article

     200
, except to the limited extent of the second proviso where the expression

     “in his opinion” is employed for the Governor. This is also apparent from

     the conscious decision of the Constituent Assembly in removing the

     expression “in his discretion” while enacting
Article 200.
Thus, the only

     express stipulation where the Governor may exercise discretion for

     reservation of bills is in the second proviso to
Article 200.
Even when looked

     at from the perspective of necessary implication, the discretion of the

     Governor in reserving the bills for the consideration of the President can be
29
9, CONSTITUENT ASSEMB. DEB. (Aug 1, 1949) 59-62; 10, CONSTITUENT ASSEMB. DEB. (Oct. 17,
1949) 392-394.

311.
B.K. Pavitra
(supra) made a reference to paragraph 375 of the decision in

    Nabam Rebia (supra) to support the idea that the Governor is entrusted with

    discretion in the exercise of his powers under
Article 200.
However, it is

    pertinent to note that in the said paragraph, the Court observed that “The

    Governor is expected to function in accordance with the provisions of the

    Constitution (and the history behind the enactment of its provisions)”. The

    history behind the enactment of
Article 200
is loud and clear and speaks for
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 273 of 414
itself as regards the intention of the framers of the Constitution, as we have

    discussed in detail.

W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 274 of 414
313. Reference must also be made at this point to the observation made by this

    Court in
Valluri Basavaiah Chowdhari
(supra) wherein it was observed

    thus:
314. As discussed earlier, D.D. Basu has also taken a similar view in his

        commentary on the Constitution of India30. The position prevailing in a

        number of international jurisdictions as discussed in the preceding parts of

        this judgment, also lends credence to this view.

315. The deletion of the expression “in his discretion” both from the substantive

        part of
Article 200
as well as from the first proviso to it signifies that the

        intention of the framers of the Constitution was to ensure that the ordinary

        exercise of the Governor’s function under
Article 200
was to be in

        accordance with the aid and advice tendered to him by the Council of

        Ministers. The view expressed by Shri. Brajeshwar Prasad that the Governor

        should be conferred with some veto to negate an unsound legislation was

        expressly rejected by the Constituent Assembly. Further, it was explained

        by Mr. T.T. Krishnamachari that the first proviso was in the form of a saving

        clause where the Council of Ministers could ask the Governor to hold up a

        bill in which certain errors were discovered subsequent to its passage in the

        House(s), or to suitably respond to the popular sentiment expressed after

        such passage. Pertinently, during the course of the debates, it was observed

by Dr. B. R. Ambedkar that in a responsible form of government, there can

     be no room for the Governor to act in his discretion.

319. Exception (a) as mentioned above is one which is expressly provided by the

    Constitution to fall within the ambit of discretionary powers of the

    Governor. Exception (b) flows from a reading of those provisions which

    require the mandatory assent of the President to a bill passed by the State

    legislature and thus are to be construed in light of the observations made in

    Nabam Rebia (supra) as instances “where such intent emerges from a
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 279 of 414
legitimate interpretation of the provision concerned, and the same cannot

     be construed otherwise.” Exception (c) has to be construed and understood

     in the context of the observations made by this Court in M.P. Special Police

     (supra) as covering such “situations where by reason of peril to democracy

     or democratic principles, an action may be compelled which from its nature

     is not amenable to Ministerial advice.”



v.    Whether the exercise of discretion by the Governor in discharge of his
      functions under
Article 200
of the Constitution could be said to be
      subject to judicial review? If yes, what are the parameters for such
      judicial review?

323. Refuting the contention of the petitioner, the Attorney General for India

     placed reliance on the decisions of this Court in
Hoechst
(supra), Kaiser-I-

     Hind (supra), and
B.K. Pavitra
(supra) to argue that the grant of assent

     under
Articles 200
and
201
respectively has been previously held to be non-

     justiciable by this Court.
(iii) Thirdly, if the aforesaid discharge of functions is subject to judicial

           review, whether such discharge of functions could be said to be non-

           justiciable in light of the decisions of this Court in
Hoechst
(supra),

           Kaiser-I-Hind (supra), and
B.K. Pavitra
(supra)?
325.
Samsher Singh
(supra) in paragraph 54 observed that “The discretion

    conferred upon the Governor means that as the constitutional or formal

    head of the State the power is vested in him”. We have also discussed in

    detail, in the preceding sections, that the source of all discretion for the

    Governor is to be found within
Article 163(1)
of the Constitution alone.

    Thus, what falls for us to decide is whether the exercise of this constitutional

    power by the Governor could be said to be amenable to judicial review

    where such exercise is assailed on the ground that it transgresses the

    boundaries set by the Constitution. This Court has had the occasion of

    discussing the concept of judicial review in a catena of cases. We are of the

    view that for a better exposition and enlightenment on this issue, it would be

    prudent and beneficial to make a reference to all these decisions.
326.
In
Maru Ram
(supra) this Court speaking eruditely through the inimitable

    Krishna Iyer, J., observed that all public power including constitutional

    powers of pardon, commutation and release under
Articles 72
and
161
of the

    Constitution respectively, cannot run riot or be exercisable irrationally or

    arbitrarily. Any action under these provisions must be informed by the finer

    canons of constitutionalism. In his words, “the rule of law, under our

    constitutional order, transforms all public power into responsible,

    responsive, regulated exercise informed by high purposes and geared to
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 284 of 414
people’s welfare”. It held that all the powers entrusted by the Constitution

must, in its exercise, eschew any form of arbitrariness and stem from an

intelligible and well-reasoned criterion that is predicated on an earnest

purpose. It further categorically held that – “while constitutional power is

beyond challenge, its actual exercise may still be vulnerable” – to judicial

review. In the last, Krishna Iyer, J., further cautioned that such power ought

not to be vulgarized or abused by personal vanity and the notions of those

exercising such powers. The relevant observations read as under:
327. This Court, speaking through nine-Judges in
Indra Sawhney v. Union of

    India
reported in (1992) Supp (3) SCC 217 held that the yardstick of

    subjecting an act or a decision to judicial review is not whether it is a

    legislative act or an executive decision on a policy matter but whether it

    violates any constitutional guarantee or the rights under Part III of the

    Constitution. The
Court further held
that the doctrine of political thicket does

    not apply in the Indian constitutional framework. It is not that the courts

    avoid entering into a political question because of the doctrine of separation

    of power, but because of desirability of avoiding entering into a political

    question. The relevant observations are reproduced hereinbelow:
328. Further, this Court in
B.P. Singhal
(supra) upon examining a catena of

    decisions on the scope and evolution of the power of judicial review of the

    courts observed that, although under the English Law, the prerogative

    powers of the monarch such as the power to make treaties, grant mercy or

    to dissolve the parliament etc. are traditionally not subject to judicial review

    due to the very nature of such powers falling outside the expertise and

    competence of the courts, yet such preclusion of the power of judicial review

    is by no means a blanket rule. It observed that even prerogative powers,

    insofar as the questions of legality, rationality or procedural propriety are

    concerned, would always be amenable to judicial review, because the

    safeguarding of such considerations in the exercise of any prerogative

    powers is the domain, responsibility and duty of the courts as the sentinel on

    the qui vive.
Placing reliance on the decision of this Court in
State of

    Rajasthan v. Union of India
reported in (1977) 3 SCC 592 it held that the
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 288 of 414
courts, as the protector and ultimate interpreter of the Constitution, not only

have the power but an obligation to determine the power conferred on each

branch of the government, the extent and limits of such powers and whether

the exercise of such power exceeds those limits or not, irrespective of

whether such powers are the exclusive prerogative of any one branch of the

government or such questions are inherently political in complexion. The

relevant observations read as under:
329.
Furthermore, B.P. Singhal
(supra) categorically held that unlike England,

    all powers that have been conferred upon the President and the Governor by

    the Constitution are not a matter of prerogative but a constitutional
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 291 of 414
responsibility and its exercise, a matter of performance of an official duty of

the highest sanctity, and thus, unquestionably amenable to judicial review.

It observed that the sufficiency of the attending facts and circumstances

necessitating the exercise of such powers is to be decided by the President

or the Governor. However, the question of whether such exercise is

predicated upon all relevant cogent materials and falls within the limitations

of the constitutional scheme and is not a result of an arbitrary or malafide

exercise, would be subject to the judicial review of the courts.
Placing

reliance on
Maru Ram
(supra) it held that the exercise of such powers by

the President only carries with it a notional presumption of a careful and

proper exercise based on objective considerations, but, by no stretch of

imagination can it be construed to confer an immunity from judicial review.

It further explained, in the context of
Article 72
of the Constitution, the

standard of judicial review that the courts are expected to apply when

scrutinizing the exercise of such power by the President. It held that where

reasons have been given for the exercise of such power, there the courts may

interfere only if the reasons are based on irrelevant or extraneous

considerations. However, where no reasons have been given, there the courts

may interfere only if the exercise is vitiated by a flawed understanding of

the ambit of such power by misjudgment or is otherwise arbitrary,

discriminatory or malafide. The relevant observations read as under: -
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 292 of 414
330.
In
Keisham
(supra), this Court had held that a Speaker acting under the

    Tenth Schedule of the Constitution would be duty bound to decide the
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 293 of 414
disqualification petitions made before him within a reasonable time and that

    any failure in exercising this jurisdiction conferred upon him or reluctancy

    in acting in a time-bound manner would be a fit ground for the courts to

    engage in an exercise of judicial review of his actions, irrespective of the

    fact that it is the Speaker who has the prerogative to adjudicate such

    petitions. It held that even where the jurisdiction of the courts to embark

    upon an examination on the merits of such prerogative powers has been

    ousted, the same does not curtail or inhibit the power of judicial review over

    the manner of exercise or non-exercise of such prerogative powers.
331. Similarly, in A.G. Perarivalan (supra), this Court reiterated that any

    inexplicable or inexcusable non-exercise of a prerogative or sovereign

    power would be amenable to judicial review and that the manner of exercise

    of such powers by the Governor could not be said to be impervious to

    judicial scrutiny.
334. The High Court of Madras in
S. Ramakrishnan v. State of Tamil Nadu
reported in 2020 SCC OnLine Mad 5207 was in seisin of a similar issue

    involving a bill passed by the State Legislative Assembly which remained

    pending for two months before the Governor for grant of assent. When the

    High Court posed a question as regards the inaction on the part of the

    Governor, the Advocate General referred to
Article 361
of the Constitution.

    The Court interpreted
Article 361
in light of
Article 200
and observed that

    the protection granted to the Governor under the Constitution was to perform

    his constitutional duties expeditiously. It also underscored the obligation of

    the courts to perform their constitutional duties and subjecting

    unconstitutional actions to judicial scrutiny in public interest. The relevant

    observations are as follows:
335. Thus, what is discernible from above is that the discharge of functions by

     the President or the Governor as constitutional and formal heads is

     undoubtedly subject to judicial review by virtue of it being an exercise of

     their constitutional powers. However, could it at the same time be said that

     nevertheless it would be improper for the courts to examine such actions of

     the President or the Governor as the actions are essentially political in nature

     and hence non-justiciable for the reason that no judicial standard can be

     evolved for the scrutiny of such actions. In this regard, we may make

     reference to certain decisions rendered by this Court as well as few landmark

     decisions of other international jurisdictions.
336.
In
Minerva Mills v. Union of India
reported in (1980) 3 SCC 625, this Court

     held that the jurisdiction of courts is not ousted merely because a question

     has a political colour. Every constitutional question, irrespective of the

     political complexion or make thereof, falls within the jurisdiction of the

     courts. The Court held that whether the legislature or the executive has acted

     within the limits of its authority or not, is for the courts to decide. The

     relevant observations are as follows:
337. The nine-Judge Bench decision of this Court in
S.R. Bommai
(supra)

    observed that the concept of justiciability is not synonymous with judicial

    review. It noted that even while exercising the power of judicial review,

    courts can decline to exercise such power as being non-justiciable. It

    categorically observed that though judicial review may be avoided on

    questions of political nature, yet legal questions camouflaged with a political

    cloak will be justiciable. The relevant observations have been reproduced

    hereinbelow:
The courts must have judicially manageable standards to
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 299 of 414
decide a particular controversy. Justiciability on a subjective
            satisfaction conferred in the widest terms to the political
            coordinate executive branch created by the constitutional
            scheme itself is one of the considerations to be kept in view in
            exercising judicial review [...]”
                                              (Emphasis supplied)
338. This Court in
A.K. Kaul v. Union of India
reported in (1995) 4 SCC 73 also

    elucidated the distinction between judicial review and justiciability. It

    observed that, in a written Constitution, the bounds within which the various

    organs of the State are delineated, the same implicitly casts a duty upon the

    courts to test the validity of every action of such constitutional organ,

    through judicial review, to ensure that such exercise of power is within the

    confines of the Constitution. It thus, held that the power of judicial review

    of the courts would be available in respect of exercise of all powers by any

    authority under the Constitution unless expressly excluded. It further held

    that, although judicial review is the norm, yet the unavailability of judicially

    manageable standards in certain aspects of the power, whose exercise is in

    question, may render the judicial review of such exercise of power non-

    justiciable. It explained that justiciability refers to the question whether a

    particular field could be said to fall within the purview of the power of

    judicial review. The relevant observations are as follows:
339. This Court in
Epuru Sudhakar v. Govt. of A.P.
reported in (2006) 8 SCC

    161, speaking in the context of
Articles 72
and
161
of the Constitution

    respectively, observed that the determining factor in deciding whether a

    sovereign or prerogative power would be subject to judicial review is the

    subject-matter of such power and not its source. It held that the exercise of

    every prerogative power is subject to the rule of law and the rule of law
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 301 of 414
cannot be made subservient to political expediency. The Court defined that

‘manageable standards’ refer to certain discernible standards expected in a

functioning democracy. It also held that exercise of any prerogative power

cannot be placed in a straitjacket formula and manageable standards would

vary depending on the nature of the power. The relevant observations are as

follows:
However, when the impugned decision does not indicate any
            data or manageable standards, the decision amounts to
            derogation of an important constitutional principle of Rule of
            Law.”
                                             (Emphasis supplied)
340. In Regina (Miller) v. Prime Minister (Lord Advocate and others

    intervening) reported in [2019] 3 WLR 589, the Supreme Court of the

    United Kingdom was dealing with the justiciability of the power of

    prorogation. It was held that, although the courts cannot decide political

    questions, yet, the fact that a dispute arises from a matter of political

    controversy would not restrain the courts completely from looking into it, in

    exercise of judicial review. It further noted that almost all decisions by the

    executive have a political hue to them, yet, the courts in the past have
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 303 of 414
exercised a supervisory jurisdiction. The Court held that a threat to

    parliamentary sovereignty constitutes as a significant ground for

    justiciability of prerogative powers.
341. In the seminal decision of Baker v. Carr, reported in 1962 SCC OnLine US

    SC 40, the Supreme Court of the United States of America examined

    whether questions of legislative apportionment were essentially political

    questions and hence, not justiciable. The Court in this case laid down six

    heavily overlapping indicia of a non-justiciable matter. These were as

    follows: (i) a textually demonstrable constitutional commitment of the issue

    to another political branch; or (ii) a lack of judicially discoverable and

    manageable standards for resolving it, or (iii) a need to make an initial policy

    determination clearly for non-judicial discretion, or (iv) the impossibility of

    a decision by the court without expressing lack of respect due to co-ordinate

    branches of Government; or (v) an unusual need for unquestioning

    adherence to a political decision already made; or (vi) the potentiality for

    embarrassment from multifarious pronouncements by various departments

    on one question. It was emphatically held that, save the aforesaid

    considerations, no other issue is liable for dismissal on ground of a lack of

    justiciability.
342. Before proceeding further, we deem it appropriate to refer to all the aforesaid

     decisions of this Court where the justiciability of assent has been discussed.

     The first in line is the Constitution Bench decision in
Kameshwar Singh
(supra) where M.C. Mahajan, J., (as his lordship then was), in the context of
Article 31A
of the Constitution, observed that the assent of the President,

     once given to a bill reserved for his consideration, is non-justiciable. The

     relevant observations are as follows:
344. The next decision where the justiciability of assent was discussed is the

    decision of the three-Judge Bench in
Hoechst
(supra) wherein, inter alia,

    one of the grounds of challenge to the legislation under consideration was

    that since the subject matter of the bill fell under List II of the Seventh

    Schedule, there was no occasion for the Governor to have reserved the bill

    for the consideration of the President. It is on this ground that the subsequent

    grant of assent by the President was called into question. Negativing the

    contention, the Court observed thus:
345. It is important to note that the aforesaid observations were made by this

    Court in response to the argument that the grant of assent by the President,

    in a case where it was not necessary for the Governor to reserve the bill for

    the consideration of the President, would vitiate the assent given by the

    President. On the contrary, the case at hand involves a totally different

    factual situation wherein the State Government is aggrieved by the

    reservation of bills by the Governor in exercise of his discretion and not in

    accordance with the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers. The further

    grievance of the petitioner is that such reservation of bills by the Governor

    is not guided by constitutional principles but is impelled by lack of bonafides

    and political reasons. The applicability of the
ratio
laid down in
the aforesaid

    decisions of
Kameshwar Singh
(supra) and
Hoechst
(supra) and also the

    other decisions of this Court as regards the questions of justiciability and

    judicial review, would have to be decided keeping in mind the peculiar facts

    of the case at hand which we have been called upon to deal with.
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 307 of 414
346. The decision in
Hoechst
(supra) was referred to in the decision of this Court

     in
Bharat Sevashram Sangh v. State of Gujarat
reported in (1986) 4 SCC

     51 wherein one of the challenges to the validity of the legislation was that

     the bill had received conditional assent from the President, and such partial

     or conditional assent not being permissible under the Constitution, was thus

     erroneous in law.
While the Court referred to the observations made in
Hoechst
(supra), it also looked into the materials on record and arrived at a

     conclusion that there was no infirmity in the grant of assent by the President.

     Therefore, it cannot be said that the decision of the Court was based on the

     non-justiciability of assent alone as the Court arrived at the finding after the

     actual satisfaction on the validity of assent upon a perusal of the relevant

     materials. The relevant observations are reproduced below:
347.
Hoechst
(supra) was also referred to and relied upon by this Court in
B.K.

    Pavitra
(supra) wherein it was observed that owing to the sovereign nature

    of the power of the Governor to reserve a bill for the consideration of the

    President under
Article 200
, it would not be possible for this Court to reflect

    upon the situations in which such a power of reference may be exercised by

    the Governor.
It was further observed by the Court that the decision in
Hoechst
(supra) has excluded the exercise of this power from the scope of

    judicial scrutiny. The relevant observations read as under: -
justiciable.
Hoechst [Hoechst Pharmaceuticals Ltd. v. State
            of Bihar
, (1983) 4 SCC 45 : 1983 SCC (Tax) 248] also lays
            down that even if, as it turns out, it was not necessary for the
            Governor to reserve a Bill for the consideration of the
            President, yet if it was reserved for and received the assent of
            the President, the law as enacted cannot be regarded as
            unconstitutional for want of “proper” assent.
351. As regards justiciability, it was held by the Court that the examination of the

     records to ascertain the extent to which assent was sought for, would not

     amount to deciding whether assent was rightly or wrongly given. Thus, it

     could not be said that the Court was determining the validity of the assent

     granted by the President. The relevant observations made by M.B., Shah J.,,

     speaking for the majority, are reproduced below:
352. Doraiswamy Raju, J., in a concurring opinion, laid strong emphasis on the

    requirement that a reference to the President for the purpose of
Article

    254(2)
must be precise and specific as regards the extent of protection sought

    for the State legislation. He observed that keeping in mind the serious
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 315 of 414
implications of the grant of assent of the President to a repugnant State law,

the making of such reference to the President cannot be exercised in a routine

manner. He further observed that the non-justiciability of the assent of the

President would not preclude the constitutional courts from examining the

sufficiency and justifiability of the predominance sought for the State

legislation over the Central legislation. The relevant observations are

reproduced below:
74. The mere forwarding of a copy of the Bill may obviate, if
        at all, only the need to refer to each one of the provisions
        therein in detail in the requisition sent or the letter
        forwarding it, but not obliterate the necessity to point out
        specifically the particular Central law or provisions with
        reference to which, the predominance is claimed or
        purported to be claimed. The deliberate use of the word
        “consideration” in clause (2) of
Article 254
, in my view, not
        only connotes that there should be an active application of
        mind, but also postulates a deliberate and careful thought
        process before taking a decision to accord or not to accord
        the assent sought for. If the object of referring the State law
        for consideration is to have the repugnancy resolved by
        securing predominance to the State law, the President has to
        necessarily consider the nature and extent of repugnancy, the
        feasibility, practicalities and desirabilities involved therein,
        though may not be obliged to write a judgment in the same
        manner, the courts of law do, before arriving at a conclusion
        to grant or refuse to grant or even grant partially, if the
        repugnancy is with reference to more than one law in force
        made by Parliament. Protection cannot be claimed for the
        State law, when questioned before courts, taking cover under
        the assent, merely asserting that it was in general form,
        irrespective of the actual fact whether the State claimed for
        such protection against a specific law or the attention of the
        President was invited to at least an apprehended repugnancy
        vis-à-vis the particular Central law. In the teeth of
        innumerable Central laws enacted and in force on concurrent
        subjects enumerated in List III of the Seventh Schedule to the
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 318 of 414
Constitution, and the hoard of provisions contained therein,
        artificial assumptions based on some supposed knowledge of
        all those provisions and the presumed regularity of official
        acts, cannot be blown out of proportion, to do away with an
        essential exercise, to make the “assent” meaningful, as if they
        are empty formalities, except at the risk of rendering
Article
        254
itself a dead letter or merely otiose. The significant and
        serious alteration in or modification of the rights of parties,
        both individuals or institutions resulting from the “assent”
        cannot be overlooked or lightly brushed aside as of no
        significance, whatsoever. In a federal structure, peculiar to
        the one adopted by our Constitution it would become
        necessary for the President to be apprised of the reason as to
        why and for what special reason or object and purpose,
        predominance for the State law over the Central law is
        sought, deviating from the law in force made by Parliament
        for the entire country, including that part of the State. When
        this Court observed in
Gram Panchayat of Village Jamalpur
        v. Malwinder Singh
[(1985) 3 SCC 661] that when the assent
        of the President is sought for a specific purpose the efficacy
        of the assent would be limited to that purpose and cannot be
        extended beyond it, and that if the assent is sought and given
        in general terms so as to be effective for all purposes different
        considerations may legitimately arise, it cannot legitimately
        be contended that this Court had also declared that
        reservation of the State law can also be by mere reference to
Article 254(2)
alone with no further disclosures to be made
        or that with mere forwarding of the Bill, no other information
        or detail was either a permissible or legalized and approved
        course to be adopted or that such course was held to be
        sufficient, by this Court, to serve the purpose of the said
        article. The expression “general terms” needs to be
        understood, in my view, a reference to a particular law as a
        whole in contrast to any one particular or individual in the
        said law and not that, it can be even without any reference
        whatsoever. The further observation therein, (SCC p. 669,

“not only was the President not apprised in the
             instant case that his assent was sought because of
             the repugnancy between the State Act and the pre-
75. This Court has, no doubt, held that the assent accorded
        by the President is not justiciable, and courts cannot spell out
        any infirmity in the decision arrived at, to give the assent.
        Similarly, when the President was found to have accorded
        assent and the same was duly published, it cannot be
        contended that the assent was not really that of the President,
        as claimed. It is also not given to anyone to challenge the
        decision of the President according assent, on merits and as
        to its legality, propriety or desirability. But that is not the
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 320 of 414
same thing as approving an attempt to draw a blanket or veil
        so as to preclude an examination by this Court or the High
        Court as to the justifiability and sufficiency or otherwise of
        the protection or predominance claimed for the State law
        over the law made by Parliament or the existing law, based
        upon the assent accorded, resulting at times in substantial
        alteration, change or modification in the rights and
        obligations of citizen, including the fundamental rights.
        When the Constitution extends a form of protection to a
        repugnant State law, permitting predominance and also to
        hold the field in the place of the law made by the Centre,
        conditioned upon the reservation of the State law for
        consideration of the President and obtaining his assent, it is
        to be necessarily viewed as an essential prerequisite to be
        effectively and meticulously fulfilled before ever availing of
        the protection and the same cannot be viewed merely as a
        ceremonial ritual. If such a vitally essential procedure and
        safeguard is to be merely viewed as a routine formality which
        can be observed in whatever manner desired by those
        concerned and that it would be merely enough, if the assent
        has been secured howsoever obtained, it would amount to
        belittling its very importance in the context of distribution of
        legislative powers and the absolute necessity to preserve the
        supremacy of Parliament to enact a law on a concurrent topic
        in List III, for the entire country. It would also amount to
        acceptance of even a farce of compliance to be actual or real
        compliance. Such a course could not be adopted by courts
        except by doing violence to the language, as well as the
        scheme, and the very object underlying
Article 254(2).
355. The reason why this Court in Kaiser-I-Hind (supra) insisted that the

    requirement of delineating the reasons necessitating the reservation of a bill

    by the Governor rests upon the State government is because it is the State

    through its Council of Ministers who are objectively better equipped in

    doing so, by virtue of the fact that the genesis of such bills is normally

    spearheaded by the Council of Ministers. Their close involvement in the

    deliberations that culminated into the bill, their crucial role as part of the

    members of the house of legislature and them being reposed with the

    responsibility of overall governance and well-being of the State, provides

    them the necessary expertise to assign robust reasons in making a reference.

    The State Council of Ministers being uniquely positioned to understand the

    legislative requirements of the State, the policy imperatives prevailing

    therein, and the socio-economic conditions demanding redressal, can better

    voice the reasons that ought to accompany such a reference which the

    Governor otherwise may not be capable of reasonably and comprehensively

    ascertaining if not for the aid and advice of the council of ministers.
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 325 of 414
356. It is in this background that we are of the view that the Governor would be

     duty bound to give careful deference to the aid and advice of the State

     Council of Ministers and only in the limited of exceptional circumstances

     may he deviate from such advice tendered to him, subject to the reference

     being in tune with the aforesaid principles enunciated in the preceding

     paragraphs.
359. The majority opinion of the Court in Kaiser-I-Hind (supra) held that the

     legislative procedure to be followed before the enactment of a legislation

     would always be amenable to judicial review and thus it would be open to

     the Courts to examine the reference which is made by the State government

     to the President seeking his assent. Applying the same logic, it could be said
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 327 of 414
that the reservation of bills by the Governor for the consideration of the

     President is also part of legislative procedure and thus the Courts would not

     be precluded from examining such reference to determine its legality and its

     constitutional veracity.
360. In the Canadian decision in Galati (supra) the grant of royal assent to a bill

     was held as non-justiciable on the ground of separation of powers, the grant

     of assent having been characterised as a legislative act. However, it must be

     kept in mind that the characterisation of the grant of assent as a legislative

     act was in the context of the well settled constitutional convention of a

     responsible government that assent must be granted in accordance with the

     advice of the Prime Minister. Further, as we have discussed in the preceding

     paragraphs, it is not the source of power, but the contents thereof which

     determine the scope of judicial review under the Constitution.
361. On the contrary, Anne Twomey writes that in cases where a Constitution is

     prescriptive, and a constitutional breach is involved, a court is more likely

     to hold the breach to be a justiciable issue, even if it relates to the grant of

     assent to a bill. She refers to the opinion of Millhouse, J. in Re

     Constitutional Reference No 1 of 2008 reported in [2009] 1 LRC 453,

     which held that where a country has a written Constitution, the courts always

     have the jurisdiction to remedy breaches of the Constitution. The said
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 328 of 414
decision was also accepted by the Court of Appeal of Vanuatu in Republic

    of Vanuatu v Carcasses reported in [2010] 2 LRC 264 which held that

    while a court will not otherwise inquire into or adjudicate upon issues arising

    in Parliament, it would be empowered to interpret and determine whether

    there has been a breach of a constitutional right.
b. Where the Governor reserves a bill for the consideration of the President

    and the President in turn withholds assent thereto then, it shall be open

    to the State Government to assail such an action before this Court. Such

    a challenge can broadly be made on the following grounds:
376. The special object fulfilled by
Article 201
and the important position it

    occupies in maintaining the quasi-federal structure of the country has been

    explained in detail by this Court in Kaiser-I-Hind (supra) as follows:
380. As regards the issue of delay under
Article 201
, as we have discussed in the

     preceding paragraphs, the Sarkaria Commission observed that the delay in

     the expeditious disposal of bills reserved for the consideration of the

     President was one of the major causes of strain in Centre-State relations. It

     also recommended that definite timelines must be adopted for facilitating

     the efficient disposal of references under
Article 201.
The timelines
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 348 of 414
suggested by the Commission are indicated in paragraph 120 of this

     judgment.
381. Besides prescribing timelines, the Commission also suggested that the

     reference being made by the Governor must be self-contained and contain

     all necessary information. We have discussed that the same was also

     observed by this Court in Kaiser-I-Hind (supra) in the context of references

     being made under
Article 254(2).
The reading of a timeline in
Article 201
was also suggested by the Punchhi Commission.
387. Another office memorandum was issued by the Ministry of Home Affairs to

    all the States/UTs on the same date in this regard and is reproduced below:
4. It has also been observed that many a time the Bill etc,
        contains drafting errors and State Governments, despite
        repeated persuasion, do not withdraw such Bills. Since a Bill
        containing errors cannot be presented to the President, State
        Governments are requested to kindly verify and check that a
        Bill is free from any drafting/typographical error. It is also
        observed that many a time the State Governments agree to
        make amendments as per the suggestions of Central
        Ministries/Departments, but still keeps on insisting for assent
        of the Bill in its original form. It is therefore requested that
        once the State Government tends to agree with the objections/
        views of the Central Departments/Ministries, the State
        Government may consider sending a consolidated proposal
        alongwith suggested amendments/modifications instead of
        insisting for assent of the Bill in their original form
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 356 of 414
388. The aforesaid memorandum then clarifies that when the appropriate

    Ministry at the Centre, which is concerned with the substantive issues,

    makes any objections, the same is then shared with the concerned State

    government for further seeking their views or clarifications on the matter.

    This is done with the object of apprising the concerned Central Ministry of

    the clarifications of the State government on the matter. A time-limit of one

    month has been prescribed for the same. As aspect of concern highlighted

    herein was the inaction or delayed action on part of the State government to

    furnish these relevant clarifications which further has the ripple effect of

    postponing the decision of the Centre on the matter. It was further prescribed

    that the State Governments must rectify any drafting or typographical errors

    pointed out by the Central Government and once the suggestions of the

    Central Government are accepted, the State governments should send a
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 357 of 414
consolidated proposal containing the amendments rather than insisting on

     the assent to bill in the original form.
393. This Court in
State of Punjab
(supra) had reached the conclusion that the

    option of withholding of assent under the substantive part of
Article 200
would be tethered to the first proviso thereto, predominantly because of the

    clear use of the expression “shall not withhold assent therefrom” therein. It

    is limpid that an identical expression remains absent in the proviso to Article
397. The natural corollary of the constitutional abhorrence to the notion of

    simpliciter withholding of assent within our Constitution is that a

    requirement and responsibility of assigning reasons to the withholding of

    assent is cast upon the President. What follows from this is that the reasons

    assigned by the President for withholding of assent must be communicated

    to the State government concerned. Such an inference is legitimate since

    there remains no logic in assigning reasons if the same cannot be responded

    to and addressed by the State government. Putting the State government to

    proper notice of the reconsiderations or amendments to the bill, which the

    Council of Ministers at the Centre may have, is also an essential obligation

    inhered in such situations. In the absence of such communication, there
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                     Page 362 of 414
exists a real and grave danger of denying the State government the

    knowledge of the reasons due to which the bill passed by the State legislature

    had not been assented to. Furthermore, there may exist situations where the

    State governments may be amenable to some remedial changes or

    amendments. However, in the absence of any communication, they may be

    robbed of any chance to undertake those changes and ensure that the bill

    becomes law in their State. The State governments must not be prevented

    from entertaining or possibly incorporating the changes or amendments to

    the bill which was originally referred to the President, solely due to the

    absence of a transparent information sharing mechanism, which the State

    government may be said to be entitled to in a federal polity. Entertaining

    such a dialogue assumes importance since the fulcrum of a healthy Centre-

    State relations, in a constitutional democracy, is the transparent

    collaboration and cooperation between the Union and the States.
406. In cases where the reservation is on the ground of repugnancy of the State

    legislation with a Central legislation, or under one of the provisions where

    the assent of President has been envisaged for the purpose of enforceability

    or imparting immunity to the legislation, it would be a matter where the

    President would decide the question of grant of assent keeping in mind the

    desirability of having a uniformity in the policy across the country on the

    subject matter involved. This, as was held in Kaiser-I-Hind (supra), is

    evident from the fact that the assent under
Article 201
is not the same as the

    assent to be granted under
Articles 111
and
201
, and the President has been

    given supremacy under the Constitution as regards the bills covered under
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 368 of 414
Article 201
by virtue of his constituent powers. In this regard, the

observations of the Sarkaria Commission may be referred to as guiding

principles by the President wherein it was observed thus:
5.10.06 We recommend that as a matter of convention, the
        President should not withhold assent only on the
        consideration of policy differences on matters relating, in
        pith and substance, to the State List, except on the grounds of
        patent unconstitutionality such as those indicated in para
        5.6.13 above.”
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 370 of 414
414. The object of
Article 143
in context of reference of bills, whose

    constitutionality is under consideration by the President under
Article 201
,

    has been explained by the N.L. Untwalia, J., In Re: The Special Courts Bill,

    1978 reported in (1979) 1 SCC 380. The relevant portion of his judgment is

    reproduced below:
416. The approach to be adopted by the courts in answering references under
Article 143
in respect of reserved bills also requires a perusal of

    constitutional provisions viz.
Articles 31A
, 31C
, 254
, 288
, 360
, etc. that

    place a requirement of assent to a bill by the President, either expressly or

    by necessary implication. The scope of these Articles is largely centred

    around social, economic and political objectives that are sought to be

    achieved by a State. The necessity for Presidential assent in case of

    legislations under these Articles is for enabling the Central government to
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                     Page 376 of 414
streamline policies and ensure uniformity in socio-economic and welfare

     measures across States. In contemplation of the bills under these Articles,

     the central government, more often than not, has policy considerations in

     mind and the reasons for assent or withholding thereof may not be on purely

     legal grounds.
418. The exercise of a self-imposed restraint by the court in matters involving

     purely political considerations is in consonance with the doctrine of political

     thicket, that is, the courts do not venture into areas of governance in which

     the Constitution gives a prerogative solely to the executive. For instance, the

     question whether a State legislation repugnant to a central law should be

     assented to by the President or not under
Article 254(2)
is largely a policy

     decision on part of the Union Government. In such matters, the court has its
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 377 of 414
hands tied and does not attempt to encroach into the functions of the

    executive wing.
419. However, in certain exceptional circumstances, the Governor may reserve a

    bill for consideration of the President on grounds that the bill is perilous to

    the principles of democracy and an interpretation of the Constitution is

    necessary to ascertain whether such legislation should be granted assent or

    not. In such cases where a bill has been reserved majorly on the grounds of

    not being in consonance with the constitutional principles and involves

    questions of constitutional validity, the executive is supposed to exercise

    restraint. It is expected that the Union executive should not assume the role

    of the courts in determining the vires of a bill and should, as a matter of

    practice, refer such question to the Supreme Court under
Article 143.
We

    have no qualms in stating that the hands of the executive are tied when

    engaging with purely legal issues in a bill and only the constitutional courts

    have the prerogative to study and provide recommendations as regards the

    constitutionality of a bill.
420. Since the constitutionality of a bill is a matter which falls within the

    exclusive domain of the courts, the opinion rendered by the Supreme Court

    under
Article 143
holds high persuasive value and should ordinarily be

    accepted by the legislature and the executive. We are no strangers to the

    arguments as regards the non-binding nature of the advisory jurisdiction of
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 378 of 414
this Court and that even though a bill may be referred to this Court by the

    President under
Article 143
, yet the opinion delivered thereunder may not

    be heeded to. However, merely because the jurisdiction under
Article 143
is

    not binding does not undermine the principles used by this Court to

    determine the constitutionality of the bill. This Court in Re Special Courts

    (supra) has held thus:
421. In our considered view, the only reason for which the legislative or the

    executive wing may not take note of the opinion delivered by the Supreme

    Court under
Article 143
is when the grounds on which a State bill was
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 379 of 414
reserved for the consideration of the President, are not purely legal but also

     involve certain policy considerations, which may outweigh the issue of

     constitutionality. In such cases, if the President acts contrary to the advice

     of this Court and withholds assent to a bill, he must record cogent reasons

     and materials that justify not granting assent.
425. Thus, as a matter of prudence, the States should enter into pre-legislation

       consultation with the Central government before introducing legislations on

       matters pertaining to those provisions of the Constitution where the assent

       of the President may be required. Likewise, the Central government, should

       consider the legislative proposals sent by the State governments with due

       regard and expediency. Such a practice reduces friction between Centre-

       State relations and also ensures that future roadblocks are overcome in the

       beginning itself, thereby promoting public welfare.
427. A three-Judge Bench of this Court in A.G. Perarivalan (supra) was dealing

       with the inaction on the part of the Governor of Tamil Nadu in deciding the

       remission petition of the petitioner therein. Despite the resolution passed by

       the State government in favour of granting remission to the petitioner, the

       Governor first kept the matter pending with him for a long duration and
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 382 of 414
thereafter, without taking a decision thereupon, referred the same to the

    President.
428. The Court, taking into consideration the huge delay caused by inaction on

    the part of the Governor, and also the adverse impact of such inaction on the

    liberty of the petitioner therein, exercised its powers under
Article 142
of

    the Constitution and deemed the petitioner to have served his sentence and

    ordered his release forthwith. The Court observed thus:
429. The Court, while summarizing its observations, further observed that the

    reference made by the Governor to the President had no constitutional

    backing and therefore the reference having been declared erronoeus, and the

    Council of Ministers having advised in the favour of remission, there was
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 383 of 414
no requirement to remand the matter to the Governor for taking a decision

     thereupon. The observations read thus:
434. In light of the aforesaid discussion, we answer the questions of law

     formulated by us as under:
(II)     The first proviso to
Article 200
should be read in conjunction with

              the option of withholding of assent provided in the substantive part

              of
Article 200.
It is not an independent course of action and has to

              be mandatorily initiated by the Governor in cases where the option
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 387 of 414
of withholding of assent is to be exercised. The decision of this

         Court in
State of Punjab
(supra) lays down the correct position of

         law in this regard.
(III)    The expression “the bill falls through unless the procedure under

         the first proviso is followed” as used in
Valluri Basavaiah

         Chowdhary
(supra) signifies that once the Governor declares

         withholding of assent and returns the bill to the House or Houses,

         the bill would lapse or fall through unless the House or Houses

         reconsider the bill in accordance with the suggestions made by the

         Governor in his message and present it to him after repassing. The

         expression “unless the procedure under the first proviso is

         followed” cannot be construed to mean that the Governor exercises

         discretion in setting the machinery prescribed under the first

         proviso in motion. Once the Governor exercises the option of

         withholding assent, he is under an obligation to follow the

         procedure prescribed in the first proviso “as soon as possible”.
(IV)     The decision of this Court in
State of Punjab
(supra) cannot be said

         to be per incuriam.
The observations made in the decision as

         regards attaching of the first proviso with the option of withholding

         of assent are supported by the observations made in
Valluri

         Basavaiah Chowdhary
(supra).
(VIII) In the facts of the present case, the reservation by the Governor of

         the ten Bills for the consideration of the President in the second

         round was illegal, erroneous in law and is thus liable to be set aside.
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 390 of 414
As a result, any subsequent action taken upon the said Bills by the

         President also does not survive and is thus set aside.


(IX)     The Bills, having been pending with the Governor for an unduly

         long period of time, and the Governor having acted with clear lack

         of bona fides in reserving the Bills for the consideration of the

         President, immediately after the pronouncement of the decision of

         this Court in
State of Punjab
(supra), are deemed to have been

         assented to by the Governor on the date when they were presented

         to him after being reconsidered.
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                         Page 391 of 414
(XII)    The settled position of law is that where no time-limit for the

         exercise of a power is prescribed, the same must be exercised in a

         reasonable time period. Guided by the decisions of this Court in

         A.G. Perarivalan (supra) and
Keisham
(supra), we find that it is

         no more res-integra that the courts are well-empowered to

         prescribe a time-limit for the discharge of any function or exercise

         of any power which, by its very nature, demands expediency.



(XIII) Prescription of a general time-limit by this Court, within which the

         ordinary exercise of power by the Governor under
Article 200
must

         take place, is not the same thing as amending the text of the

         Constitution to read in a time-limit which would fundamentally

         change the procedure and mechanism stipulated by
Article 200.
Prescription of such time-limits within the scheme of
Article 200
is

         with a view to lay down a determinable judicial standard for

         ascertaining the reasonable exercise of such power and to curtail

         any arbitrary inaction. This Court while prescribing a time-limit for

         the exercise of power, is guided by the inherent expedient nature of

         the procedure prescribed under
Article 200.
(XIV)    Keeping in mind the constitutional significance of
Article 200
and

         the role it plays in the federal polity of the country, the following
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 392 of 414
timelines are being prescribed. Failure to comply with these

         timelines would make the inaction of the Governors subject to

         judicial review by the courts:
(iii) In case of reservation of bills for the consideration of the

                President contrary to the advice of the State Council of

                Ministers, the Governor shall make such reservation within

                a maximum period of three months;
(XVI)    We declare the view taken in
B.K. Pavitra
(supra) to be per

         incuriam to the extent of the following two observations made

         therein – First, that the Constitution confers discretion upon the

         Governor insofar as the reservation of bills for the consideration of

         the President is concerned and; Secondly, that the exercise of

         discretion by the Governor under
Article 200
is beyond judicial

         scrutiny.
The decision of
B.K. Pavitra
(supra) is not in consonance

         with the observations made by the larger bench decision of this

         Court in
Samsher Singh
(supra).
The majority opinion in
Samsher

         Singh
(supra) in paragraph 28 observed that “Governor is the

         constitutional or formal head of the State and he exercises all his

         powers and functions conferred on him by or under the Constitution

         on the aid and advice of his Council of Ministers save in spheres

         where the Governor is required by or under the Constitution to

         exercise his functions in his discretion” At the cost of repetition,

         we again reiterate “and he exercises all his powers and functions

         conferred on him by or under the Constitution on the aid and

         advice of his Council of Ministers”.
The decision in
Samsher Singh
(supra) illustrated certain

         provisions of the Constitution which expressly required the

         Governor to exercise his powers in his discretion. The second

         proviso to
Article 200
was one such illustration.
Thus, it is amply

         clear from the dictum in
Samsher Singh
(supra) that the seven-

         Judge Bench, after taking into consideration the scheme of
Article
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                     Page 395 of 414
200
, observed that the second proviso to
Article 200
was the only

         instance where the Governor had been entrusted with the power to

         act in his own discretion.
Subsequent Constitution Bench decisions

         in M.P. Special Police (supra) and Nabam Rebia (supra) clarified

         that besides the instances where the Governor has been expressly

         conferred with discretionary powers, there may still be certain

         exceptional circumstances wherein it would be legitimate for him

         to act in his own discretion as indicated by us in paragraph 300.

         However, the general rule remains that the Governor acts upon the

         aid and advice of the State Council of Ministers.
The observations made in
B.K. Pavitra
(supra) that “a

         discretion is conferred upon the Governor to follow one of the

         courses of action enunciated in the substantive part of Article 200”

         do not take into consideration the decision of
Samsher Singh
(supra) and is for this reason per incuriam.
It failed to consider that
Article 200
which had been duly considered by
Samsher Singh
(supra) was found to contain only one instance where the exercise

         of discretion was expressly provided, that being the second proviso

         thereto. Besides this, as already aforestated, it failed to notice the

         removal of the expression “in his discretion” from Section 75 of

         the GoI Act, 1935 which ultimately culminated into
Article 200.
(XVII) Under
Article 201
, the occasion for the reservation of a bill for the

         consideration of the President by the Governor may arise where a

         constitutional provision makes the assent of the President to be a

         condition precedent to a State legislation becoming enforceable or

         for the purpose of securing some immunity to the State legislation.

         Such a requirement can be found in
Articles 31A
, 31C
, 254(2)
,
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 397 of 414
288(2)
, 360(4)(a)(ii)
etc. The second proviso to
Article 200
also

         makes reservation for the consideration of the President mandatory.

         As we have also discussed, there may be certain other situations

         where by peril to fundamental principles of representative

         democracy, the Governor may, in exercise of his discretion, reserve

         a bill for the consideration of the President.
(XXII) The determining factor in deciding whether a power would be

         subject to judicial review is the subject-matter of such power and

         not its source.
Indra Sawhney
(supra) observed that the yardstick

         of subjecting an act or a decision to judicial review is not whether

         it is a legislative act or an executive decision on a policy matter but

         whether it violates any constitutional guarantee or the rights under

         Part III of the Constitution. The Governor, wherever he acts in his
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 400 of 414
discretion under the Constitution, does so by virtue of his position

         as the constitutional and formal head of the State. It has been held

         in a catena of decisions that exercise of any power under the

         Constitution must conform to the limits set by the Constitution

         itself.
Article 200
is no exception to this general rule.
(XXIII) In light of this, the observations made by this Court in
Hoechst
(supra) that the assent of the President is non-justiciable, cannot be

         stretched to mean that as a general rule, the exercise of powers by

         the Governor under
Article 200
in his discretion would also be

         immune from judicial review. While grant of assent by the

         Governor or the President, being acts which are generally taken

         upon the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers, may not be

         justiciable, the withholding of assent or reservation of bills for the

         consideration of the President by the Governor in exercise of his

         discretion which is subject to the limits defined by the Constitution,

         would be justiciable on the touchstone of judicially determinable

         standards.
This question being purely of a legal nature would be

                     completely justiciable and the competent court would

                     be, after a proper adjudication, fully authorized to

                     approve or disapprove of such reservation by the

                     Governor. If such a challenge finds favour with the

                     competent    court,   then,   subject    to     any    other
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                          Page 402 of 414
considerations, it would be a fit case for the issuance of

                     a writ in the nature of mandamus to the Governor for

                     appropriate action. If, however, the challenge should

                     fail then the mechanism envisaged under
Article 201
of

                     the Constitution will spring into action.
(v)      Where the Governor exhibits inaction in making a

                     decision when a bill is presented to him for assent under
Article 200
and such inaction exceeds the time-limit as

                     has been prescribed by us in paragraph 250 of this

                     judgment then it shall be open to the State Government

                     to seek a writ of mandamus from a competent court

                     against the Governor directing expeditious decision on

                     the concerned bill as is the mandate of the Constitution,

                     however, it is clarified that the Governor may

                     successfully resist such a challenge on providing

                     sufficient explanation for the delay caused.
b. Where the Governor reserves a bill for the consideration of the

            President and the President in turn withholds assent thereto then,

            it shall be open to the State Government to assail such an action

            before this Court. Such a challenge can broadly be made on the

            following grounds:
436. We are in no way undermining the office of the Governor. All we say is that

     the Governor must act with due deference to the settled conventions of

     parliamentary democracy; respecting the will of the people being expressed

     through the legislature as-well as the elected government responsible to the

     people. He must perform his role of a friend, philosopher and guide with

     dispassion, guided not by considerations of political expediency but by the

     sanctity of the constitutional oath he undertakes. In times of conflict, he must

     be the harbinger of consensus and resolution, lubricating the functioning of

     the State machinery by his sagacity, wisdom and not run it into a standstill.

     He must be the catalyst and not an inhibitor. All his actions must be impelled

     keeping in mind the dignity of the high constitutional office that he occupies.
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 409 of 414
.......................................................... J.
(J.B. Pardiwala)




                                           .......................................................... J.STATE LIST
             Entry 32 -- Incorporation, regulation and winding up of
             corporations, other than those specified in List-I and
             Universities;
7.   The Governor, on 04.12.2023, also sought to clarify that the 10 Bills to

     which he had withheld assent simpliciter were not returned to the Legislature

     for reconsideration as stipulated in the first proviso of
Article 200.
Despite

     that, the State Government had placed the Bills before the legislative

     assembly again. After the Bills were repassed by the legislative assembly,

     the State Government sent the same back to the Governor for assent. The

     Governor clarified that since the Bills suffered from repugnancy, he was

     reserving the said Bills for the consideration of the President. These

     clarifications were sent for all the 10 Bills. For reference, we have extracted
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                         Page 8 of 414
the relevant portion of the letter pertaining to the Tamil Nadu Fisheries

University (Amendment) Bill, 2023 which reads thus:
5.⁠ ⁠The Hon'ble Governor had not returned the Bills under the
             proviso to
Article 200
for re-consideration, however, State
             Government has sent them back. Since the Bill suffers from
             repugnancy, Hon'ble Governor has reserved the same for the
             consideration of the Hon'ble President.”
9.   Thus, what was sought to be conveyed by the aforesaid I.A. was that the 10

     Bills were reconsidered and passed again by the State Legislature and were

     thereafter forwarded to the Governor for his assent in terms of the first

     proviso to
Article 200.
However, the Governor reserved the said Bills for

     the consideration of the President. It was alleged that such action on the part

     of the Governor was violative of
Article 200
and was done with a mala fide

     intention only with a view to circumvent the jurisdiction of this Court.
28. Consequently, the petitioner was constrained to file I.A. No. 69967 of 2024

    on 18.03.2024 to amend its prayer in the present writ petition for including

    the relief of staying the operation of the Governor’s letter dated 17.03.2024

    and directing him to administer the oath of office and secrecy to Dr. K.

    Ponmudy. The amendment sought to be made reads thus:
iv)    He submitted that even the withholding of assent by the President

          under
Article 201
was by way of a non-speaking order and thus

          does not comply with the first proviso to the Article. Similar to
Article 200
, the withholding of assent under
Article 201
must

          necessarily result in a message under the first proviso. He

          summarised his arguments on this aspect by submitting that the acts

          of simpliciter withholding, reserving for the consideration of the

          President, delay by Governor, as well as simpliciter withholding of
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                         Page 27 of 414
assent by the President are all unconstitutional, and hence null and

         void.
iv)
Article 200
embodies an aspect of legislative procedure so as to

          make a Bill operative as an Act. Seen thus, it is imperative that the

          Governor acts upon the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers

          when exercising his power under
Article 200.
v)     Taking us through the historical background in which
Article 200
came to be drafted, Mr. Dwivedi submitted that Section 75 was the

          provision corresponding to
Article 200
in the
Government of India

          Act, 1935
. However, in Section 75 the expressions “Governor in
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 30 of 414
his discretion” and “Governor may, in his discretion” were

         deployed in the substantive part and the proviso respectively. Later

         on, when the draft of the Constitution was prepared by the

         constitutional advisor, the expression “Governor in his discretion”

         was dropped from the substantive part of
Article 147 (predecessor

         of draft
Article 175
), but the expression “Governor may, in his

         discretion” was retained in the proviso. The same position

         continued in
Article 175
of the Draft Constitution, 1948

         (hereinafter, “the Draft Constitution”) (predecessor of Article
vii) The interpretation of
Article 200
must be done in line with the

         intent of the framers of the Constitution which is evident from the

         Constituent Assembly Debates. The only instance where this Court

         adopted an approach contrary to the one suggested by the

         Constituent Assembly pertained to the appointment of Judges to the

         High Court and this Court and that approach was adopted to

         preserve the independence of the judiciary, which is part of the

         basic structure. However, in the present case, there is no compelling

         need to diverge from the view adopted by the Constituent Assembly

         as that view supports the fundamental principles of federalism.
d) Option of withholding of assent is attached to the first proviso to
Article 200.
b) The Governor cannot reserve a bill for the consideration of the
   President when it is repassed by the State Legislature, with or
   without amendments, under the first proviso to
Article 200?
iii)   Explaining the reason for the aforesaid, he submitted that upon

          exercising the second option, the third option no longer remains for

          the Governor as the first proviso to
Article 200
comes into

          operation.
Article 200
does not provide any scope to the Governor

          for the reservation of the bill once the second option has already

          been exercised. The decision of the Governor to go down the path

          of sending the bill back to the Legislature precludes him from

          reversing his constitutional election subsequently, by referring it to

          the President after the Bill is returned to him consequent to

          repassing by the Legislature.
c) The first proviso to
Article 200
is attached to the option of
   withholding of assent provided in the substantive part of the article.
i)    The concluding part of the first proviso stipulates that if the Bill is

         passed again by the Legislature either with or without amendments,

         the Governor shall not withhold assent therefrom upon

         presentation. The expression “shall not withhold assent therefrom”

         is a clear indicator that the exercise of the power under the first

         proviso is relatable to the withholding of the assent by the Governor

         to the bill in the first instance. This phrase constitutes a clear and

         unequivocal constitutional prohibition against the Governor. The

         role which is ascribed by the first proviso to the Governor is

         recommendatory in nature and it does not bind the State

         Legislature.
ii)   The first proviso to
Article 200
expands upon the second option to

         ensure that the object of the Article is not rendered otiose as without

         the first proviso,
Article 200
would allow the Governor to

         indiscriminately veto bills by repetitively and sequentially

         withholding the assent and cripple an elected Government for

         political reasons.
vii) Once the first proviso comes into operation, the State Legislature is

           bound to mandatorily reconsider the Bills and pass them with or

           without any amendments as indicated by the expression “House or

           Houses shall reconsider the Bill accordingly” in the second part of

           the first proviso to
Article 200.
d)        A time-limit must be read into the expression “as soon as
          possible” appearing in the first proviso to
Article 200
to curtail
          the prevalent practice of gubernatorial procrastination.
limit is fixed, it has to be exercised within a time which can be

            held to be reasonable.
f) Role of the President under
Article 201.
iii)   Just as the Governor, the President is also bound by the aid and

          advice of his Council of Ministers under
Article 201
of the

          Constitution. Such absence of compulsion of the President to grant

          assent to the Bill re-considered and repassed by the State

          Legislative Assembly is also subject to the aid and advice of the

          Council of Ministers. Whether the President should grant assent or

          not would be subject to the aid and advice by the Council of
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                         Page 50 of 414
Ministers. There is no individual discretion vested in the President

         in granting or not granting the assent under
Article 201.
i. Whether the first proviso could be said to provide an independent

                 course of action available to the Governor in addition to the three

                 options provided under the substantive part of
Article 200?
ii. In what manner the expression “the Bill falls through unless the

                 procedure under the first proviso is followed”, as used in
Valluri

                 Basavaiah Chowdhary
(supra), should be construed?
II)    Whether the Governor can reserve a bill for the consideration of
       the President at the time when it is presented to him for assent after
       being reconsidered in accordance with the first proviso to
Article
       200
, more particularly, when he had not reserved it for the
       consideration of the President in the first instance and had
       declared withholding of assent thereto?
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 62 of 414
i. How is the absence of an express time-limit in
Article 200
to be

          construed for ascertaining the manner in which the Governor is

          expected to exercise his powers under the said provision?

      ii. What is the import of the expression “as soon as possible”

          appearing in the first proviso to
Article 200?
37.
Article 200
appears in Chapter III of Part VI of the Constitution under the

      heading Legislative Procedure. Part VI deals with the States and Chapter III

      deals with the State Legislature. The marginal note attached to
Article 200
reads “Assent to Bills” and the article reads as follows:
38.
Section 75
of the Government of India Act, 1935 (for short, “the GoI Act,

    1935”) upon which the
Article 200
has been substantially modelled is

    reproduced hereinbelow:
39. A perusal of both the aforesaid provisions indicates that
Article 200
of the

     Constitution corresponds to Section 75 of the GoI Act, 1935 except for the

     following differences:
41.
Article 200
is divided into three parts - the substantive part and two provisos.
A perusal of the substantive part of
Article 200
indicates that the

     presentation of a bill to the Governor is mandatory after it is passed by the

     State legislature. The same is made evident from the use of the expression

     “it shall be presented to the Governor”. In the same breath,
Article 200
makes it mandatory for the Governor to make one of the following

     declarations:
43. The first proviso to
Article 200
has no application to Money Bills. For all

    other bills, it provides that the Governor may, as soon as possible after the

    presentation of the bill to him for assent, return the bill to the House or

    Houses along with a message requesting the House or the Houses to

    reconsider the bill in totality or certain provisions thereof. He may also

    recommend the introduction of certain amendments to the bill. The first

    proviso further states that when a bill is returned with such a message, then

    the House or the Houses must reconsider the bill accordingly and if the bill

    is passed with or without amendments and presented to the Governor for

    assent, he shall not withhold assent therefrom.
44. The second proviso to
Article 200
provides that if the Governor is of the

    opinion that a bill which is presented to him for assent would, upon

    becoming law, so derogate from the powers of the High Court as to endanger

    the position which that Court is designed to fill by the Constitution, then he

    must reserve the bill for the consideration of the President and not grant

    assent to it.
45. The heart of the controversy before us lies in the interpretation of the

    substantive part of
Article 200
and the first proviso to it. The arguments

    advanced before us coupled with the factual situation which we are

    confronted with, and the broader constitutional and political consequences
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 70 of 414
that an interpretation of
Article 200
entails, has opened up before us a

     treasure trove of questions hidden in the seemingly innocuous and plain

     language used in
Article 200.
46. For a better understanding of
Article 200
, it is necessary that we should first

     understand the concept of assent to bills, how it has evolved over the

     centuries and its importance in parliamentary democracies across the globe.

     We are undertaking this exercise as
Article 200
cannot be understood fully

     without having regard to the context in which it came to be included in the

     Constitution. While fidelity to the text of the provision holds paramount

     consideration in its interpretation, the context is equally, if not more,

     important, more so in light of the fact that
Article 200
, as its stands today,

     bears striking resemblance to Section 75 of the GoI Act, 1935 and other

     important historical documents which were being drafted by Indians during

     the course of the freedom struggle.
47. In Westminster styled polities, the Parliament consists of a lower House, an

     upper House and the head of state. The Indian Constitution has also broadly

     adopted a similar structure, which becomes evident from
Articles 79
and
168
respectively.
Article 79
provides that the Parliament shall consist of the

     President and two Houses - the Council of States and the House of the

     People.
Article 168
provides that each State shall have a Legislature which
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 71 of 414
shall comprise of the Governor and either one or two House(s), as the case

      may be. In the Westminster system, for a law to be passed by the Parliament,

      it must receive the approval of all the three elements - the Lower House, the

      Upper House and the Head of the State.
50. One of the first instances where the concept of assent to bills appears in a

     documented form in the Indian context is the Constitution of India Bill, 1895
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 73 of 414
which is also popularly referred to as the Swaraj Bill. The Bill, which is also

    termed by the academics as the first articulation of a constitutional

    imagination by Indians, besides incorporating ideas of free speech, equality

    before law, right to property, etc., also envisaged a machinery of governance

    and separation of powers, albeit within the British Empire. As regards the

    legislative structure, the Bill proposed that the Sovereign of Great Britain

    shall reign and rule over India and the Viceroy shall be the representative of

    the Sovereign in India. It further envisaged that the Viceroy would be the

    President of the Parliament and would have the power to veto any law

    enacted by the Indian Parliament and initiate legislation.
Article 97
of the

    Bill provided that no bill would become law until it received the sanction of

    the Sovereign. The said provision is reproduced hereinbelow:
1. The head of every Provincial Government shall be a
        Governor who shall not ordinarily belong to the Indian Civil
        Service or any of the permanent services.
52. In the backdrop of the growing demand for self-government by the Indian

    National Movement and the Montagu-Chelmsford Report, the Government

    of India Act, 1919 (for short, “the GoI Act, 1919”) was enacted and received

    assent of the British Crown in December, 1919. The legislation introduced

    dyarchy at the provincial level, by the introduction of the transferred list and

    the reserved list. The reserved list consisted of the subject matters on which

    the Governor enjoyed exclusive legislative powers. However, what we wish

    to draw attention to is the provision contained in the said legislation as

    regards assent to bills.
Section 12
provided that the Governor had four

    options to choose from when a bill was presented to him for assent - to

    declare assent, to withhold assent, to return the bill to the council for

    reconsideration or to reserve the bill for the consideration of the Governor-

    General. Notably, there was no requirement for the Governor to mandatorily

    assent to a bill upon its presentation after reconsideration. Further, the

    Governor had the power to veto any bill passed by the legislative council by

    a declaration simplicter of withholding of assent. There was also a provision

    for the lapse of a bill reserved for the consideration of the Governor-General

    if assent was not granted within a period of six months. Thus, the concept of

    both absolute and pocket veto could be said to have been available to the

    Governor and the Governor-General under the provisions of the GoI Act,

    1919. The relevant provision is reproduced hereinbelow:
governor or chief commissioner relating thereto, the
            Bill, if re-affirmed with or without amendment, may
            be again presented to the governor, lieutenant-
53. A reading of the aforesaid provision also indicates that at the time of drafting
Article 200
, the framers of the Constitution not only had before them Section

     75 of the GoI Act, 1935 but also Section 12 of the GoI Act, 1919 as well as

     other possible variations about which we shall discuss in the following

     paragraphs. However, certain features of
Article 200
, namely, the absence

     of automatic lapse upon not receiving approval, mandatory requirement for

     the Governor to not withhold assent to a bill which is presented to him after

     being reconsidered by the legislature and absence of the expression “in his

     discretion”, must be viewed in the context of gradual dilution of the role and
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                         Page 78 of 414
powers of the Governor in provincial governance as the country neared

         independence.
54. The concept of assent by the Sovereign found mention in Section 75 of the

         GoI Act, 1935 and
Article 200
as it stands today is predominantly modelled

         according to the version which existed therein. However, before we proceed

         to discuss Section 75 of the GoI Act, 1935 and how it eventually evolved

         into
Article 200
of the Constitution, we deem it appropriate to briefly shed

         light on how other aspirational constitutional documents, drafted during the

         course of the freedom struggle, imagined the practice of assent to bills and

         made certain modifications to the practice that prevailed in the United

         Kingdom.
55. The Commonwealth of India Bill, 1925 that was drafted by the National

         Convention had a lasting impact on the eventual framing of our Constitution

         as regards the idea of royal assent.
Article 39
of the said Bill provided that a

         bill passed by the Parliament would be presented to the Viceroy for

         obtaining the King’s assent. Similarly, for the provinces,
Article 83
provided

         that the bills passed by the provincial legislature would be presented to the

         Governor for obtaining the King’s assent. However, what is relevant to note
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                         Page 79 of 414
is that the provisions were not elaborate as regards the procedure and scope

     of powers of the Sovereign while taking a decision on the aspect of assent.
- to signify assent, to withhold assent or to reserve the bill for consideration

     by the British Crown. Notably, there was no obligation on the Governor-

     General to signify assent after a bill was repassed with or without the

     amendments suggested by him. The relevant provision is reproduced

     hereinbelow:
58. As regards the provincial legislature, a bill passed by the provincial

    legislature had to be assented to by the Governor before it would become an

    Act. The Governor had two options - to declare assent or to withhold assent.

    Notably, the Governor did not have the option to reserve the bill for the

    consideration of the Governor-General. However, every bill after receiving

    the assent of the Governor had to be mandatorily referred to and assented by

    the Governor-General failing which the Act would have no validity. Even

    after receiving the assent of the Governor-General, the Act could be
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 81 of 414
disallowed by the King and would thereupon become void. The relevant

    provisions are reproduced hereinbelow:
40. Where the Governor-General withholds his assent from
            any such Act, he shall signify to the Governor in writing his
            reason for so withholding his assent.
42. Where the disallowance of an Act has been so signified,
            the Governor shall forthwith notify the disallowance, and
            thereupon the Act, as from the date of the notification shall
            become void accordingly.”
60. A perusal of the above indicates that the Governor had the option of either

    assenting to or withholding a bill presented before him. However, in the

    latter case, the Governor was under an obligation to return the bill for

    reconsideration with his own recommendations, whereupon the provincial

    legislature was required to reconsider the bill in light of the

    recommendations made. Upon being passed again, with or without

    amendments, the bill would be deemed to have been assented to by the
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 83 of 414
Governor. However, it would become an Act only upon being assented to

    by the President, who would signify his assent to the Governor. Thus, the

    President was vested with the power to veto any bill which had not been

    assented to by the Governor and was passed again after reconsideration with

    or without the amendments recommended by the Governor. This was in

    contrast to the position with respect to the Federal Legislature, wherein no

    veto power was conferred on the President. The relevant provision read as

    follows:
63. Besides the aspirational constitutional documents
referred to above
, it is also

     pertinent to discuss how assent was envisaged by one of the first indigenous

     constitutional documents that was implemented in practice as well. Section

     15 of the Aundh State Constitution Act, 1939 that was purportedly enacted

     to grant self-rule to the people of the Aundh princely state, laid down the

     procedure for assent to bills. The relevant provision read as follows:
69.
Article 147
of the Draft Constitution, prepared by the constitutional adviser,

     Shri B.N. Rau, dealt with assent to bills passed by the provincial legislature

     and read as follows:
70.
Article 147
as reproduced aforesaid made significant departure from Section

    75 of the GoI Act, 1935 as follows:
ii.   Debates of the Constituent Assembly on
Article 200
of the Constitution
72. When
Article 175
of the Draft Constitution, 1948 was taken up for

      consideration by the Constituent Assembly, certain amendments were

      moved by Dr. B.R. Ambedkar that came to be accepted, leading to the

      adoption of the draft
Article 175
as
Article 200
of our Constitution. The

      amendments were:
77. Shri. T.T. Krishnamachari also emphasized that under the newly proposed

        draft
Article 175
, more specifically the first proviso, the Governor will not

        be exercising his discretion in the matter of referring a bill back to the House

        with a message. The Governor would exercise his power under the first

        proviso only upon the advice of his Council of Ministers. According to him,

        the first proviso was to be exercised in situations wherein the House has

        already accepted and endorsed a provision, but the Ministry was of the

        opinion that certain modifications are required to be made in the said

        provision. It is only when such an occasion arises that the procedure

W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                         Page 94 of 414
envisaged under the first proviso would be resorted to. The Council of

        Ministers would use the Governor to hold up further proceedings of the bill

        and remit it to the Lower House with the message informing the legislature

        about the modifications sought to be made to the bill by the Ministry. He

        drew attention to the words of Dr. Ambedkar on this aspect and stated as

        follows:
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                         Page 95 of 414
might have undertaken with respect to the bill in question, or, it could also

     be seen as providing some scope to the Ministry to take certain additional

     actions that the Ministry feels should be taken in order to meet the popular

     opinion reflected outside the House in some form or another. Therefore, the

     operation of the first proviso does not abridge the power of the Legislature

     or the Ministry responsible to it, rather, it further curtails the Governor’s

     power from the position that was envisaged in the original first proviso,

     which is now sought to be supplanted.
79. In light of the debate which took place as regards the substitution of the first

     proviso to draft
Article 175
, the amendment was put to vote and the same

     was successfully adopted by the Constituent Assembly.
80. On 17th of October, 1949, T.T. Krishnamachari moved an amendment that a

     second proviso to
Article 175
also be added, which later came to be adopted

     by the Constituent Assembly. Dr. B.R. Ambedkar elucidated that the second

     proviso that was proposed to be moved, was a part of the Instrument of

     Instructions issued to the Governor of the provinces under the GoI, 1935.

     Paragraph 17 of the Instrument of Instructions read as follows:
82. It was the opinion of Dr. B.R. Ambedkar that any such bill or Act as

        illustrated above would amount to a derogation from the authority that the

        Constitution confers or intends to confer upon the High Court. This is why

        it was felt necessary that before such a law becomes final, the President must

        be given an opportunity to examine whether such a law should be permitted

        to take effect or not. Such a shield was considered imperative keeping in

        mind the important constitutional position that the High Courts hold in

        adjudicating disputes. Dr. B.R. Ambedkar had emphasized on the

        importance of the second proviso as follows:
i.    First Administrative Reforms Commission, 1966.
87. As the discretionary powers of the Governor affect some of the vital issues

    in the functioning of democratic governments in the States, the ARC

    underscored the importance of evolving guidelines to enable the exercise of

    such discretionary powers for the purpose of preserving and protecting

    democratic values. It was noted that such guidelines would serve the purpose

    of securing uniformity in action and eliminate all suspicions of partisanship

    and arbitrariness.
93. The Commission observed that while exercising his functions, the Governor

    should not be under any pressure from an external authority. To explain the

    position of discretionary powers of the Governor, the Commission referred

    to the speech of the former Vice President of India, Shri G.S. Pathak, which

    reads thus:
102. A discussion of the recommendations of the Commission in this regard

     would be beneficial to our examination of
Articles 200
and
201
respectively

     and the role of the Governor in the contemporary federal polity.



a.    Scope of Governor’s Discretion Under
Article 200
106. While addressing suggestions of some State governments that the

     discretionary powers of the Governor must be curtailed or removed as it

     presents a potential threat to the autonomy of the States, the Commission

     observed that the makers of the Constitution advisedly refrained from

     putting such discretionary powers in a straitjacket rigid definition. It noted

     that the Constitution is ever evolving and the ways in which its provisions

     and principles may be tampered with or circumvented, cannot be foreseen.

     Therefore, the office of the Governor should be afforded enough flexibility

     to react in any situation and his discretion to approach a matter cannot be

     pre-determined.
b.    Interplay of
Articles 200
And
254
respectively of the Constitution.
107.
Article 246(2)
endows the Parliament as well as the State legislatures with

     the competence to legislate on entries under List III i.e., the concurrent list.

     The provision under
Article 254
is appurtenant to the concurrent exercise of
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 110 of 414
legislative competence by the Parliament and State legislature insofar as

     there is any inconsistency or repugnancy between the laws of the respective

     legislatures.
109. The Commission highlighted that clause (2) of
Article 254
is applicable only

     when the following two conditions are cumulatively met:
It is upon satisfaction of both these conditions that the Governor can reserve

     a bill for Presidential consideration under
Article 254(2).
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 111 of 414
c.    Scope of Union Executive’s Discretion under
Article 201
111. As per the report of the Commission, a State bill, once reserved for the

     consideration of the President (upon the aid and advice of the Council of

     Ministers), is made subject to the procedure prescribed under
Article 201
and the Union Executive is entitled to examine it from all angles such as,

     inter alia, conformity to legislative or executive policy of the Union,

     harmony with the scheme and provisions of the Constitution, vires of the

     bill, etc.
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                    Page 112 of 414
114. The Commission did not make any specific prescription in respect of
Article

     143
of the Constitution, which enables the President and by extension, the

     Union Council of Ministers to seek the opinion of the Supreme Court in
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 113 of 414
respect of bills which may be deemed to be unconstitutional and left the

     decision up to the President to make such a reference in appropriate cases.



d.    Impropriety of Conditional Assent by the President
117. The Commission, cognizant of the misgivings and irritations in Union-State

     relations due to delays in the process of securing Presidential assent,

     recommended that the procedure of making a reference to the President by

     the State Government through the Governor and the consideration thereof

     by the Union Government must be streamlined. It was also endorsed that the

     Governments at both the Centre and State level may benefit from a prior

     consultation at the stage of drafting of the bill itself and prescribing time-

     limits for disposal, which ought to be made convention and practice.
120. With regard to prescription of such timelines, the Commission proposed the

    following timelines to be treated as salutary conventions:
g.    Withholding of Assent by the President
h.    Recommendations given by the Commission
125. The Commission classified State bills to be reserved for the consideration of

     the President as follows:
(i)    To secure immunity from operation of
Articles 14
and
(a) acquisition of estates, etc. [First Proviso to
Article
                       31A(I)];
(b) giving effect to Directive Principles of State Policy
                       (Proviso to
Article 31C
).
(ii) A Bill relating to a subject enumerated in the
                   Concurrent List, to ensure operation of its provisions
                   despite their repugnancy to a Union law or an existing
                   law, by securing President's assent in terms of
Article
                   254(2).
(iii) Legislation imposing restrictions on trade and
                   commerce requiring Presidential sanction under the
                   Proviso to
Article 304(b)
read with
Article 255.
a.    Role of the Governor
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 122 of 414

b.    Discretionary Powers of the Governor
134. Upon a perusal of
Article 163(2)
, the Commission was of the view that the

     said provision gives the impression that the Governor has a wide and

     undefined area of discretionary powers. However, the scope of the

     discretionary powers of the Governor has to be narrowly construed. The

     language of
Article 163(2)
cannot be taken to mean that the Governor has a

     general discretionary power to act against the aid and advice of the Council

     of Ministers.


137. The Commission suggested that definite timelines ought to be adopted as

     salutary conventions for the Governor to either provide assent or reserve the

     bill for the consideration of the President. Similarly, there should be a time

     limit for the President to take a decision on the State bill under
Article 201
of the Constitution. The Commission was of the view that concrete timelines

     are sine qua non for the exercise of powers under
Articles 200
and
201
respectively so as to avoid dissensions between the Central and State

     governments.

138. The Commission noted that the substantive part of
Article 200
does not

     stipulate time period within which the Governor has to either assent,

     withhold assent or reserve the bill for Presidential consideration. The

     requirement of expediency is incumbent upon the Governor only when he

     decides to return the bill to the State legislature for reconsideration. The

     same was considered to be evident from the expression “as soon as

     possible”.
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 125 of 414
139. The Commission noted that while the expression “as soon as possible” is

    mentioned in
Article 200
albeit only in the first proviso thereof, there is no

    such compulsion on the President under
Article 201.
As a result, the

    President or the Union Government may kill the bill by not taking a decision

    on the same, sometimes for the entire duration of the State legislature. This

    increases the scope for abuse of discretion by the Union government based

    on political considerations particularly when the ruling party in the State

    concerned is different from the one enjoying power at the Union level. The

    lack of a reasonable timeline allows the executive fiat to make inroads into

    the legislative power of the State thereby thwarting the democratic will of

    the State legislature. Such invasion of the powers of the State legislature by

    the Union Executive is questionable in the context of ‘basic features’ of the

    Constitution.

d.    Recommendations
(b) Delete the words ""or that he withholds assent therefrom"".
             In other words, the power to withhold assent, conferred upon
             the Governor, by
Article 200
should be done away with;
(f) In the alternative it may be more advisable to delete
             altogether the words in
Article 200
empowering the
             Governor to reserve a Bill for the consideration of the
             President except in the case contemplated by the second
             proviso to
Article 200
and in cases where the Constitution
             requires him to do so. Such a course would not only
             strengthen the federal principle but would also do away with
             the anomalous situation, whereunder a Bill passed by the
             State Legislature can be 'killed' by the Union Council of
             Ministers by advising the President to withhold his assent
             thereto or just by cold-storaging it.”

                                                 (Emphasis supplied)
F.    INTERNATIONAL JURISPRUDENCE ON ASSENT TO BILLS
144. The position in the United Kingdom is that once a bill has passed through

      all parliamentary stages in both Houses, it is poised for the conferment of

      ‘royal assent’. Historically, the Sovereign granted assent to bills in person

      in the House of Lords, attended by the Lords Commissioners. This formal

      ceremony was known as the ‘Royal Assent ceremony’. The Royal Assent

      ceremony continued until 1967, when the British Parliament passed the

      Royal Assent Act wherein the requirement of grant of assent in person by the

      monarch was made voluntary. Although granting assent is a personal

146. The only ground on which assent may be withheld, that too solely on

     ministerial advice, is if the bill has failed to comply with mandatory

     procedural requirements or if there has been a change in government

     between the bill’s approval and its presentation for assent. Section 4 of the

     Judicial Committee Act, 1833 provides that the Sovereign may refer a bill to

     the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council for an advisory opinion on

     whether such bill contravenes a fundamental constitutional principle.

     However, the position in the UK does not clarify whether the Sovereign can

     initiate such a referral independently.

b.    Canada
147. Canada’s Royal Assent ceremony traces its origins to the United Kingdom.

148. Section 3 of the Royal Assent Act, 2002 (Can) provides that assent may be

     given ‘in Parliament assembled’ or through a written declaration, provided
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                     Page 131 of 414
it is witnessed by more than one member from each House.
The Act
stipulates that the Royal Assent must be given in the Senate Chamber at least

    twice a year and for the first appropriation bill of each session of the

    Parliament. In all other cases, such assent may be granted by the Governor

    General or her Deputy by written consent. At the provincial level, assent is

    given by the Lieutenant Governor, who is appointed by the Governor

    General. As per Section 57 of the Constitution Act, 1867, when bills are

    reserved for Queen’s pleasure, she acts upon ministerial advice rather than

    the advice of the Houses.

152. The Constitution of the United States, more particularly, Article I,
Section

     7
, Clause 2 thereof states that once a bill has been passed by the House of

     Representatives and the Senate, it must be presented to the President. If the

     President approves, he may sign the bill; otherwise, he may return it with his

     objections for reconsideration. If, after reconsideration, two-thirds of both

     the Houses passes the bill, it becomes law. Further, if the President does not

     sign a bill within ten days of presenting the same, while Congress is in

     session, the bill automatically becomes law. Therefore, in this limited

     circumstance, the concept of pocket veto is not available to the President.

     However, if Congress adjourns while the bill is awaiting assent and the

     President does not sign the bill within ten days, the bill does not become law.
d.    New Zealand
153. The colonial legislative framework of New Zealand under the
Constitution

     Act, 1852
, vested structured discretion in provincial authorities while

     maintaining the supremacy of the Crown.
Section 27
of the Constitution Act,

     1852 stipulated that every bill passed by the Provincial Council must be

     presented to the Superintendent who was an elected head of each Provincial

     Council, for the assent of the Governor who was the representative of the

     monarch. The Superintendent, in his discretion, could have either granted

     assent on behalf of the Governor or withheld assent or reserved the bill for

     the Governor’s pleasure. For a bill to become law, Superintendent had to

signify Governor’s assent. Further, her Majesty, with the advice of her Privy

     Council could issue instructions to the Governor to guide him in exercise of

     his powers to assent to, dissent from, or reserve bills for her Majesty’s

     pleasure. The Governor was required to act in obedience to these

     instructions.

e.    Australia
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 136 of 414
155. The structure of governance in Australia reflects a nuanced distribution of

        the Queen’s powers through her representatives at both national and state

        levels. The Queen of Australia is the formal Head of State. At the national

        level, the Queen’s powers and functions qua the Government of Australia

        are exercised by the Governor-General of Australia. At the State level, her

        powers are exercised by the Governor of the State. As per Section 2(1) of

        the Constitution Act, 1889, the legislative powers were vested in the

        Sovereign and exercised by her colonial Governors, subject to the advice of

        legislators. At the national level, Governor-General is not given ministerial

        advice on assent, the Presiding Officer of the House requests for assent and

        the Attorney General provides a certificate to the Governor-General

        regarding whether the bill needs to be reserved for the Queen’s assent or

        regarding any corrections.9

f.    Ireland
157. Ireland’s constitutional order provides a unique provision enabling the

     President to refer bills to the Supreme Court for its view on the

     constitutionality of the bills.
Article 26
of the Constitution of the Ireland

     confers a power on the President, who, after consultation with the Council

     of State, may refer any bill to the Supreme Court for a decision on whether

     any provisions of the bill are repugnant to the Constitution. Such reference

     must be within seven days from the presentation of the bill to the President.

     If the Supreme Court holds that any provision of the bill is repugnant to the

     Constitution, the President declines to sign such bill.
g.    Republic of Singapore
158. The Constitution of Singapore establishes a structured framework for the

     exercise of presidential discretion, setting clear time limits for decision-

     making while also ensuring safeguards against legislative overreach.
Article
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                     Page 138 of 414
21A
of the Constitution stipulates the general time limit for the President to

     exercise his discretionary powers. It provides that when the Constitution

     grants the President discretion in granting or refusing assent, concurrence,

     approval, or confirmation, he must signify his decision within the specified

     period after it is sought. The time period specified for granting assent ranges

     from thirty days to six weeks. However, it may be extended contingent upon

     any agreement between the President and the Cabinet.
159. Article 22H applies in cases where the bill or any provision seeks to curtail

     discretionary powers of the President. If, within thirty days, the President

     neither withholds assent nor refers the bill to the tribunal for its opinion on

     whether the bill curtails the President’s discretionary powers, then the

     President is deemed to have assented. Even when the tribunal is of the

     opinion that the bill does not curtail the discretionary powers conferred on

     the President, the President is still deemed to have assented.
160. The Constitution of Sri Lanka, more particularly, Article 154H, stipulates

     that upon the presentation of a statute enacted by the Provincial Council, the

     Governor shall either assent to it or return it for reconsideration as soon as

     possible. The Provincial Council may then pass the statute with or without

     amendments. If the statute is presented to the Governor again, he may
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 139 of 414
reserve it for reference by the President to the Supreme Court within one

     month of its second time, seeking a determination as to whether is

     inconsistent with the Constitution. If the Supreme Court holds the statute to

     be consistent, the Governor must grant assent. If it is held inconsistent, the

     Governor may withhold assent. It can be concluded that, upon the first

     presentation of a bill, the Governor has only two options: granting assent or

     returning it for reconsideration. On the second presentation, the Governor

     may only reserve the bill, referring it to the President for submission to the

     Supreme Court. He does not have the discretion to withhold assent

     independently.

i.    Republic of Kiribati
161. The constitutional framework of Kiribati is similar to the Democratic

     Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka. It provides powers to withhold assent only

     in exceptional situations. Section 66 of the Constitution of Kiribati allows

     the Beretitenti, that is the head of the state and head of the government, to

     withhold assent to a bill only if he believes the bill to be inconsistent with

     the Constitution. In such a case, the bill is returned to the Parliament for

     amendment, and if it is presented again and the Beretitenti still believes that

     the bill is inconsistent with the Constitution, he is required to refer it to the

     High Court for a declaration. If the Court declares that the bill is not
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 140 of 414
consistent with the Constitution, the Beretitenti must grant assent forthwith.
If the Court declares the bill to be inconsistent, it is sent back to Parliament.

     The Constitution of Zimbabwe under Section 131 provides a time period of

     twenty-one days to either assent to the bill or refer it for reconsideration.
j.    Republic of Fiji
162. The Constitution of Fiji, 2013 also does not vest discretionary power in the

     President. While Section 53 of the Fiji Independence Order, 1970 and

     Constitution of Fiji granted the Governor-General the power to grant assent

     or withhold assent, the Constitution of Fiji, 2013, removed any discretion on

     the part of the President. Section 48 of the Constitution stipulates that once

     a bill is passed, the Speaker must present it to the President for assent, which

     must be granted within seven days; otherwise, the bill is deemed to have

     received assent.

k.    Solomon Islands & Antigua and Barbuda
163. Both the Solomon Islands and Antigua and Barbuda have constitutional

     provisions that mandate the Governor-General to grant assent to bills passed

     by Parliament. In the Solomon Islands, Section 59(2) of the Constitution of

     the Soloman Islands provides that when a bill has been passed by the

     Parliament it shall be presented to the Governor-General who shall assent to
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 141 of 414
it forthwith on behalf of the Head of the State. Whereas Section 52(2) of the

     Constitution of Antigua and Barbuda states that when a bill is presented to

     the Governor-General for assent in accordance with this Constitution, he

     shall signify that he assents thereto.

l.    Islamic Republic of Pakistan
164. In our neighboring country,
Article 75
of the Constitution of the Islamic

     Republic of Pakistan provides that when a bill is presented to the President,

     he must either assent within ten days or return it to Parliament with a request

     for reconsideration. If the bill is passed again by a majority, whether

     amended or not, the President must grant assent within ten days, failing

     which it will be deemed to have received assent. Whereas
Article 105
stipulates that the Governor shall act in accordance with the advice of the

     Cabinet or the Chief Minister. The Governor may, however, require the

     Cabinet or the Chief Minister to reconsider the advice. Following such

     reconsideration, the Governor must act in accordance with the advice

     tendered within ten days.

m.    Federal Republic of Germany
165. The legislative process in Germany is governed by both federal and state

     constitutional provisions.
Article 76
of the Basic Law for the Federal

     Republic of Germany states that bills are to be introduced in Bundestag
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 142 of 414
(house elected by the people) by the Federal Government or by the

     Bundesrat (federal council). The provision grants the Bundesrat a period of

     six weeks to comment on bills for Federal Government bills. The Federal

     Government submits the bills, alongwith its views, to the Bundestag within

     six weeks alongwith its views.
Article 78
provides that a bill adopted by the

     Bundestag become the law if the Bundesrat consents to it. Laws enacted in

     accordance with the provisions of the Basic Law, after being countersigned,

     are certified by the Federal President. Furthermore, Section 60, Section V,

     the Constitution of Berlin stipulates that the bills shall be signed by the

     President of the House of Representatives without delay and then

     promulgated by the Governing Mayor within two weeks.
n.    Italian Republic
166. The legislative process in Italy is shaped by constitutional provisions that

     define the President’s role in the promulgation of laws and the scope of

     legislative urgency.
Article 73
of the Constitution of the Italian Republic

     mandates that laws be promulgated by the President within one month of

     their approval. However, if the Chambers (the Parliament consists of the

     Chamber of Deputies and the Senate of the Republic), by a majority vote,

     declare a bill to be urgent, it shall be promulgated within the time specified

     by the bill itself.
Article 74
empowers the President to request a new

     deliberation by means of a message stating the reasons for such a request. It
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 143 of 414
is important to take note that if the Chambers pass the bill once again, then

     the law must to be promulgated.

o.    French Republic
167. In France, the promulgation of legislation is subject to defined constitutional

     timelines.
Article 10
of the Constitution of October 4, 1958, stipulates that

     the President of the Republic must promulgate Acts of Parliament within

     fifteen days after the final passage of an Act. It also empowers the President

     to request Parliament to reopen the debate on the Act, or any specific

     sections thereof, and such a request for reopening of debate shall not be

     refused.

p.    Japan
168. As per the Japanese constitutional framework, the Diet (Parliament of Japan)

     is the sole law-making organ of the State.
Article 59
envisages that if a bill

     passed by the House of Representatives is rejected by the House of

     Councillors, it becomes a law when passed a second time by the House of

     Representatives by a two-thirds majority of the members present.
Article 74
states that all laws and cabinet orders must be signed by the competent

     Minister of State and countersigned by the Prime Minister.
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 144 of 414
169. A plain reading of
Article 200
of the Constitution indicates that when a bill

     is passed by the legislature of a State, it is mandatorily required to be placed

     before the Governor for his assent. This is because without receiving the

     assent of the President, a bill cannot become an Act. However, when a bill

     is presented to the Governor for his assent, the Governor is required to make

     a declaration from the three options available to him under the substantive

     part of
Article 200
, that is, to assent, to withhold assent, or to reserve the bill

     for the consideration of the President.

170. The first proviso prescribes a mechanism whereby the Governor may return

     a bill, which is not a Money Bill, back to the State legislature requesting

     them to reconsider the bill or certain provisions thereof or consider the

     possibility of making certain amendments to it. Once a bill is so returned by

     the Governor, the State legislature is required to take note of the suggestions

     made by the Governor and reconsider the bill accordingly. If the bill, after

     such reconsideration by the State Legislature is again passed and presented

     to the Governor, then in such circumstances as per the first proviso, the

     Governor would then be prohibited from withholding his assent to the bill.
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                          Page 145 of 414
171. The second proviso provides for a specific situation wherein the Governor

    is mandated to reserve a bill for the consideration of the President if, in his

    opinion, the bill upon becoming law, would so derogate from the powers of

    the High Court as to endanger the position which the High Court has been

    designed to fill by the Constitution.

172. One of the principal contentions advanced by the learned Attorney General

    before us was that the first proviso to
Article 200
provides an independent

    fourth course of action to the Governor besides the three other options

    available to him under the substantive part of the Article. To put it

    differently, his argument was that the Governor may either withhold assent

    to a bill simpliciter, as provided under the substantive part of
Article 200
, or

    he may invoke the procedure prescribed under the first proviso and return

    the bill back to the State legislature along with such a message as is

    mentioned in the first proviso. In other words, he contended that where the

    Governor declares a simpliciter withholding of assent, the same would be an

    absolute veto of the bill, and the State legislature would have no occasion to

    reconsider the bill in such a scenario. As a corollary the first proviso would

    have no applicability and the State legislature would not be entitled to

    reconsider the bill on its own motion.

W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                     Page 148 of 414

W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 150 of 414
21. The second proviso impacts upon the option which is
        provided by the substantive part of
Article 200
to the
        Governor to reserve a Bill for the consideration of the
        President by making it mandatory in the situation envisaged
        there. The option of reserving a Bill for the consideration of
        the President is turned into a mandate where the Governor
        has no option but to reserve it for the consideration of the
        President. The second proviso is, therefore, in the nature of
        an exception to the option which is granted to the Governor
        by the substantive part of
Article 200
to reserve any Bill for
        the consideration of the President.
22. A proviso, as is well settled, may fulfil the purpose of
        being an exception. Sometimes, however, a proviso may be in
        the form of an explanation or in addition to the substantive
        provision of a statute. The first proviso allows the Governor,
        where the Bill is not a Money Bill to send it back to the
        legislature together with a message. In terms of the message,
        the legislature may be requested by the Governor to
        reconsider the entirety of the Bill. This may happen for
        instance where the Governor believes that the entirety of the
        Bill suffers from an infirmity. Alternatively, the Governor
        may request the legislature to reconsider any specific
        provision of the Bill. While returning the Bill, the Governor
        may express the desirability of introducing an amendment in
        the Bill. The desirability of an amendment may arise with a
        view to cure an infirmity or deficiency in the Bill. The
        concluding part of the first proviso however stipulates that if
        the Bill is passed again by the legislature either with or
        without amendments, the Governor shall not withhold assent
        therefrom upon presentation. The concluding phrase “shall
        not withhold assent therefrom” is a clear indicator that the
        exercise of the power under the first proviso is relatable to
        the withholding of the assent by the Governor to the Bill in
        the first instance. That is why in the concluding part, the first
        proviso indicates that upon the passing of the Bill by the
        legislature either with or without amendments, the Governor
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 154 of 414
shall not withhold assent. The role which is ascribed by the
        first proviso to the Governor is recommendatory in nature
        and it does not bind the State Legislature.
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 155 of 414
25. The Governor, as an unelected Head of the State, is
        entrusted with certain constitutional powers. However, this
        power cannot be used to thwart the normal course of law-
        making by the State Legislatures. Consequently, if the
        Governor decides to withhold assent under the substantive
        part of
Article 200
, the logical course of action is to pursue
        the course indicated in the first proviso of remitting the Bill
        to the State Legislature for reconsideration. In other words,
        the power to withhold assent under the substantive part of
Article 200
must be read together with the consequential
        course of action to be adopted by the Governor under the first
        proviso. If the first proviso is not read in juxtaposition to the
        power to withhold assent conferred by the substantive part of
Article 200
, the Governor as the unelected Head of State
        would be in a position to virtually veto the functioning of the
        legislative domain by a duly elected legislature by simply
        declaring that assent is withheld without any further
        recourse. Such a course of action would be contrary to
        fundamental principles of a constitutional democracy based
        on a Parliamentary pattern of governance. Therefore, when
        the Governor decides to withhold assent under the
        substantive part of
Article 200
, the course of action which is
        to be followed is that which is indicated in the first proviso.
        The Governor is under
Article 168
a part of the legislature
        and is bound by the constitutional regime.


186. A close reading of the first proviso reveals that the action of returning the

     bill to the State legislature by the Governor is qualified by the expression

     “as soon as possible”. However, once the bill has been returned to the State

     legislature by the Governor, there is no such expediency required on part of

     the State legislature in reconsidering the bill. Further, once the bill is

     reconsidered and passed again by the State legislature, there is again a

     mandate on the Governor not to withhold assent to such a bill. The only

     obligation upon the State legislature is to mandatorily take into consideration

     the suggestions contained in the message sent by the Governor along with

     the bill. However, the State Legislature is not under an obligation to
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 158 of 414
mandatorily introduce any amendments suggested by the Governor and it

     may proceed to repass the bill without any amendments.
187. Since there is no obligation on the State legislature to repass the bill returned

     by the Governor under the first proviso, the expression “falls-through” can

     only refer to those situations where the State legislature elects not to pass

     the bill for reconsideration again, and in such circumstances causing the bill

     to lapse. There is nothing in the first proviso which gives the Governor the

     discretion to initiate the procedural machinery described therein. Therefore,

     the first proviso, cannot be treated as an independent course of action

     severable from the option of withholding of assent. The use of the expression

     “as soon as possible” in the first proviso makes it clear that the Constitution

     has imposed a sense of urgency upon the Governor and expects him to act

     with expediency if he decides to declare the withholding of assent. At the

     same time, that the use of the expression “may” in the first proviso, as

     explained in
State of Punjab
(supra) does not confer a discretion upon the

     Governor to decide whether to act in accordance with the procedure

     prescribed in the first proviso. On the contrary, it only denotes that the first

     proviso would be applicable only when the option of withholding of assent

     is exercised. In other words, the expression “may” is used keeping in mind

     that there are three options that the Governor may choose from when a bill

     is presented to him for assent.
Therefore, there is no requirement for
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 159 of 414
construing the expression “may” as “shall” as was vehemently urged on

     behalf of the petitioner, and the interpretation provided in
State of Punjab
(supra) and further explained by us does not merit construing the use of

     “may” as “shall”, as it would result in a logical absurdity insofar as it would

     make the compliance with the procedure
laid down in
the first proviso

     mandatory in the exercise of all three options available to the Governor

     under the substantive part of
Article 200
of the Constitution.
188. It is also remarkable to take note of the expression “if the bill is passed

     again” which signifies that the ultimate discretion to decide whether the

     State legislature wants to repass the bill or not continues to remain the

     prerogative of the State legislature alone. Similarly, the use of the expression

     “with or without amendment” denotes that even if the State legislature

     decides to reconsider the bill, the discretion to repass it with or without the

     amendments suggested by the Governor again continues to be their sole

     prerogative. In order to obviate any further confusion, we deem it

     appropriate to clarify that the use of the expression “shall reconsider the bill

     accordingly” does not indicate that it is obligatory for the State legislature

     to take up the bill for reconsideration. The word “shall” used in this

     expression must be read in conjunction with the word “accordingly”. The

     use of “shall” in this context is only for the limited purpose that if the State

     legislature in its discretion does decide to not allow the bill to “fall through”
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 160 of 414
by taking it up for reconsideration, then the scope of such reconsideration

     must at the very least encompass the suggestions communicated by the

     Governor in his message. The word “shall” used herein cannot be singled

     out and construed devoid of its context.

189. The structure of
Article 200
is also helpful in discerning the meaning of the

     content that it holds. There is a substantive part of the provision and there

     are two provisos to the substantive part. In the substantive part, there are

     three options for the Governor to choose from, each separated by the

     conjunction “or” thereby indicating the mutual exclusivity of the three

     options. If the Governor opts for the first option and grants assent to the bill

     presented to him, the first proviso doesn’t come into consideration.

     Similarly, if the Governor chooses the third option and reserves the bill for

     the consideration of the President, there is no occasion for the operation of

     first proviso. The second proviso is overarching in nature and provides that

     in the situation as described therein, the Governor can only exercise one

     option, that is, reserve the bill for the consideration of the President.
190. The use of the expression “shall declare” in the substantive part of
Article

     200
indicates that the Governor is required to make a declaration from the

     three choices provided to him under the substantive part and there cannot be

     any fourth course of action. As soon as assent is granted, the bill becomes
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 161 of 414
an Act and there is no scope thereafter for reservation for the consideration

    of the President or returning back to the State legislature. If reservation for

    the consideration of the President is declared then thereafter no returning of

    the bill to the State legislature can take place, unless the President so directs

    under the proviso to
Article 201.
Thus, it is only upon the declaration of

    withholding of assent that the first proviso is animates into action.
194. There is one another way of looking at
Article 200.
The procedure, as

    prescribed under the scheme of the provision, involves and envisages the

    actual motion of a bill from one constitutional authority to another. The

    Article starts with the requirement of the bill having to be mandatorily

    presented to the Governor after it has been passed by the State legislature.

    Thereafter, there is an obligation on the Governor to make a choice from one

    of the three options provided in the substantive part of the Article and also

    declare such a decision. Here, if assent is declared, then the bill becomes an
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 164 of 414
Act and the Government may thereafter take steps to notify the same in the

official Gazette. If the Governor declares that bill is being reserved for

consideration of the President as per the second proviso or otherwise, then

the bill travels from the Governor to the President, whereupon
Article 201
comes into play. The mechanism provided in the first proviso also envisages

the movement of the bill from the Governor to the State legislature and then

back to the Governor upon being passed again. The expression “as soon as

possible” appearing in the first proviso infuses a sense of urgency and

expediency in the mechanism of returning of bills by the Governor. It goes

without saying that the scheme of
Article 200
is characterized by the

movement of the bill from one constitutional authority to another and that

too with a sense of expediency. It is trite to say that
Article 200
occupies an

important role of giving the bills passed by the State legislature the authority

of an Act. Without the procedure envisaged under
Article 200
, the bills

remain mere pieces of paper, skeletons without any flesh or lifeblood

flowing through their veins, mere documentation of the aspirations of the

people without any possibility of bringing them to fruition. The only way by

which the option of withholding of assent provided in the substantive part

of
Article 200
can be reconciled with the scheme permeating the remainder

of the provision is by reading it in conjunction with the first proviso. It is

only when the withholding of assent is tempered with the requirement of

following the procedure prescribed in the first proviso that the constitutional
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 165 of 414
object of ensuring that the law-making machinery at the State level keeps on

     running unhindered can be fulfilled.
196. Thus, in light of the aforesaid discussion, it becomes clear that there are only

     three courses of action available to the Governor to choose from when a bill

     is presented to him for assent under
Article 200.
The first proviso is not an

     independent fourth course of action but intrinsically attached to the option

     of withholding of assent. In other words, the first proviso is clarificatory and

     only elaborates the procedure to be followed in case the option of

     withholding of assent is invoked by the Governor.
197. The use of the expression “shall” in the substantive part of
Article 200
read

     with the expression “as soon as possible” used in the first proviso indicates

     that there is no pocket veto available to the Governor while he is exercising

     the powers under
Article 200.
As we have also discussed in the subsequent
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 166 of 414
parts of this judgment, inaction on part of the Governor to take a decision

    when a bill is presented to him under
Article 200
is grossly violative of the

    constitutional scheme of expediency which permeates the provision.
200. We have also discussed in line with the decision in
State of Punjab
(supra)

      that the option of withholding of assent is attached with the first proviso and

      once the Governor declares the withholding of assent, the entire mechanism

      which is
laid down in
the first proviso itself has to follow suit. Thus, the first

      proviso to
Article 200
is a complete code in itself as regards the procedure

      which is to be followed once the Governor withholds assent and the rest of

      the article has no applicability thereafter.
201. It is also interesting to note that the expression “withhold assent” has been

     employed in the substantive part of
Article 200.
The literal meaning of the

     expression ‘withhold’ as defined in a number of dictionaries is to keep back;

     to keep in one’s possession what belongs to or is due to others; to hinder; to

     prevent; to defer; to postpone; to detain; to keep under control; to retain; to

     keep from doing something; to refrain from doing something. Thus, it would

     not be incorrect to construe that the option of withholding of assent has been

     provided to the Governor under the substantive part only with a view to defer

     or to postpone the grant of assent to a bill. Withholding of assent cannot be

     construed to be the same as denying of assent or as conferring a power in

     the Governor to veto a legislation passed by the State legislature, which

     would be against the very fundamentals of a representative democracy.
202. Further, the scope of this deferment of assent by the Governor has been made

     subject to the procedure
laid down in
the first proviso. The procedure
laid

     down in
the first proviso ensures that the withholding of assent does not

     become analogous to a pocket veto. The use of the expression “if the Bill is

     passed again by the House or Houses with or without amendment” in the

     first proviso clearly indicates that the role of the Governor under the first

     proviso has been characterized as recommendatory in nature and that his

     suggestions do not bind the legislature. Further, the expression “the
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 169 of 414
Governor shall not withhold assent therefrom” in the first proviso leaves no

    scope for the Governor to take any course of action other than discontinuing

    the withholding of assent, which by necessary implication means to accord

    assent to the bill. The expression also indicates that there is strict

    constitutional prohibition against the Governor to not withhold assent to the

    bill.
203. What follows from the aforesaid discussion is that once the option of

    withholding of assent is exercised by the Governor, the mechanism under

    the first proviso is set into motion to the exclusion of everything else

    envisaged under the article. This is in view of the maxim Expressio Unius

    Est Exclusio Alterius i.e., the expression of one thing is the exclusion of

    another. Once the mechanism under the first proviso is set into motion and

    the various stages are complied with, the only possible manner in which the

    mechanism prescribed under the first proviso can conclude is by the

    Governor granting assent to the bill. Thus, there is no scope for the Governor

    to reserve a bill for the consideration of the President once it is presented to

    him for reconsideration after compliance with the procedure
laid down in
the first proviso.
206. We say so because the procedure
laid down in
the first proviso cannot be

     construed as giving the State legislature the unfettered power to introduce

     changes to the bill which alter its very nature, or which, for instance, fall

     foul of the second proviso to
Article 200.
In such a scenario, the Governor

     would have all the three options which are available to him when a bill is

     presented to him in the first instance. However, whenever the House or

     Houses reconsider the bill “accordingly”, that is, in accordance with the

     suggestions of the Governor and pass it with or without amendments, the

     Governor is bound to act as per the clear constitutional directive
laid down

     in
the first proviso.
213. The petitioner also placed reliance on the recommendations made by the

     Sarkaria Commission and the Punchhi Commission to argue that the Court

     should read in some time-limit into the scheme of Article(s) 200 and
201
respectively to prevent inaction on the part of the Governor and the

     President.
216. However, unlike many countries across the globe wherein a provision for

    deemed assent upon the expiry of the specified time period has been made,

    there is no such provision in our Constitution. The only manner in which a

    temporal imperative has been weaved into the scheme of
Article 200
is by

    the use of the expression “as soon as possible” in the first proviso. The said

    expression, which also appears in
Article 111
of the Constitution, was the

    subject of some debate in the Constituent Assembly.
217.
Article 111
, which provides for the President’s assent to bills passed by

    Parliament was originally numbered as
Article 91
under the Draft

    Constitution and it provided a time-limit of six-weeks to the President to

    send back the bill to the House(s) for reconsideration. The Draft article read

    as follows:
218. During the Constituent Assembly debates, Dr. B.R. Ambedkar moved an

    amendment to substitute the expression “not later than six weeks” with “as

    soon as possible”. Further in the debate, Shri Naziruddin Ahmad advocated

    for a change in the aforesaid amendment and sought to substitute the term

    “as soon as possible” with “as soon as may be”. His contention rested on

    the reasoning that the phrase, “as soon as possible” which was introduced

    by Dr. Ambedkar in his amendment in place of the original wording used in
Article 91
, that is, “not later than six weeks”, imposed an unduly stringent
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 177 of 414
obligation upon the President. He was of the opinion that “as soon as

        possible” mandates immediate action, thereby curtailing the President’s

        scope to engage in a careful and deliberate review of the bill presented for

        assent. He expressed concern that such a rigid constraint could give rise to

        hasty decisions, devoid of any careful examination of the presented bill. In

        his view, the formulation ran the risk of undermining the quality of the

        President’s judgment under
Article 111.
He expressed his opinion as

        follows:
219. To avoid the aforesaid possibilities, Shri Naziruddin Ahmad proposed the

        adoption of “as soon as may be”, which he interpreted to mean “as soon as

        is reasonably practicable”. In his opinion, this change would allow the

        President greater flexibility and sufficient time to thoroughly examine the

        provisions of the bill presented to him. Such freedom would prove

        particularly valuable when the President contemplates returning the bill to

W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 178 of 414
the House(s) for reconsideration, especially in circumstances where

    amendments might be recommended. The essence of Shri Ahmad’s

    amendment was to safeguard the President’s ability to render well-reasoned

    and thoughtful decisions without any rigid time constraints.
222. In light of the debate which took place on 20 th May 1949, the proposed

        amendment to
Article 91
was adopted by the Assembly, thereby substituting

        the expression “not later than six weeks” with “as soon as possible” and the

        same came to be added to the Constitution.
8, CONSTITUENT ASSEMB. DEB. (May 20, 1949) 195.
91. This adoption and amendment of draft
Article 91
reflects a sense of

     inherent trust reposed by the Constituent Assembly that the President would

     execute his functions as enshrined under
Article 111
of the Constitution in a

     timely and efficient manner.

up to the personal freedom of an individual. Sub-articles (1)
        and (2) refer to the protection against arrest and detention of
        a person under the ordinary law. Persons arrested or
        detained under a law providing for preventive detention are
        dealt with in sub-articles (4) to (7). Sub-article (5) says that
        when a person is detained in pursuance of an order under a
        law providing for preventive detention the grounds on which
        the order is made have to be communicated to the person
        concerned as soon as may be and he has to be afforded
        earliest opportunity to represent against the order. The
        object of communicating the grounds is to enable the detenu
        to make his representation against the order. The words “as
        soon as may be” in the context must imply anxious care on
        the part of the authority concerned to perform its duty in this
        respect as early as practicable without avoidable delay.
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 184 of 414
Similarly, when the representation is made it is in the fitness
            of things that the said representation should be considered
            with the same sense of urgency with which the grounds are
            intended to be communicated to the detenu. That is the only
            way in which the purpose, for which the earliest
            communication of the grounds to the person concerned is
            provided, can be achieved. The representation must,
            therefore, be considered with due promptitude or expedition
            and without avoidable delay, in other words with reasonable
            dispatch. As held by this Court in Jayanarayan case, the
            representation should be considered as expeditiously as
            possible. As the question of delay in considering the
            representation falls for determination on the facts and
            circumstances of each case the binding force of a past
            precedent for a later case would largely depend on the degree
            of close similarity of the circumstances dealt with therein.

under the Tenth Schedule is not defeated. The relevant observations

          read as under:
Wherever the Constitution requires the
                 satisfaction of the President or the Governor
                 for the exercise of any power or function by the
                 President or the Governor, as the case may be,
                 as for example in
Articles 123
, 213
, 311(2)
proviso (c), 317, 352(1), 356 and 360, the
                 satisfaction required by the Constitution is not
                 the personal satisfaction of the President or of
                 the Governor but is the satisfaction of the
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 193 of 414
President or of the Governor in the
                 constitutional sense under the Cabinet system
                 of Government. It is the satisfaction of the
                 Council of Ministers on whose aid and advice
                 the President or the Governor generally
                 exercises all his powers and functions.
21. Even though the Governor may be
                 authorised to exercise some functions, under
                 different provisions of the Constitution, the
                 same are required to be exercised only on the
                 basis of the aid and advice tendered to him
                 under
Article 163
, unless the Governor has
                 been expressly authorised, by or under a
                 constitutional provision, to discharge the
                 function concerned, in his own discretion.”
(ii)   Secondly, it observed that the law is clear and explicit – the advice

       of the State Cabinet is binding on the Governor when it comes to the

       exercise of powers under
Article 161.
In the absence of any other

       provision under the Constitution or any statute in this regard, the

       Governor could not have deviated from the binding recommendations

       of the State Cabinet and referred the mercy petition to the President.

       It was held that such an action is contrary to the constitutional scheme.

       The relevant observations read as under:
exercise of these powers, such as, under
Article 161
is one such

        ground for the exercise of judicial review as the said provision

        pertains to the liberty of individuals and any inexplicable delay not on
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 195 of 414
account of the prisoners, is inexcusable. The relevant observations

      read as under:
On the contrary, it only reinforces the sense of expediency and urgency that

     has been time and again emphasized since the adoption of the Constitution.

     The reason why the prescription of a time-limit does not tantamount to an

     alteration or amendment is because the time-limit that is being prescribed by

     cannot be understood to be a hanging sword on the Governor whereby even

     an unavoidable non-compliance would automatically ensue consequences of

     ‘assent’. The nature of such prescription is quite different which may be

     better explained through the concept of judicial review.
239. Any time-limit in the exercise of powers in terms of
Article 200
of the

    Constitution should not be construed as timelines laid within the edifice of

    the provision, rather should be understood as timelines that would serve as

    a lodestar for the purpose of exercise of judicial review by the courts, a

    benchmark tool to aid and enable the courts in ascertaining if any inaction

    or malfeasance has occasioned in the exercise of such powers. These

    timelines no doubt demand the earnest adherence by the Governor, however,

    these being nothing more than tools upon which scrutiny by judicial review

    is to be premised, remain as prescriptions within the realm of judicial review

    alone and do not transgress into the legislative bounds or amount to

    alteration of the text or authority of
Article 200
of the Constitution. The

    reason why these time-lines do not immolate the very fabric of
Article 200
is because the said provision even with the infusion of these time-limit still
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 205 of 414
remains markedly different from its counterpart provisions where such time-
limits are legislatively prescribed. For instance,
Article 75
of the

     Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan or Article I,
Section 7
of

     the U.S. Constitution, where if no decision is taken within the stipulated

     time-limit by the President then the bills are deemed to have been assented

     to.
240. Thus, it is important to take note of this very fine but pertinent distinction

     that the prescription of a time-limit by this Court into
Article 200
of the

     Constitution does not fundamentally change the procedure which has been

     envisaged. While the reading in of a time-limit under
Article 200
would have

     meant that there would be deemed assent upon failure of the Governor to

     comply with the said timeline, the prescription of a reasonable time period

     does not introduce any such mechanism or deeming fiction in
Article 200.
244. While the reading in of an absolute time-limit would have left the Governor

     with no choice but to comply with it, the prescription of the judicially

     evolved time-limits by us leaves it open for the Governor to justify the delay

     caused by providing reasonable grounds. Delay caused by the Governor

     beyond the prescribed time-limits would be justiciable and the courts, with

     deference to applicable judicial principles, would be fully competent to
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 207 of 414
ascertain whether the delayed exercise of power by the Governor under
Article 200
was based on any reasonable grounds or not.
251. Failure to comply with the timelines prescribed above would make the

      inaction on part of the Governor amenable to judicial review. We shall also

      deal with the necessity of expeditiously disposing of the references under
Article 201
by the President in subsequent parts of this judgment.



iv.    Whether the Governor in the exercise of his powers under
Article 200
of the Constitution can only act in accordance with the aid and advice
       tendered to him by the State Council of Ministers?
252. Significant time was spent during the course of the arguments on the key

      issue of the scope of discretion enjoyed by the Governor in exercise of his

      powers under
Article 200
, more particularly, as regards the reservation of

      bills for the consideration of the President.
Chelmsford Reforms of 1919, which culminated into the GoI Act, 1919,

     marked the early stirrings of responsible government, albeit in a nascent

     form. Despite this shift, the Governor remained central to the provincial

     administration,     continuing      to     wield     significant     authority.
261. The declaration      of Independence brought        about    a fundamental

     transformation in the role of the Governor. Until the Constitution came into

     effect, the provisions of the GoI Act, 1935, as modified by the India

     (Provisional Constitution) Order, 1947 (for short, the “Adaptation Order”),

     governed the administration of the country. Significantly, the Adaptation

     Order omitted the expressions ‘in his discretion’, ‘acting in his discretion’,

     and ‘exercising his individual judgment’ from the Act, signaling a departure

     from the colonial framework.

elaborated on the potential tussle that would ensue between an elected

        Governor and the Chief Minister of the State as follows:
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                             Page 224 of 414
between an elected Governor and the Chief Minister or Premier, which could

        disrupt governance. Apart from the very real possibility of conflicts between

        the elected Governor and the Chief Minister which necessitated appointment

        via nomination, he argued, on the other hand that, if there was no conflict

        and there was perfect agreement or collusion between the Governor and the

        Chief Minister, they could agree in defying the Centre altogether and that

        would put the Centre in a precarious position where they would be

        completely blocked out from the States. Therefore, he remarked that, “But

        apart from the conflict, if there is no conflict and there is perfect agreement,

        if these two gentlemen set the Centre at naught, what will be the position?”18.

        Hence, in his opinion, the appointment of Governors by the President would

        maintain a balance of power and ensure some degree of Central influence

        over provincial matters. He further suggested that Governors should serve

        at the pleasure of the President, thereby eliminating the need for

        impeachment provisions and also reinforcing the oversight of the Centre.
270. Shri. Hriday Nath Kunzru highlighted the potential for friction between

        Governors and their Cabinets, specifically with reference to
Article 175
of

        the Draft Constitution, which has now been adopted as
Article 200.
By

        drawing comparisons to the Canadian model, he argued that empowering

c.    Constituent Assembly Debates on the Exercise of Discretion by the

272. The other key question which fell for the consideration of the Constituent

     Assembly was whether any discretion would be made available to the

     Governor as the constitutional head of the State.
Article 163(1)
of the

     Constitution, which describes the nature of such discretionary powers, reads

     as follows:
273. To understand the true import and the scope of this discretion which exists

     with the Governor, it would be apposite for us to look into the Constituent

     Assembly debates pertaining to this Article in some detail.

     amendments were sought to be moved to draft
Article 143
on the 1st of July

     1949; however, those did not gain the approval of the Constituent Assembly
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 227 of 414
and the original version of draft
Article 143
came to be later adopted as
Article 163
as we see it today.
274. Of the two amendments, one of which was moved by Shri. H.V. Kamath

        sought to delete the expression, “except in so far as he is by or under this

        Constitution required to exercise his functions or any of them in his

        discretion”. Shri. H.V. Kamath was of the opinion that the draft Article had

        been blindly copied from the GoI Act, 1935, without any mature

        consideration. He further remarked that, “There is no strong or valid reason

        for giving the Governor more authority either in his discretion or otherwise

        vis-a-vis his ministers, than has been given to the President in relation to his

        ministers”20. Investing such wide discretionary powers on the Governor was

        all the more problematic, according to him, since Governors are nominated

        to their positions and not elected. No departure from the principles of a

        constitutional government must be favored except for reasons of emergency

        and therefore, he advocated for these discretionary powers to be done away

        with.
276. As an illustration, Shri. T.T. Krishnamachari referred to draft
Article 188
which related to the proclamation of Emergency in States by the Governor

        under his discretion. It was his opinion that if such a discretionary power can

        be given under draft
Article 188
, there is no harm in the mention of

        discretion under draft
Article 143
either. He understood the scheme of the

        draft Constitution to mean that unless there is a specific mention of

discretion under any subsequent Article, the discretionary power mentioned

        under draft
Article 143
cannot at all be exercised.
279. Shri. B.M. Gupta was of the view that if certain powers had to be given to

    the Governor, our endeavor must be to restrict them as far as possible so that

    the Governor’s position as a constitutional head may be maintained.
284. While concluding the debate on draft
Article 143
, Dr. B. R. Ambedkar

        elaborated that the main and crucial question under this draft Article was

        whether the Governor must have certain discretionary powers or not. During

        the course of the debate, it was pointed out that the retention of discretionary

        powers in the Governor was contrary to responsible government in the

        States/provinces. It was also stated that the same mimicked the GoI Act,

        1935, which was largely assailed as being undemocratic. However, Dr. B.

        R. Ambedkar was of the undoubted view that “the retention in or the vesting

the Governor with certain discretionary powers is in no sense contrary to or

        in no sense a negation of responsible government.”27 He cited Section 55 of

        the Canadian Constitution which read as follows:
286. Now moving on to how an Article providing for a certain amount of

    discretionary powers to the Governor is to be framed, Dr. B. R. Ambedkar

    elaborated that there are several ways in which the same can be done. One

    way could be to omit the words from draft
Article 143
and to add to draft
Articles 175 (presently
Article 200
)
, 188
, or such other provisions, an

    express mention which vests the Governor with discretionary power. Those

    Articles would then mention that notwithstanding draft
Article 143
, the

    Governor would have a certain discretionary power. Another way would be

    to state in draft
Article 143
itself that “except as provided in draft
Articles

    175
, 188
etc.”, the Governor shall act in accordance with the aid and advice

    of the Council of Ministers with the Chief Minister at the head. However,

    irrespective of what method of drafting is adopted, the essential point that

    would remain is that the Governor’s discretionary power must be

    acknowledged in some form.
288. While acknowledging that there exists a material difference between draft
Article 61(1) (Article 74
(1) as it stands today) relating to the executive

    functions of the President vis-à-vis his Ministers and the draft
Article 143
,

    Dr. B. R. Ambedkar elucidated that it was not the intention of the drafters to

    vest any discretionary power upon the President. It is because the provincial

    governments are required to work in subordination to the Central

    government and in order to ensure that they do act in such subordination, the

    Governor would reserve certain matters, thereby giving the President an

    opportunity to see that they are broadly in compliance with the policy of the

    Central government. Through this mechanism, the President would be able
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 238 of 414
to ensure that the rules under which the provincial governments are

    supposed to act, according to the Constitution, are observed. Therefore, the

    vesting of discretionary powers in the post of the Governor was considered

    crucial to enable this administrative dialogue between the Centre and the

    provinces.
The founding fathers deliberately avoided election to the
        office of the Governor, as is in vogue in the USA to insulate
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 241 of 414
the office from linguistic chauvinism. The President has been
        empowered to appoint him as executive head of the State
        under
Article 155
in Part VI, Chapter II. The executive power
        of the State is vested in him by
Article 154
and exercised by
        him with the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers, the
        Chief Minister as its head. Under
Article 159
the Governor
        shall discharge his functions in accordance with the oath to
        protect and defend the Constitution and the law. The office of
        the Governor, therefore, is intended to ensure protection and
        sustenance of the constitutional process of the working of the
        Constitution by the elected executive and giving him an
        umpire's role. When a Gandhian economist member of the
        Constituent Assembly wrote a letter to Gandhiji of his plea
        for abolition of the office of the Governor, Gandhiji wrote to
        him for its retention; thus, the Governor had been given a
        very useful and necessary place in the scheme of the team. He
        would be an arbiter when there was a constitutional deadlock
        in the State and he would be able to play an impartial role.
        There would be administrative mechanism through which the
        constitutional crisis would be resolved in the State. The
        Governor thus should play an important role. In his dual
        undivided capacity as head of the State he should impartially
        assist the President. As a constitutional head of the State
        Government in times of constitutional crisis he should bring
        about sobriety. The link is apparent when we find that
Article
        356
would be put into operation normally based on the
        Governor's report. He should truthfully and with high degree
        of constitutional responsibility, in terms of his oath, inform
        the President that a situation has arisen in which the
        constitutional machinery in the State has failed and the
        Government of the State cannot be carried on in accordance
        with the provisions of the Constitution, with necessary
        detailed factual foundation.”
                                           (Emphasis supplied)
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                     Page 242 of 414
To illustrate,
Article 239(2)
states that where a Governor is
        appointed an administrator of an adjoining Union territory
        he shall exercise his functions as such administrator
        independently of his Council of Ministers. The other articles
        which speak of the discretion of the Governor are paragraphs
        9(2) and 18(3) of the Sixth Schedule and
Articles 371-A(1)(b)
,
        371-A(1)(d)
and
371-A(2)(b)
and
371-A(2)(f).
The discretion
        conferred on the Governor means that as the constitutional
        or formal head of the State the power is vested in him. In this
        connection, reference may be made to
Article 356
which
        states that the Governor can send a report to the President
        that a situation has arisen in which the government of the
        State cannot be carried on in accordance with the provisions
        of this Constitution. Again
Article 200
requires the Governor
        to reserve for consideration any Bill which in his opinion if it
        became law, would so derogate from the powers of the High
        Court as to endanger the position which the High Court is
        designed to fill under the Constitution.
controlled by the Union Ministry which is answerable to
        Parliament for those actions. Again, a minimal area
        centering round reports to be despatched under
Article 356
may not, in the nature of things, be amenable to Ministerial
        advice. The practice of sending periodical reports to the
        Union Government is a pre-constitutional one and it is
        doubtful if a Governor could or should report behind the back
        of his Ministers. For a Centrally appointed constitutional
        functionary to keep a dossier on his Ministers or to report
        against them or to take up public stances critical of
        Government policy settled by the Cabinet or to interfere in
        the administration directly — these are unconstitutional faux
        pas and run counter to Parliamentary system. In all his
        constitutional ‘functions’ it is the Ministers who act; only in
        the narrow area specifically marked out for discretionary
        exercise by the Constitution, he is untramelled by the State
        Ministers' acts and advice. Of course, a limited free-wheeling
        is available regarding choice of Chief Minister and dismissal
        of the Ministry, as in the English practice adapted to Indian
        conditions.
constitutional authority. This position is not acceptable
        because an examination of the executive and legislative
        functions of the Governor, from the surrounding provisions
        of the Constitution clearly brings out that the Governor has
        not been assigned any significant role either in the executive
        or the legislative functioning of the State. The position
        adopted on behalf of the appellants, on the other hand,
        augurs well in an overall harmonious construction of the
        provisions of the Constitution. Even on a cursory
        examination of the relevant provisions of the Constitution, we
        are inclined to accept the contention advanced on behalf of
        the appellants.
Significantly, with reference to the Governor's discretionary
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 258 of 414
powers, it was emphasised by Dr B.R. Ambedkar, that: (CAD
        Vol. 8, p. 501)

             “The Hon'ble Dr B.R. Ambedkar.— … The clause
             is a very limited clause; it says: ‘except insofar as
             he is by or under this Constitution’. Therefore,
Article 163
will have to be read in conjunction with
             such other articles which specifically reserve the
             power to the Governor. It is not a general clause
             giving the Governor power to disregard the advice
             of his Ministers, in any matter in which he finds he
             ought to disregard. There, I think, lies the fallacy
             of the argument of my Hon'ble friend ….”

        In our considered view, the Constituent Assembly Debates
        leave no room for any doubt that the Framers of the
        Constitution desired to embody the general and basic
        principle, describing the extent and scope of the discretionary
        power of the Governor, in clause (1) of
Article 163
, and not
        in clause (2) thereof, as suggested by the learned counsel for
        the respondents.
308. However, once the bill is passed by the State legislature, and presented to

     the Governor for assent, he must act on the aid and advice of the Council of

     Ministers as a general rule and only in exceptional situations which have

     been illustrated in paragraph 300 of this judgment, should he reserve it for

     the consideration of the President. A look at Rule 48 of the Tamil Nadu

     Government Business Rules, 1978 makes it clear that once a draft bill is

     approved by the Minister-in-Charge, a copy of it is supplied to the Governor.

     Rule 48 reads thus:
309. After circulation of the bill to the Governor, any suggestions made by the

     Governor may be looked into and incorporated. Thereafter, a final copy of

     the bill as approved by the Law Department is also circulated to the

     Governor. Rule 51(b) which provides for it reads thus:
312. What also needs to be remembered is that whenever a provision of the

    Constitution prescribes for the assent of the President for the purpose of

    enforceability or securing immunity, any State government would, in all

    likelihood, advice the Governor to reserve the bill for the consideration of

    the President. Even the Tamil Nadu Government Business Rules, 1978

    prescribe the procedure for pre-consultation with the Central government

    whenever a subject-matter falling in the Concurrent list or certain other

    constitutional provision, is being legislated upon. As we have also discussed,

    the position settled by Kaiser-I-Hind (supra) is that the reference to the

    President needs to be detailed and specific so as to enable him to undertake

    an effective “consideration” of the reserved bill. In the practical working of

    a Cabinet form of government, it is the Council of Ministers who would be

    best equipped to make such detailed references to the President, and the

    Governor would act as the bridge connecting the two. It is only in rare cases,

    where in spite of the evident requirement for the President’s assent in order

    to make the bill effective as an Act (as observed in paragraph 86 of Hoecsht

    (supra)), the Council of Ministers has failed to advice the Governor to

    reserve the bill for the President, should the Governor decide to reserve the

    bill on his own motion.
316. The deletion of the words “in his discretion” from Section 75 of the GoI Act,

     1935 before adapting it as
Article 200
of the Constitution must be

     understood in the right context. The GoI Act, 1919 introduced an element of

     provincial autonomy in the administration of the country, however, the

     Governor remained at the center of administration having reserve as well as

     emergency powers. With the advent of the GoI Act, 1935, the dyarchy at the

     provincial level was abolished, but the Governor, as the agent of the British

     Crown, continued to have the discretion to veto any legislation passed by

     the provincial legislature. The Governor could also in his discretion reserve

     any bill for the consideration of the Governor-General. This power of the

     Governor was to be essentially exercised in accordance with the directions

     of the Governor-General. However, with the dawn of independence, and the

     framing of the Constitution, the model of governance which was adopted

     allowed the States to be supreme in their respective fields, with certain

     powers having been reserved for the Union to ensure the integrity of the

     nation and uniformity of policy in certain key areas. The Governor was no

     more required to have an all-pervasive control over the State and their

     responsibility towards the Union was to the extent of ensuring that the

     administration in the State was being done in conformity with the principles
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                     Page 277 of 414
enshrined in the Constitution. It is in this context that the power of the

    Governor to submit a report to the President under
Article 356
and also the

    power under
Article 200
to reserve a bill for the consideration of the

    President, is to be understood.
318. Thus, we are of the view that the Governor does not possess any discretion

    in the exercise of his functions under
Article 200
and has to mandatorily

    abide by the advice tendered to him by the Council of Ministers. The only

    exceptions to this general rule are as follows:
320. We have extensively discussed in the preceding section that the Governor

     under the scheme of
Article 200
would, as a general rule, be expected to act

     on the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers as provided for under
Article 163(1).
The deletion of the expression “in his discretion” by the

     framers of the Constitution during the course of adapting Section 75 of the

     GoI Act, 1935 into
Article 200
, is a clear indication of their intent to make

     the ordinary exercise of powers of the Governor under
Article 200
subject

     to the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers. However, the aforesaid

     ordinary exercise of power by the Governor is subject to certain exceptions
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                     Page 280 of 414
where the Governor may act in his own discretion, contrary to the advice of

the Council of Ministers. There are two broad circumstances under which it

would be permissible for the Governor to act in his own discretion under
Article 200:
(ii) Secondly, whether the withholding of assent by the President under
Article 201
of the Constitution, could also be said to be beyond the

           scope of judicial scrutiny?
333. It could be argued that the decision taken by the Governor under
Article 200
would be shielded from the scrutiny of the courts by virtue of the immunity

     accorded under
Article 361
of the Constitution. However, in this regard, we

     may only refer to the observations made by this Court in
Rameshwar Prasad
(supra) which leaves no doubt that the immunity enshrined in
Article 361
of

     the Constitution does not preclude or prohibit the courts in any manner from

     looking into the actions of the Governor which by necessary implication

     would include his actions under
Article 200
as well. The relevant

     observations are as follows:
343. The aforesaid observations would indicate that the grant of assent by the

     President to a State legislation falling under
Article 31A
was held to be non-

     justiciable only on the ground that the first proviso to
Article 31A
confers

     the power on the President to take a decision as regards whether assent is to

     be granted or not.
In reply to these averments in the petitions the Under
        Secretary to the Government of Gujarat, Education
        Department has stated in his counter-affidavit that the Bill
        was presented to the Governor of Gujarat after it was passed
        by the Assembly. The Governor of Gujarat reserved the Bill
        for the consideration of the President under
Article 200
of the
        Constitution since he felt that in view of clause 33 of the Bill
        which provided for taking over of the management of a school
        for a limited period in public interest it was necessary to
        reserve the Bill for the consideration of the President.
        Accordingly the Bill was referred to the President. At the
        meeting held in the Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of
        India on August 3, 1973 to discuss the Bill it was suggested
        by the representatives of the Central Government that the
        provisions of the Bill which did not exclude institutions
        established or administered by the minorities from their
        scope were repugnant to
Article 30
of the Constitution and
        therefore the Bill should be suitably amended. It was also
        suggested to the representatives of the State Government that
        it would be better to carry out the requisite amendments by
        promulgating an ordinance. Accordingly the draft of the
        ordinance which was ultimately promulgated as Ordinance 6
        of 1973 was forwarded for the instructions of the President
        under
Article 213(1)
of the Constitution. Thereafter the draft
        of the Ordinance and the Bill were both considered by the
        President and he assented to the said Bill and issued
        instructions as required by the proviso to
Article 213
of the
        Constitution for the promulgation of the said Ordinance on
        September 28, 1973. Accordingly the said Bill became law on
        its publication on the very same day. The Ordinance was
        issued on September 29, 1973. In the circumstances it cannot
        be said that the assent which was given by the President was
        conditional. The records relating to the above proceedings
        were also made available to the court. On going through the
        material placed before us we are satisfied that the President
        had given assent to the Act and it is not correct to say that it
        was a qualified assent.
The Act
which was duly published in
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 309 of 414
the official Gazette contains the recital that the said Act had
            received the assent of the President on September 28, 1973.
            Moreover questions relating to the fact whether assent is
            given by the Governor or the President cannot be agitated
            also in this manner. [...]”
                                              (Emphasis supplied)
73. The above decisions essentially answer the submissions
            which were urged by Dr Dhavan. The law as propounded in
            the line of precedents adverted to above must negate the
            submissions which were urged on behalf of the petitioners.
            Once the Bill (which led to the Reservation Act, 2018) was
            reserved by the Governor for the consideration of the
            President, it was for the President to either grant or withhold
            assent to the Bill. The President having assented to the Bill,
            the requirements of
Article 201
were fulfilled. The validity of
            the assent by the President is non-justiciable. [...]”

                                              (Emphasis supplied)
350. The Constitution Bench in Kaiser-I-Hind (supra) had the occasion to

     consider in detail whether the assent of the President sought with regard to

     a State law would be limited only to the repugnancy of the laws to which the

     attention of the President was drawn to whilst seeking his assent or would

     such assent be qua all other laws enacted by the Parliament to which the

     State law in question may also be repugnant to. In other words, whether the

     assent granted by the President to a State legislation would be deemed to be

     an assent qua all earlier enactments made by the Parliament on the subject.

     This Court whilst answering the aforesaid question in the negative, held that

     the “consideration” by the President and his “assent” under
Article 254(2)
is limited to the proposal made by the State government and, the State

     legislation would prevail only qua the laws for which repugnancy was

     pointed out and the “assent” of the President was sought for. The Court,

     inter alia, held that the words “reserved for consideration” indicate the
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                     Page 313 of 414
requirement of an active application of mind by the President to the

     repugnancy pointed out between the proposed State law and the earlier law

     made by the Parliament and the necessity of having such a law in the State,

     keeping in mind the peculiar facts, the attending circumstances and the

     backdrop in which such law was made by the State government. Similarly,

     the word “consideration” indicates the requirement of careful thinking and

     due application of mind regarding the necessity of having a State law which

     is repugnant to the law(s) made by the Parliament. Lastly, the term “assent”

     implies an expressed agreement of mind to what is proposed by the State

     i.e., knowledge of the President as to the repugnancy between the State law

     and the earlier law(s) made by Parliament on the same subject-matter, as

     well as agreement to the reason and attending circumstances, regarding the

     necessity of having such State law.
Necessarily, in the quasi-federal structure adopted for the
        nation, predominance is given to the law made by Parliament
        and in such circumstances only the State law which secured
        the assent of the President under clause (2) of
Article 254
comes to be protected, subject of course to the powers of
        Parliament under the proviso to the said clause. Therefore,
        the President has to be apprised of the reasons at least as to
        why his assent is being sought, the need or necessity and the
        justification or otherwise for claiming predominance for the
        State law concerned. This itself would postulate an
        obligation, inherent in the scheme underlying as well as the
        very purpose and object of seeking the assent under clause
        (2) of
Article 254
, to enumerate or specify and illustrate the
        particular Central law or provision with reference to which
        the predominance is desired. The absence of any
        standardized or stipulated form in which it is to be sought for,
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 317 of 414
should not detract the State concerned, to disown its
        obligation to be precise and specific in the extent of
        protection sought having regard to the serious consequences
        which thereby inevitably follow i.e. the substitution of the
        Union law in force by the State law, in the territorial limits of
        the State concerned, with drastic alteration or change in the
        rights of citizen, which it may, thereby bring about.
76. Different provisions of the Constitution envisage the
        grant of assent by the President as well as the Governor of a
        State.
Article 111
provides for the assent of the President to
        a Bill passed by the Houses of Parliament, in the same
        manner in which
Article 200
empowers the Governor of a
        State in respect of a Bill passed by the Legislative Assembly
        or by the Houses of the legislature where there is a
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 321 of 414
Legislative Council in addition to the Assembly. Parliament
        for the Union consists of the President and two Houses as the
        legislature of States consists of the Governor and the House
        or Houses, as the case may be (vide
Articles 79
and
168
). The
        policy-making executive power of the Union also vests with
        the President, as the executive power of the State vests with
        the Governor, and those powers have to be exercised with the
        aid and advice of the Council of Ministers, for the Union
        headed by the Prime Minister and for the State to be headed
        by the Chief Minister. The President or the Governor, as the
        case may be, as and when a Bill after having been passed is
        presented, may accord assent or as soon as possible
        thereafter return the Bill to the Houses with a message
        requesting to reconsider the Bill or any provisions thereof,
        including the introduction of any amendment as
        recommended in his message and if thereafter the Houses on
        reconsideration of the Bill, pass the Bill again with or without
        amendment and present the same for the assent, the
        President/Governor, as the case may be, shall not withhold
        his assent. Being an exercise pertaining to expression of
        political will, apparently, the will of the people expressed
        through the legislation passed by their elected
        representatives is given prominence by specifically providing
        for a compulsory consent or assent. The same could not be
        said with reference to the “assent” of the President envisaged
        under
Articles 31-A
, 31-C
, 254(2)
and
304(b)
of the
        Constitution. In my view, the “assent” envisaged in these
        articles by the very nature and character of the powers
        conferred constitute a distinct class and category of their
        own, different from the normal “assent” envisaged under
Articles 111
of the President or
Article 200
of the Governor.
Article 201
also would indicate that even when for the second
        time the Houses of the State Legislature pass the Bill and
        present for “consideration”, there is no compulsion for the
        President to accord assent. Therefore, the reservation of any
        Bill/Act for the “consideration” of the President for
        according his assent, keeping in view, also the avowed object
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 322 of 414
envisaged under
Article 254(2)
, renders it qualitatively
        different from the ordinary assent to be given by the President
        to a Bill passed by Parliament or that of the Governor to a
        Bill passed by the legislature(s) of the State concerned.
353. It is pertinent to note that it was observed by Doraiswamy, J., that the assent

     of the President under
Article 254(2)
is not of the same nature as the assent

     of the President or the Governor under
Article 111
and
200
of the

     Constitution respectively. He placed strong emphasis on the use of the

     expression “consideration” in
Article 254(2)
to hold that such a

     consideration by the President would be meaningless in the absence of a

     clear and specific reference made to him pointing out the repugnancy

     between the Central law and the proposed State law.
354. While the observations made in Kaiser-I-Hind (supra) as regards the import

     of the expression “consideration” were in the context of
Article 254(2)
, the
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 324 of 414
same would apply to every bill reserved for the consideration of the

    President under
Article 201
as the expression “consideration” finds a

    mention in
Article 201
as well. Thus, the reservation for the consideration

    of the President must be accompanied by a reference which contains specific

    details as regards the purpose why the consideration of the President is

    sought.
363. The observations in the aforesaid decisions as regards the non-justiciability

     of the assent of the President under
Article 201
cannot be construed to mean

     that the withholding of assent and reservation of bills by the Governor under
Article 200
, as well as withholding of assent by the President under
Article

     201
are beyond the scope of judicial review. The observations of non-

     justiciability of assent of the President under
Article 201
can be explained

     in light of the assent under
Article 201
being predominantly a matter of

     federal policy of the Union government. On certain subject matters

     prescribed in various provisions of the Constitution, and on subject matters

     falling in the Concurrent List, the Constitution has accorded primacy to the

     Centre over the States. On issues of repugnancy, for illustration, it is only

     on the approval of the President, that a State law which is repugnant to a

     Central legislation can become enforceable. No obligation is placed on the

     President to grant assent under
Article 201
and it is to be decided by the

     President on the aid and advice of the Union Council for Ministers. It is in

     view of this position and for the limited extent of judicially manageable

     standards of evaluation that the assent under
Article 201
has been described

     as non-justiciable.
364. However, the same is not the case when the courts have to consider the

     withholding of assent or reservation of bills by the Governor under Article
365. The discharge of functions by the President under
Article 201
stands on a

    different footing than that of the Governor under
Article 200.
While there is

    no political hue to the limited discretion conferred upon the Governor under
Article 200
, and any exercise of such discretion has to be solely on

    constitutional grounds, the grant of assent under
Article 201
has an element

    of political hue by virtue of the fact that the President under
Article 201
has

    been given the prerogative to decide whether the grant of assent in certain

    cases would be desirable or not. However, at the same time, what must be

    remembered is that it is only in those areas where the primacy has been given
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 331 of 414
to the Union would this political consideration be permissible. Additionally,

     this political hue is not owing to the difference in opinion or political views

     of the governments at the Centre and the State but is attributable to the

     desirability of vesting the Union government to exercise certain discretion

     in matters pertaining to broader issues where uniformity in national policy

     may be desirable. In such a case, the scope of justiciability under
Article 201
would be limited to questions of arbitrariness, malafides and inaction.
367. We summarise our findings on the judicial review of the exercise of power

    by the Governor under
Article 200
and by the President under
Article 201
of the Constitution as follows:
Hind (supra). Such a reservation can be assailed by the State

             Government, if the reference made by the Governor either fails

             to indicate the reasons for such reservation as discussed above

             or that the reasons indicated are wholly irrelevant, mala-fide,

             arbitrary,     unnecessary   or   motivated     by    extraneous

             considerations. Then such a reservation would be liable to be

             set aside. This question being purely of a legal nature would be

             completely justiciable and the competent court would be after

             a proper adjudication fully authorized to approve or disapprove

             of such reservation by the Governor. If such a challenge finds

             favour with the competent court, then, subject to any other

             considerations, it would be fit case for issuance of a writ in the

             nature of mandamus to the Governor for appropriate action. If

             however, the challenge should fail then the mechanism

             envisaged under
Article 201
of the Constitution will spring into

             action.
368. We summarise our findings on the judicial review of the exercise of power

    by the President under Article 201in withholding assent to a bill as follows:
370. As we have discussed,
Article 200
provides three courses of action to the

      Governor when a bill is presented to him - to assent, to withhold assent or to

      reserve the bill for the consideration of the President. If he declares assent,

      then the bill becomes an Act of the State legislature. If he withholds assent,

      then the procedure prescribed under the first proviso springs into motion.

      However, the procedure which is to be followed once a bill is reserved for

      the consideration of the President is provided in
Article 201
of the

      Constitution.
Article 201
was adopted without any debate in the Constituent

      Assembly on 01st August, 1949. It reads as follows:
371. A plain reading of
Article 201
indicates that once a bill is reserved by the

     Governor for the consideration of the President, the President has two

     options to choose from - he may either assent to the bill, which would bring

     the legislative process to a conclusion and the bill would become an act, or

     he may withhold his assent to the bill.
372. The proviso to
Article 201
provides that in case of bills other than money

     bills, the President may direct the Governor to return the bill to the State

     legislature together with a message as is mentioned in the first proviso to
Article 200.
Once the bill is so returned, the State legislature is required to

     reconsider the bill in light of the suggestions of the President within a period

     of six months and if the Bill is passed again, with or without amendments,

     it shall be presented again to the President for his consideration.
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 341 of 414
373. There are some features of
Article 201
which are markedly different from
Articles 111
and
200.
The proviso to
Article 111
as well as the first proviso

    to
Article 200
mandate the President and the Governor respectively to assent

    to a bill which has been reconsidered by the Parliament and State legislature

    respectively and presented to them for the second time. However, the

    proviso to
Article 201
does not place any such obligation on the President

    to mandatorily accord assent to a bill which is placed before him after

    reconsideration by the State legislature. This is evident from the absence of

    the expression “shall not withhold assent therefrom” in the proviso to Article
201. This is also brought out from the difference between the language

    employed in
Articles 111
and
200
vis-a-vis that employed in
Article 201.
The first proviso to
Article 111
uses the expression “and if the Bill is passed

    again by the Houses with or without amendment and presented to the

    President for assent”. Similarly, the first proviso to
Article 200
also uses the

    expression “and if the Bill is passed again by the House or Houses with or

    without amendment and presented to the Governor for assent”. However,

    the proviso to
Article 201
uses the expression “and, if it is again passed by

    the House or Houses with or without amendment, it shall be presented again

    to the President for his consideration”. Instead of the expression “for

    assent”, the proviso to
Article 201
uses the expression “for his

    consideration” thereby indicating that the President is not bound to accord
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 342 of 414
assent to a bill even when it is presented to him for the second time. In other

    words, the object behind presentation of the bill for the second time after

    reconsideration under
Articles 111
and
200
respectively is to obtain assent,

    whereas under
Article 201
, the object of the presentation is to yet again

    present the bill for the consideration of the President.
374. Further, the proviso to
Article 201
places an obligation on the State

    legislature to reconsider the bill in accordance with the suggestions of the

    President within a period of six months from the date of receipt of the

    message containing the suggestions. There is no similar obligation on the

    Parliament or the State legislature to reconsider the bill within a stipulated

    time period under
Articles 111
and
200
respectively. This absence of this

    six-month time period under
Articles 111
and
200
respectively could also be

    seen as an indication of the primacy which is accorded to the Parliament and

    State Legislature as regards the bill which is presented for assent under the

    said provisions. They may choose to repass the Bill after taking into account

    the message which has been sent without being bound by the rigours of a

    time-limit. This is because it is they who ultimately decide whether the bill

    would see the light of day or not, as far as
Articles 111
or 200 are concerned.

    As discussed by us in the preceding paragraphs, under
Articles 111
and
200
respectively, the bill would only “fall through” if the Parliament or the State

    Legislature chooses or elects not to repass the concerned bill after it has been
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 343 of 414
returned to them and the trust of expediency has been reposed on the

    constitutional head of the country and State, being the President and the

    Governor respectively. However, under
Article 201
, the prescription of the

    time-limit of six months for the State legislature to reconsider the bill

    returned to them, is indicative of the fact that the requirement to act

    expediently is also placed on the State legislature.
377. Dr. K.C. Markandan writes that
Article 201
seeks to serve the same purpose

         in the legislative sphere as
Article 365
seeks to do in the administrative

         sphere, namely, make the Constitution “unfederal” in character, to establish

         the fact that the distribution of legislative power between the Centre and the

         States is not on an exclusive basis but that the exercise of legislative power

         of the State is subject to the overall responsibility of the Centre and its

         legislative ambit. He states that no other explanation can justify the inclusion

         of this provision in the Constitution.31
379. The features of
Article 201
which have been the cause of differences in

     Centre-State relations over the years are as follows:
382. While the language of
Article 201
does not provide for any timelines within

     which the President is required to act, the absence of a time limit cannot be

     construed as indicating that the discharge of functions by the President under

     the said Article can be done without due deference to the important nature

     of the role they occupy as regards the legislative machinery of the State. Any

     bill(s) reserved for the consideration of the President cannot become an act

     unless it receives the assent as is mentioned in
Article 201
, and thus, long

     and undue delays in the disposal of references by the President would have

     the effect of keeping the bill(s), which are an expression of the popular will

     embodied by the State legislature, in an indefinite and uncertain state of

     abeyance.
383. Although we are cognisant of the fact that in discharge of his powers under
Article 201
, the President is expected to “consider” the bill and such

     “consideration” may be difficult to be bound by strict timelines, yet it cannot

     be a ground to justify inaction on part of the President.
384. We have discussed in detail in the preceding paragraphs that where no time

     for the exercise of a power has been stipulated, such power must be

     exercised in a reasonable time, so as to not render the subject matter

     nugatory or dilute the purpose sought to be achieved. The delay on part of

     the President in deciding a reference under
Article 201
, without any

     justification or necessity, would fall foul of the basic constitutional principle

     that the exercise of a power must not be arbitrary and capricious. The

     implications of inaction being of a serious nature and detrimental to the

     federal fabric of the Constitution, there should be no scope for unnecessary

     delay on part of the President under
Article 201
as well.
389. It becomes clear upon the perusal of the guidelines that in recognition of the

     urgent and important nature of
Article 201
, the Central Government has

     framed clear guidelines as regards the time limits and the manner in which

     references under
Article 201
are expected to be disposed of. The guidelines

     also lay down that any delay caused in the seeking of clarifications and

     making of suggestions by any Ministry would have to be explained by

     furnishing reasons, in the absence of which, it would be assumed that they

     have no objections. It would be apposite for us to observe here that the idea

     of imposing timelines on the various stakeholders would not be antithetical

     or alien to the procedure that surrounds the discharge of constitutional

     functions under
Article 201.
The existence of the aforesaid two Office

     Memorandums further substantiates such an interpretation. Afterall, no

     memorandum which is contrary to the substance and spirit of
Article 201
can be allowed to command any procedure between the Union and the States

     The factum of its existence and acceptance reveals that the requirement of

     expeditious or even a strict time-bound action would be consistent with the

     aim and object of
Article 201.
392. We may now advert ourselves to the question on the nature of the proviso to
Article 201
and whether it is intrinsically attached to the option of

     withholding of assent available to the President under
Article 201
, similar to

     how the first proviso is fastened to the option of withholding assent available
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 359 of 414
to the Governor under
Article 200.
Furthermore, how and in what scenarios

    would the President resort to directing the Governor to return the bill to the

    House or Houses together with a message?
201. Despite this, we must not lose sight of the fact that it was also

    authoritatively
laid down in
the same decision that a proviso may fulfil the

    purpose of being an exception or, explanation/addition to the substantive

    provision of a statute. Therefore, despite the absence of a similar expression

    mandating the President to not withhold assent in the proviso to
Article 201
,

    constitutional principles would require us to read the proviso in conjunction

    with the option of withholding assent which the President is empowered to

    choose from.
395. Since the notion of ‘simpliciter withholding’ is an anathema to
Article 200
of the Constitution, there cannot be any gainsaying that any ‘withholding of

     assent’ in terms of
Article 201
must also only take place on the strength of

     a specific provision of the Constitution that envisages the requirement of

     assent of the President in the first place i.e., those traceable to instances

     envisaged under Article(s) 31A
, 31C
, 254(2)
, 288(2)
, 360(4)(i)(a)
, etc. but

     also must be accompanied by sound and specific reasons that necessitate the

     withholding, by clearly outlaying the policy considerations on which such

     an action is predicated.
396. While in the preceding paragraphs we have elaborated that the Governor

     does not hold the power to exercise ‘absolute veto’ on any bill, we see no

     reason why the same standard would also not apply to the President under
Article 201
as well. The President is not an exception to this default rule

     which permeates throughout our Constitution. Such unbridled powers

     cannot be said to remain in either of these constitutional posts. The only

     exception that has been carved out by the Constitution as regards the

     exercise of powers by the Governor and that of the President under Article(s)
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                     Page 361 of 414
200 and
201
of the Constitution is that in the former, the Governor once

    having withheld assent from a bill would then be bound to assent upon the

    reconsideration of such bill, whereas in the latter no such compulsion is

    constitutionally imagined for the President, owing to the very fact that the

    grant or withholding of assent in terms of
Article 201
is not the ordinary

    law-making procedure so far as the States are concerned, it is an

    extraordinary situation that only arises wherever policy considerations are

    involved in an otherwise State legislation but nevertheless having the

    propensity of a pan-country effect that is necessitated by the very quasi-

    federal nature of our polity.
399. However, at this stage we may clarify, that although the Memorandum

    mandates that there must be a channel of transparent and purposeful

    communication between the State Government and the Central Government,

    yet this does not mean that the requirement of sending a message in terms

    of the proviso to
Article 201
is eliminated. Mere existence of any

    communication that may take place prior to any decision being taken under
Article 201
is no reason to shirk the constitutional responsibility of officially

    communicating the message to the concerned State legislature. There lies a

    very fundamental difference between the communication envisaged under

    the Memorandum and that under the proviso to
Article 201.
The former is

    only to address any preliminary objections or doubts as regards the proposed

    bill and which prevent a meaningful decision from being taken by the
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 364 of 414
President under
Article 201
whereas under the latter, the idea is to

     communicate the reasons as to how the President arrived at his decision to

     withhold assent along with specifying the provisions of the proposed bill

     that should be reconsidered by the State legislature.
400. In other words, the sending of preliminary objections under the

     Memorandum cannot be equated to the message under the proviso to
Article

     201
, which is used to communicate the aspects of the proposed bill to be

     reconsidered and how they may be reconsidered by the State legislature.

     Unlike the memorandum, the message under
Article 201
of the Constitution

     is of seminal significance inasmuch as it facilitates the repassing of the bill

     by the State legislature. What emerges from the aforesaid is that when the

     President declares the withholding of assent of the State legislature’s

     proposed bill, it would be his constitutionally bounden duty to also set into

     motion the proviso to
Article 201.
401. In short, after due consultation with the State government, the President may

     either declare assent to the bill or he may declare that he withholds assent

     thereto. It would not be appropriate for the President to declare withholding

     of assent without first seeking clarifications from the State government as is

     mentioned in the guidelines featuring in the Office Memorandums. If, in the

     course of discussions, the State government expresses willingness to make
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 365 of 414
such changes to the bill as may be suggested by the Central government,

    then it would be open to the President to seek reconsideration of the bill by

    invoking the proviso, and upon the bill being re-considered and passed with

    such changes, the President may grant assent thereto.
402. At this stage, it would be prudent for the President while choosing to

    withhold assent to the bill and setting the proviso into motion, to address the

    issues, views, changes, amendments or recommendations that he may have

    comprehensively and in one go. Piecemeal exercise of the proviso to
Article

    201
must be dissuaded. This is to prevent the endless loop of sending and

    re-sending of the bill that may ensue between the President acting under the

    proviso to
Article 201
and the House or Houses of the State Legislature. A

    purposive interpretation of
Article 201
does not in any manner envisage a

    never-ending cycle of communications between the President and the State

    Government. Such conduct would tantamount to abusing the essence of the

    proviso which embodies fostering a collaborative spirit between the Union

    and the States. Therefore, the exercise of the power under the proviso must

    also be done in good faith and in a bona fide manner.
403. The object underlying
Article 201
and the significance it holds for the

    enforceability of a State legislation would be frustrated if the procedure

    therein is reduced to an endless cycle of back and forth without any chance
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 366 of 414
for fruition of the aspirations of the people of the State on mere

     technicalities. Therefore, the President is expected to follow the procedure

     envisaged under the proviso with a sense of responsibility whenever

     necessary. In the ordinary course of action, a bill must be sent back for the

     reconsideration of the State legislature under the proviso to
Article 201
, only

     once.
404. After the bill is sent with a message to State legislature by the President and

     they repass it, with or without amendments, the President would be

     empowered to take a final call on the giving or withholding of assent on the

     bill concerned. If he chooses to assent to the bill, it would become law. There

     is no gainsaying to the fact that the President under
Article 201
is conferred

     with the power to withhold a bill during the second round, without activating

     any other procedure, effectively bringing the legislative process vis-à-vis

     that same bill to an end, in contrast to the scheme of
Article 200
wherein the

     Governor must mandatorily accord his assent to a Bill which is presented to

     him for the second time.
415. The view taken In Re: Special Courts (supra) was that consultative

    jurisdiction under
Article 143
may avoid any possible challenges to the vires
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 375 of 414
of a bill if it becomes an Act. On basis of the dictum in the said reference,

    we are of the considered view that constitutional courts are not precluded

    from making suggestions or opining about the constitutional validity of a

    bill before the same becomes a law. This is because preventing a patently

    unconstitutional bill from being enacted saves not only public resources but

    also respects the wisdom of the legislature by providing the constitutional

    functionaries associated with the process of passage of a legislation, to

    review the bill and take appropriate actions. However, the approach of

    prevention before cure cannot be stretched to such extent, that the very

    process of reservation becomes a resort for thwarting the very legislative

    powers of the States. The President’s recourse to
Article 143
also palliates

    any apprehensions of bias or mala fides in the Central government’s

    approach to bills reserved under
Article 200.
424. We would also like to make a reference to Rule 48 of the Tamil Nadu

    Government Business Rules, 1978. The said Rule provides that whenever

    there is legislative proposal for a subject matter falling within the Concurrent

    List, the concerned administrative department should consult the Ministry

    of Home Affairs, whenever possible. Similar requirement is laid down for

    the legislations falling under
Articles 31A
, 31B
and
31C
of the Constitution.

    The rules read as follows:
426.
Article 142
of the Constitution empowers this Court, in the exercise of its

       jurisdiction to, pass such decree or make such order as is necessary for doing

       complete justice in any cause or matter pending before it.
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 388 of 414
(V)      Neither the concept of ‘pocket veto’ nor that of ‘absolute veto’ finds

         place within the constitutional scheme and mechanism envisaged

         under
Article 200
of the Constitution. The substantive part of
Article 200
consciously uses the expression “shall declare” to

         signify that there is no scope of inaction, and whenever a bill is

         presented to the Governor, he is under a constitutional obligation to

         adopt one of the three courses of action available therein. Further,

         the expression “as soon as possible” in the first proviso permeates
Article 200
with a sense of expediency and does not allow the

         Governor to sit on the bills and exercise pocket veto over them.

         Similarly, by virtue of the first proviso being intrinsically and

         inextricably attached to the option of withholding of assent, there

         is no scope for the Governor to declare a simpliciter withholding of

         assent, meaning thereby that ‘absolute veto’ is also impermissible

         under
Article 200.
(VI)     It goes without saying that the scheme of
Article 200
is

         characterized by the movement of the bill from one constitutional

         authority to another and that too with a sense of expediency. It is

         trite to say that
Article 200
occupies an important role of giving the

         bills passed by the State legislature the authority of an Act. Without

         the procedure envisaged under
Article 200
, the bills remain mere
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 389 of 414
pieces of paper, skeletons without any flesh or lifeblood flowing

         through their veins, mere documentation of the aspirations of the

         people without any possibility of bringing them to fruition.


(VII)    As a general rule, it is not open for the Governor to reserve a bill

         for the consideration of the President once it is presented to him in

         the second round, after having been returned to the House

         previously as per the first proviso. The use of the expression “shall

         not withhold assent therefrom” appearing in the first proviso places

         a clear embargo on the Governor and is a clear enunciation of the

         requirement that the Governor must assent to a bill which is

         presented to him after complying with the procedure
laid down in
the first proviso. The only exception to this general rule is when the

         bill presented in the second round is materially different from the

         one presented to the Governor in the first instance, as discussed in

         paragraph 204 of this judgment. In such a scenario, it would be

         open for the Governor to choose from the three options provided in

         the substantive part of
Article 200.
(X)      There is no expressly specified time-limit for the discharge of the

         functions by the Governor under
Article 200
of the Constitution.

         Despite there being no prescribed time-limit,
Article 200
cannot be

         read in a manner which allows the Governor to not take action upon

         bills which are presented to him for assent and thereby delay and

         essentially roadblock the law-making machinery in the State.


(XI)     The use of the expression “as soon as possible” in the first proviso

         makes it clear that the Constitution infuses a sense of urgency upon

         the Governor and expects him to act with expediency if he decides

         to declare the withholding of assent.
(iv) In case of presentation of a bill after reconsideration in

                accordance with the first proviso, the Governor must grant

                assent forthwith, subject to a maximum period of one-month.



(XV)     As the general rule, the Governor in exercise of his functions under
Article 200
is required to abide by the aid and advice tendered by
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 393 of 414
the Council of Ministers. The only exceptions to this rule can be

         traced to the second proviso to
Article 200
and
Article 163(1)
of

         the Constitution. Thus, only in instances where the Governor is by

         or under the Constitution required to act in his discretion, would he

         be justified in exercising his powers under
Article 200
contrary to

         the advice of the Council of Ministers. Further, any exercise of

         discretion by the Governor in exercise of his powers under
Article

         200
is amenable to judicial review.
The removal of the expression “in his discretion” from

         Section 75 of the GoI Act, 1935 when it was being adapted as
Article 200
of the Constitution clearly indicates that any discretion

         which was available to the Governor under the GoI Act, 1935 in
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 394 of 414
respect of reservation of bills became unavailable with the

         commencement of the Constitution.
Under
Article 200
of the Constitution, the Governor does not

         possess any discretion in the exercise of his functions and has to

         mandatorily abide by the advice tendered to him by the Council of

         Ministers. The only exceptions to this general rule are as follows:
(XVIII) There is no ‘pocket veto’ or ‘absolute veto’ available to the

         President in discharge of his functions under
Article 201.
The use

         of the expression “shall declare” makes it mandatory for the

         President to make a choice between the two options available under

         the substantive part of
Article 201
, that is, to either grant assent or

         to withhold assent to a bill. The constitutional scheme does not, in

         any manner, provide that a constitutional authority can exercise its

         powers under the Constitution arbitrarily. This necessarily implies

         that the withholding of assent under
Article 201
is to be

         accompanied by the furnishing of reasons for such withholding. We

         cannot say for a moment that the President would be allowed to not

         exercise the proviso to
Article 201
and not communicate reasons

         for the withholding of assent to the State legislature, as doing so

         would make the very inclusion of the proviso in
Article 200
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 398 of 414
redundant. Thus, the proviso to
Article 201
could be said to attach

         with the option of withholding of assent.
(XXIV) We summarise our findings on judicial review of the exercise of

         power by the Governor under
Article 200
and the exercise of power

         by the President under
Article 201
as follows:
(ii)     Where the reservation is on account of the bill attracting

                     any provision of the Constitution wherein the assent of

                     the President is a condition precedent for the proper

                     enactment and enforceability of such a bill as a law

                     (such as under Article 364A2) or for the purpose of

                     securing any immunity (such as under
Article 31A
) or

                     overcoming any repugnancy that may exist qua a

                     Central Legislation (under
Article 254(2)
), then the

                     Governor is expected to make a specific and clear

                     reference to the President properly indicating the

                     reasons for such reservation and inviting his attention as

                     described in Kaiser-I-Hind (supra). Such a reservation

                     can be assailed by the State Government, if the

                     reference made by the Governor either fails to indicate

                     the reasons for such reservation as discussed above or

                     that the reasons indicated are wholly irrelevant, mala-
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 403 of 414
fide, arbitrary, unnecessary or motivated by extraneous

                     considerations. Then such a reservation would be liable

                     to be set aside. This question being purely of a legal

                     nature would be completely justiciable and the

                     competent court would be after a proper adjudication

                     fully authorized to approve or disapprove of such

                     reservation by the Governor. If such a challenge finds

                     favour with the competent court, then, subject to any

                     other considerations, it would be fit case for issuance of

                     a writ in the nature of mandamus to the Governor for

                     appropriate action. If however, the challenge should fail

                     then the mechanism envisaged under
Article 201
of the

                     Constitution will spring into action.
441. The soul of India is its Constitution. Our Republic, the foresight of dynamic

     visionaries. What a great edifice, they built, ensuring sovereignty with

     democratic values. The Constitution is our bedrock ensuring our safety and

     security. It outlines a process that keeps us rooted in values. We read it for

     reference and for every policy decision. Without it, we would be lost and

     make many mistakes. It is now seventy-five years old, but we still keep

     turning to it, why? Because it guarantees our rights and sets benchmarks for

     our responsibilities. The laws and rules that uplift all people sprout from its

     pristine womb, welfare of all is its primary concern, but its sanctity and

     safety should be our prime concern.4.   This Court issued notice to the respondents on 10.11.2023. The Governor,

     forthwith, took a decision on the 12 Bills on 13.11.2023 by withholding

     assent simpliciter to 10 bills i.e., he did not convey any message to the State

     Legislature for reconsideration of the said Bills as prescribed under the first
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                         Page 5 of 414
proviso to
Article 200
, and by reserving two Bills for the consideration of

     the President. The 10 bills for which assent was withheld were returned to

     the State Legislature by the Governor.
6.   On 28.11.2023, the Governor, without the aid and advice of the Council of

     Ministers of the State, in exercise of his discretion, reserved the said

     repassed Bills for the consideration of the President. The letter of the

     Governor to the Union Government referring the said Bills for the

     consideration of the President mentioned that the Bills were re-considered

     and passed again by the State Legislature. Interestingly, although the

     Governor noted that the Bills were intra-vires the competence of the State

     Legislature having been legislated under Entry 66 of List I, Entry 32 of List
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                          Page 6 of 414
II and Entry 25 of List III, yet he reserved the said Bills for the consideration

of the President in the second round on the ground that the Bills suffered

from repugnancy on account of being contrary to Entry 66 of the Union List

i.e., List I. These grounds have been taken by the Governor to reserve the 10

Bills for consideration of the President. For reference, we have extracted the

relevant portion of the letter pertaining to the Tamil Nadu Fisheries

University (Amendment) Bill, 2023 which reads thus:
i)     Mr. Dwivedi submitted that the various provisions of the

          Constitution stand in harmony and are interdependent. They are not

          isolated silos. They share the ultimate objective of harmonious

          Parliamentary governance, seek welfare of the people and

          implement Parliamentary form of democracy within a federal

          system. Therefore, interpretation of a Constitutional provision

          should accord with these fundamental principles and the basic

          structure of the Constitution.
3. In all other cases, the Governor has three options to choose from

            when the bill is presented before him for the first time – to either

            assent, or withhold assent, or reserve the Bill for the consideration

            of the President.
ii)   He submitted that after the Governor has withheld assent to a bill

         and returned the same to the Legislative Assembly, it is not open to

         the Governor to reserve the said bill for the consideration of the

         President once the Legislative Assembly re-passes it with or
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                         Page 40 of 414
without amendment. If the Governor wants to reserve any bill for

          the consideration of the President, he must do so in the first instance

          when the bill is presented to him for assent. The Governor can

          choose any one of the three options at the first instance but if he

          exercises the option to withhold assent, then the option of reserving

          the bill for the consideration of the President ceases to exist because

          the next step in such a case is to follow the procedure prescribed

          under first proviso to
Article 200.
v)    The Governor can only return the bill when he has withheld the

         assent. The Governor cannot be expected to keep the bill in his

         custody after withholding the assent as it would amount to a

         “pocket veto” or veto which is contrary to the intention of the

         makers of the Constitution. Any acceptance of such “suspended

         animation” doctrine of a Bill, supposedly kept indefinitely pending

         by a Governor, would be grossly violative of the Constitutional

         text, spirit and intent.
iii)   He submitted that the obiter dictum of the Supreme Court is binding

          under
Article 141
to the extent of the observations on points raised
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 48 of 414
and decided by the court in a case. Although the obiter dictum of

         the Supreme Court is binding on all courts yet it only has persuasive

         authority as far as the Supreme Court itself is concerned.
36. Having heard the learned counsel appearing for the parties and having gone

      through the materials on record, the following questions of paramount

      constitutional importance fall for our determination:
49. In the Canadian context, she explains that the royal assent ceremony was

     inherited from the United Kingdom tradition and was used prior to

     Confederation in both Lower and Upper Canada and closely resembled the

     original ceremony used in the United Kingdom. Prior to adoption of the new

     procedure in 2002, Canada was the only remaining Commonwealth country

     to still use the traditional ceremony for royal assent. However, taking

     inspiration from the practice prevailing in other Commonwealth countries

     including Australia and New Zealand, as well as several Canadian

     provinces, the royal assent procedure was modernised by adopting a written

     declaration procedure.
56. However, the Nehru Report of 1928 shortly followed the Commonwealth of

     India Bill, 1925 and was drafted in response to the dissatisfaction with the

     Simon Commission. The Report sought to negative the challenge posed by

     the British that a constitutional document, which is agreeable to all, could

     not be drawn by Indians, and contained elaborate provisions providing the

     mechanism for the purpose of assent to bills.
57. As regards the bills passed by the Parliament, it was stipulated in the Nehru

     Report that a bill would not become an Act until assent was granted by the

     Governor-General. The Governor-General was provided with three options
61. One more document that we would like to refer to is the “Constitution of

    Free India: A Draft” authored by M.N. Roy in 1944. The document proposed
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 84 of 414
a radically different version of assent to bills as distinguished from the

     scheme prevailing under the GoI Act, 1935 or other contemporaneous

     aspirational constitutional documents. The document vested no authority in

     the Governor to withhold assent to a bill passed by the provincial legislature

     or to veto the same. However, the document vested power in the Supreme

     People’s Legislature, which was a joint sitting of both the chambers of the

     Federal Legislature, to veto any provincial legislation. However, this veto

     power was subject to judicial review and the provincial government was

     given the right to challenge the veto before the Supreme Federal Court. The

     relevant provisions are reproduced hereinbelow:
62. What is interesting to note is that the imagination of a provision as regards

     assent to bills, when the country was on the brink of becoming independent
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 85 of 414
from the British rule, was significantly different from the previous versions

     envisaged in times when the freedom struggle was focused more on

     obtaining greater degree of self-rule while being under the sovereignty of

     the British Crown, as can be seen in the versions used in the Nehru Report

     and the Constitution of India Bill, 1925. The two documents which were

     drafted in 1944, and are
referred to above
, indicate that the Governor was

     vested with lesser powers and discretion, and there was a clear inclination

     towards a more unitary arrangement insofar as assent to bills was concerned.

     The ideas of judicial review of exercise of veto by the President against a

     state legislation, mandatory return of the bills for reconsideration upon

     withholding of assent, and deemed assent upon reconsideration were being

     experimented with among others in the immediate lead up to the framing of

     our Constitution.
73. With a view to better understand the intention of the framers of the

        Constitution, it is of utmost importance that we turn the pages of the debates

        that took place in the Constituent Assembly.
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 92 of 414
only when so advised by his Cabinet of Ministers. In his opinion, the change

    also meant that the Governor would not be able to veto a bill that has been

    passed twice by the Legislative Assembly, which he felt was not acceptable.
75. Shri. Brajeshwar Prasad acknowledged that there are two classes of cases in

    which a bill can be reserved for the consideration of the President – One,

    where a certain Article of the Constitution requires the same and two, when

    the Governor is advised by his Ministry to do so. However, he advocated for

    a third category i.e., where the Governor would possess the power, in his

    discretion, to veto a bill passed by the Legislature, irrespective of whether it

    was passed once or twice by it. He supported the vesting of discretion in the

    hands of the Governor so that he could veto unjust and unsound legislation

    while also ensuring that there is a check on potentially disruptive legislative

    tendencies. From his standpoint, the fear of disruptive legislation was not

    imaginary but real in our country and he advocated that his proposal was in

    consonance with the traditions of the centralized system of Government that

    existed in our country until independence. He was of the view that the

    parliamentary form of polity was a new experiment to the facts of life in our

    country and it was required to be moderated and regulated. Expressing his

    lack of confidence in the provincial Ministers, he contended that

    empowering the Governor to act in his discretion would not be so

    objectionable since the Governor is also the representative of the
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                         Page 93 of 414
Government of India and it is by virtue of this position that his views must

        prevail over those of the State legislature.
Allegations also came to be levelled by a number of State Governments that

     the Governor in a number of States was acting as an agent of the Central

     Government and the objectivity that was expected of the Governor was not

     being displayed, more particularly when it came to reservation of bills for

     the consideration of the President or recommendation for the imposition of

     emergency under
Article 356.
In light of the aforesaid, certain commissions

     came to be constituted which submitted their reports after undertaking

     exhaustive analysis of the working of the constitutional machinery

     prescribed for Centre-State relations. One of the key foci of these reports

     was the working of
Articles 200
and
201
of the Constitution respectively

     and the scope of exercise of discretion by the Governors, which we deem

     appropriate to discuss hereinafter.
85. The First Administrative Reforms Commission (the “ARC”) was

     established in January 1966 by a resolution of the Ministry of Home Affairs

     to examine the public administration of the country and make

     recommendations for reform and reorganization where necessary. An aspect

     of this exercise was the examination of Centre-State relations particularly
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                   Page 100 of 414
with respect to the need for national integration, and for maintaining

    efficient standards of administration throughout the country.
89. However, no such guidelines have been formulated by the Inter-State

      Council till date and none of the Commissions on Centre-State relations

      constituted thereafter made any recommendations on the issuance of

      guidelines for exercise of discretion by the Governor.
90. The Rajamannar Commission was set up by the Government of Tamil Nadu

      in 1969 under the chairmanship of Dr. P.V. Rajamannar to look into the

      question regarding the relationship that should subsist between the Centre

      and States in a federal set-up. The Commission noted that in the changed

      political circumstances, there can be no dispute regarding the fact that the

      Governors have a positive role to play in the stability and progress of States.

      This requires that the authority of the Governor should be clearly spelt out

      and the Governors should no longer consider themselves to be instruments

      of the Centre under compulsion to act on its directions and in its political

      interests.
98. The Sarkaria Commission was enjoined with the task of reviewing the

    Centre-State relationship and consider the importance of unity and integrity

    of the country for promoting the welfare of the people. One of the facets of

    such review was to discuss the scope of the role of the Governor and its

    impact on the federal polity of India.
99. For a number of years after the independence of India, the political scene

    was dominated by a single party and there was little occasion for strife

    between the central and state governments. The role of the Governor,

    therefore, remained latent. However, post-1967, the emergence of new

    regional political parties led to a discord between the central government

    and those state governments that came to be led by such new regional

    parties. These developments engendered political instability in several
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                    Page 106 of 414
states, as a result of which, the Governors were called upon to exercise their

     discretionary powers more frequently, particularly in recommending

     President’s rule and in reserving State bills for the consideration of the

     President.
100. The role of the Governor in giving assent to State bills, withholding assent

     therefrom or reserving such bills for the consideration of the President, thus,

     assumed importance. By virtue of
Articles 200
and
201
of the Constitution

     respectively, the office of Governor became a major stakeholder for the

     maintenance of a cordial relationship between the central and state

     governments. The Sarkaria Commission was, therefore, tasked with

     providing recommendations regarding the interpretation of the said Articles

     and amendments therein to strengthen the federal polity of India.
115. The Commission noted that the scheme of the Constitution providing for

     reservation of State legislations for the consideration and assent of the

     President, is intended to subserve the broad purpose of cooperative

     federalism in the realm of Union-State legislative relations. Therefore, the

     practice of according assent to a State bill by the President on the reciprocal

     assurance that the changes suggested by him (or the Union Executive) will

     be carried out by way of an ordinance, was not considered to be ideal

     especially when there exists a constitutional remedy under the proviso to
Article 201
itself.
118. As regards the suggestion of streamlining the procedures involved in

     reserving a State bill for consideration of the President, the Commission

     recommended that every reference from the State should be complete and

     clearly established. Such reference should set out precise material facts,

     points for consideration and the reason for making a reference to the

     President. Accordingly, the Commission recommended the following

     information to be necessarily provided for ensuring that the reference to the

     President is self-contained:
124. Before concluding the discussion on the aspect of reservation of bills by the

     Governor for consideration of the President, the Commission noted that

     needless reservation of bills should be avoided. The constitutional scheme

     does not envisage indiscriminate reservation of bills, especially when it is

     being done in his discretion, as the same would be subversive of the federal

     principle and the supremacy of the State legislature.
126. The Commission recommended that bills should be reserved only if required

    for specific purposes falling in the first two classes as extracted hereinabove.
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 120 of 414
State relations as laid down by the Constitution, examined the friction points

      in the working thereof and reviewed the adequacy of the constitutional

      arrangements for promoting social welfare and good governance. One aspect

      of this study involved looking minutely into the role of the Governor in the

      federal polity of India. The Commission noted that the role of the Governor

      became important as he had to balance the political considerations between

      the Centre and State and be as impartial as possible.
132. The Governor is not amenable to the directions of the Union government,

     nor does the Constitution make him accountable to the Centre for the manner

     in which he carries out his functions and duties. The office of Governor is

     an independent constitutional office. The Governor, by virtue of
Article 163
,

     however, is bound by the aid and advice of the State Council of Ministers.

     Therefore, in the event of a conflict between the aid and advice of the State

     Council of Ministers and the dictates of the Central Government, the scheme

     of the Constitution indicates that the Governor must adhere to the former.
133. With the broad tenets of the role of the Governor under the constitutional

     scheme, the Commission, while appraising the existing framework of

     Centre-State relations, observed that a major point of friction between the
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                     Page 123 of 414
Centre and States is the power of the Governor to reserve any State bill for

     the consideration of the President, sometimes even for an indefinite period.
140. Therefore, the Commission suggested that a period of six months should be

    prescribed in
Article 201
for the President to decide on assenting or

    withholding assent to a bill reserved for consideration of the President. In

    case the President on the aid and advice of the Union Council of Ministers,

    is unable to give assent to a State bill under
Article 201
, it is desirable for

    him to make a reference to the Supreme Court under
Article 143
for an

    opinion. Such reference should be done as a matter of practice in order to
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 126 of 414
avoid allegations of political bias, while securing the dignity and authority

     of the State legislature.
141. Having considered the challenges in the exercise of powers under
Articles

     200
and
201
respectively, the Commission reiterated the recommendations

     of the National Commission to Review the Working of the Constitution

     (“NCRWC”), which are reproduced hereinbelow:
(c) If the Bill is reserved for the consideration of the
             President, there should be a time-limit, say of three months,
             within which the President should take a decision whether to
             accord his assent or to direct the Governor to return it to the
             State Legislature or to seek the opinion of the Supreme Court
             regarding the constitutionality of the Act under
Article 143
             (as it happened in the case of Kerala Education Bill in 1958);
(d) When the State Legislature reconsiders and passes the
             Bill (with or without amendments) after it is returned by the
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 127 of 414
Governor pursuant to the direction of the President, the
             President should be bound to grant his assent;
(e) To provide that a ""Money Bill"" cannot be reserved by the
             Governor for the consideration of the President;
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                                   Page 129 of 414
prerogative of the monarch, yet it has long been an established convention

       that the monarch does not withhold it for a bill that has received approval

       from both Houses. The process of Royal Assent comprises two stages: first,

       the signification of the royal assent to a bill via the Royal Sign Manual on

       Letters Patent issued under the Great Seal of the Realm; and secondly, the

       communication of the King’s Assent to both Houses of Parliament. In the

       United Kingdom (UK), royal assent is regarded as a formality and has not

       been refused to a bill since Queen Anne’s reign in 1707.
23. This is compatible with the fundamental tenet of a
        parliamentary form of Government where the power to enact
        legislation is entrusted to the elected representatives of the
        people. The Governor, as a guiding statesman, may
        recommend reconsideration of the entirety of the Bill or any
        part thereof and even indicate the desirability of introducing
        amendments. However, the ultimate decision on whether or
        not to accept the advice of the Governor as contained in the
        message belongs to the legislature alone. That the message
        of the Governor does not bind the legislature is evident from
        the use of the expression “if the Bill is passed again …with
        or without amendments”.
183. Placing reliance on the expression “unless the procedure indicated in the

    first proviso is followed” the learned Attorney General submitted that the

    decision as regards whether the procedure prescribed under the first proviso

    is to be invoked or not, is the discretion of the Governor. It is only when the

    Governor decides to return the withheld bill along with a message that the

    first proviso would come into play. In other words, if the Governor believes

    that the bill is constitutionally infirm and beyond any remedial changes, then

    he may choose not to return the bill along with a message and may simply

    declare that he is withholding assent to the bill, in which case the bill would

    “fall through” or lapse.
184. Although the argument is seemingly lucrative and appealing, and the

    petitioner also could not provide a concrete reply to the same during the

    course of the arguments and instead took shelter under the semantics of

    obiter-dicta and ratio-decidendi, yet we deem it necessary to explain how

    the argument is short-sighted, half-baked and suffers from an inherent

    fallacy.
192. Therefore, the use of the expression “the Bill falls through unless the

    procedure indicated in the first proviso is followed” should be construed in

    the context of the entire procedure described in the first proviso. Seen thus,

    it would mean that the bill would fall-through if the bill, having been

    returned by the Governor, is not passed again by the State legislature and

    presented again to the Governor for his assent. The fallacy of the argument

    canvassed by the learned Attorney General lies in the very fact that he has

    construed the observations of this Court, pertaining to compliance with the

    procedural requirement under the first proviso, to mean that the mechanism

    under the first proviso can only be initiated upon the desire and discretion of

    the Governor.
195. Any other reading of the provision that construes the option of withholding

     of assent without attaching it to the mechanism prescribed in the first proviso

     would render the very idea of smooth functioning of the law-making process

     nugatory and would vest with the Governor untrammeled powers of

     thwarting the legislative machinery and in effect the will and aspirations of

     the people whose voices the legislature represents.
198. The Governor, in exercise of his powers under
Article 200
, also does not

    possess any absolute veto. He is mandated to take a decision from among

    the three options that are provided in the substantive part of the
Article 200.
In case of withholding of assent, the Governor is bound to follow the

    procedure prescribed under the first proviso and assent to the bill if it is

    ultimately presented to him for assent after being repassed by the State

    legislature. The Governor may also reserve certain bills for the consideration

    of the President. However, in no case has the Governor been conferred with

    the power to veto a bill which is presented to him. He is envisaged as an

    intermediary stop in the journey of the bill towards becoming an Act. When

    a bill comes to the Governor, he may forthwith assent to it, or postpone the

    grant of assent by exercising the option of withholding of assent but only for

    so long till the bill comes back to him after reconsideration, or he may

    forward the bill to the President whereupon the procedure prescribed under
Article 201
is to be followed. Thus, in none of these cases can the Governor

    permanently keep a bill with him without according assent to it, nor can he

    declare a simpliciter withholding of assent thereby killing the bill.
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 167 of 414
ii.    Whether the Governor can reserve a Bill for the consideration of the
       President when it is presented to him for assent after being
       reconsidered in accordance with the first proviso to
Article 200
, more
       particularly, when he had not reserved it for the consideration of the
       President in the first instance?
199. As discussed in the preceding issue, the Governor, in exercise of his powers

      under
Article 200
, has three options to choose from. The use of the

      conjunction “or” between the three options signifies that the options are

      mutually exclusive and once one of the options is exercised by the Governor,

      the other options become unavailable to choose from.
Kameshwar Singh
(supra) held that there can be no reservation for the consideration of the

      President once assent is declared and similarly, there is no requirement for

      the Governor to assent to the bill, once the bill, having been reserved for the

      consideration of the President, has received his assent.
204. However, for the sake of completeness, we deem it necessary to discuss a

    possible scenario wherein the Governor may have the power to reserve the
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 170 of 414
bill for the consideration of the President even after it is repassed by the State

    legislature and presented to him for assent. Say, for instance, in a particular

    case, the Governor withholds assent to a bill which is presented to him and

    returns it to the House or the Houses together with a message requesting

    them to reconsider certain aspects of the bill or introduce certain

    amendments desirable thereto. However, the House or the Houses, in the

    process of reconsideration, introduce certain changes which were not

    suggested by the Governor in the message which he sent together with the

    bill. In such a scenario, the House or Houses cannot be said to have

    “reconsidered the Bill accordingly” which is a mandatory condition

    prescribed under the first proviso. If the bill which is presented to the

    Governor for assent in the second round could be said to have been

    reconsidered by the House or Houses on wholly different and new grounds,

    and if those changes are of such a nature where a reservation for the

    consideration of the President may be desirable, then the Governor would

    not be precluded from reserving the bill for the consideration of the

    President.
205. However, if the bill is repassed by the House or Houses without

    amendments, or only with such amendments as were suggested by the

    Governor in his message, then the procedure prescribed under the first

    proviso could be said to be fully complied with and the Governor would be
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                         Page 171 of 414
bound to signify his assent thereto and would be precluded from reserving

     the bill for the consideration of the President.
207. As we shall also discuss later, any reservation of a bill by the Governor for

     the consideration of the President on the ground that the bill was not

     reconsidered as per the procedure prescribed in the first proviso would be

     subject to judicial scrutiny.
208. Coming to the facts of the present case, out of twelve bills which are the

     subject matter of the present petition, two were reserved by the Governor for

     the consideration of the President in the first instance of their presentation.
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 172 of 414
As regards the remaining ten bills, the Governor declared a withholding of

    assent, however, the bills were returned without any message as is envisaged

    under the first proviso. What stands out as a glaring omission on the part of

    the Governor is that the day on which the withholding of assent was

    declared, the decision in
State of Punjab
(supra) had already been passed

    and even the notice in the present petition had been issued. Thus, it was

    expected of the Governor that he would not declare a simpliciter withholding

    of assent of the bills without specifying the reasons for such withholding and

    also without making recommendations as regards the desirability of

    introducing any amendments by the State legislature while reconsidering the

    bills.
210. In the absence of any message under the first proviso by the Governor, the

    State legislature was left with no other option but to proceed on the

    assumption that the bills were required to be reconsidered in its entirety. The
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 173 of 414
State legislature proceeded on this assumption and the said 10 Bills were

       reconsidered in a special sitting and were passed without any material

       changes and presented to the Governor on the same day. Thereafter, the

       Governor, rather than giving his assent to the Bills, went on to reserve the

       Bills for the consideration of the President on the ground that the Bills were

       repugnant to Entry 66 of the List I of the Schedule VII to the Constitution.
211. For the reasons that we have assigned in our foregoing discussion, we are of

       the view that the Governor could not have reserved the Bills for the

       consideration of the President once they were reconsidered by the State

       legislature and presented to him without any amendments, particularly when

       the Governor sent back the Bills to the State legislature without any message

       on an earlier occasion. As a natural consequence of the reservation of the

       bills for the consideration of the President having been found to be in

       contravention of the procedure prescribed under
Article 200
of the

       Constitution and thus, illegal and void, any subsequent decision taken by the

       President on those Bills would also be non-est and is thus declared to be void

       ab-initio.
215. The arguments advanced before us present an interesting question whether

    it would be open to the courts to read in a time limit for the exercise of a

    power by a constitutional authority where no such limit is prescribed by the

    Constitution. We have expressly held during the course of answering the

    previous issue that the scheme of
Article 200
does not envisage either the

    exercise of a pocket or an absolute veto by the Governor. The use of the

    expression “shall” in the substantive part indicates that the Governor is

    under an obligation to choose from one of the three options that are made

    available to him. By virtue of the first proviso attaching itself to the option

    of withholding of assent, as discussed earlier, the possibility of an absolute

    veto is also ruled out as the Governor must assent to the bill once it is

    presented to him after the procedure prescribed in the first proviso is

    complied with.
The experience of the working of the Constitution, more particularly,
Article

     200
, has shown that the apprehensions expressed by some of the members

     of the Constituent Assembly have unfortunately proven to be prophecy. As

     we have discussed in the preceding paragraphs, one of the prominent

     grievances of the State governments as recorded by the Sarkaria

     Commission and Punchhi Commission reports was that the exercise of the

     power under
Article 200
by the Governor, not being a time-bound process,

     leads to significant legislative delay and that certain bills are withheld in the

     Governor’s secretariat for years.
225. Not taking any action on the bills for an unreasonable and prolonged period

     of time virtually vests the Governor with the power of pocket veto and the

     same cannot be held to be permissible within our constitutional scheme. Dr.

     Singhvi had submitted during the course of his arguments that there is no

     scope for the Governor to decide not to decide.
Article 200
, being the final

     step in the process of the birth of a legislative enactment, the stage wherein
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 181 of 414
life is breathed into an otherwise lifeless document, cannot be interpreted in

    a manner which allows the Governor to remain silent and exhibit inaction

    upon the bills which are submitted to him after having received the approval

    of the majority of the State legislature.
20. Under the Cabinet system of Government
                 as embodied in our Constitution the Governor
                 is the constitutional or formal head of the State
                 and he exercises all his powers and functions
                 conferred on him by or under the Constitution
                 on the aid and advice of his Council of
                 Ministers, save in spheres where the Governor
                 is required by or under the Constitution to
                 exercise his functions in his discretion.
242. When prescribing such a time-limit for the exercise of power under
Article

     200
, we are guided by the inherent expedient nature of the procedure

     prescribed thereunder and the well-settled legal principle that where no time-

     limit for the exercise of a power is prescribed, it should be exercised within

     a reasonable period.
243. What would be a reasonable period would vary from situation to situation,

     however, in the present case, taking guidance from the timelines that have

     been prescribed by the Sarkaria and the Punchhi Commission, we have

     arrived at the view that in the absence of any exceptional circumstances, the

     Governor would be able to exercise his powers under the Article within the

     maximum period prescribed by us.
246. We also deem it necessary to prescribe a timeline for the discharge of

     functions by the Governor under
Article 200.
The Sarkaria and Punchhi

     Commissions in their reports adopted this view, keeping in mind the

     importance of an expeditious decision under
Article 200
for the smooth

     functioning of electoral democracy in the States. An elected government
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                     Page 208 of 414
gets the mandate of the people for a limited period of five-years within which

    it is expected to legislate on issues pertaining to the electorate. If the

    Governor, for whatsoever reasons, exhibits reluctance or lethargy in

    decision making, particularly when it is concerned with the assent to bills, it

    severely impacts the ability of the government to act upon its mandate and

    deliver to the people who brought them into power. Any obstacle created by

    the Governor, whether advertently or inadvertently, severely impacts the

    perception of the elected government in the subsequent elections and thereby

    also negatively affecting their chances of coming back into power. The

    problem is further exacerbated when the political party in power in the State

    is different from the one at the Centre, and the Governor should be more

    cautious and non-partisan in the exercise of his functions in such a scenario.

    Any deliberate inaction on part of the Governor in assenting to bills or

    reserving them for the consideration of the President, thus, has to be viewed

    as a serious threat to the federal polity of the country and the aggrieved

    governments cannot be left remediless, desperately waiting for a decision at

    the hands of the Governor.
249. We have already discussed that in
Keisham
(supra), a three-Judge Bench

    of this Court fixed an outer time-limit of three-months for the Speaker to

    decide disqualification petitions under the Tenth Schedule. The Court

    pertinently observed that the said period was fixed “keeping in mind the fact

    that ordinarily the life of the Lok Sabha and the Legislative Assembly of the

    States is five-years”. This Court has also, in a number of decisions, set down

    and reiterated that the High Courts must pronounce judgments on reserved

    matters within a period of six-months. Inaction on part of any constitutional

    authority being subject to judicial review, it is important that there are

    reasonably laid down standards of justiciability of such inaction, and the

    timelines prescribed by us serve that purpose. Even the Constituent

    Assembly had initially laid down a period of six-weeks for the President to

    take action on bills submitted to him under
Article 111.
However, that was

    later changed to account for any exceptional circumstance that may arise in

    the discharge of functions by the President or the Governor. However, the

    expression “six-months” was replaced with “as soon as possible”, which

    though not determinable, envisages an expeditious disposal of bills, unless

    in cases where some impossibility exists. The prescription of timelines by

    us balances the objective of expediency as well as the desirability of having

    some flexibility in cases of existence of an impossibility in discharge of
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 211 of 414
functions in an expeditious manner. Flexibility in the discharge of a function

     cannot be allowed to be stretched to an extent that renders the very object

     underlying such function otiose, resulting into the proverbial snapping of the

     constitutional machinery.
262. One of the key decisions that the framers of the Constitution had to take was

     to decide the mode of selection of the Governor - whether he should be

     elected by way of a direct election, or selected from a panel of names

     suggested by the State legislature, or nominated by the President. While in

     the early days, the Constituent Assembly leaned towards having an elected

     Governor, as the framing of the Constitution neared its conclusion, there was

     increasing support in favour of having a Governor nominated by the

     President. Jawaharlal Nehru attributed this shift of opinion to the bitter

     experience of partition, which, according to him, opened the eyes of the

     Constituent Assembly to the dangers of separatism and the need for having

a political structure which focused more on the character of the nation as a

        Union of States rather than a federation.
263. The speeches made by some of the members of the Constituent Assembly

        on
Article 155
of the Constitution broadly encapsulate the ideas which were

        debated and rejected before nomination was selected as the mode of

        appointment for the Governor.
264. Speaking in favour of appointment of Governors by Presidential nomination,

        Shri. H.V. Kamath was of the opinion that the concept of an elected

        Governor would undermine the structure of the country as a Union of States,

        since a Governor elected directly by the people on the basis of adult suffrage

        would place more emphasis on India being a federation. However, according

        to him, “the emphasis today is more upon the Union pattern of our State

        than upon its Federal aspect”13. He believed that an elected Governor, being

        a partisan figure, would inevitably clash with the Chief Minister, thereby

        disrupting the functioning of a cabinet-style government. According to him,

        the role of a constitutional head should be impartial and symbolic, and the

        nomination system was better suited to uphold these principles. He further

265. Shri. Hukam Singh, opting for the middle path, acknowledged the

        difficulties inherent in both pure election and pure nomination for the

        purpose of appointment of Governors. While agreeing with Shri. H.V.

        Kamath on the drawbacks of an elected Governor, such as the potential for

conflict with the Chief Minister and the high costs involved in conducting

    elections, he proposed a balanced alternative, suggesting that a panel of

    candidates be nominated by the State legislature and a Governor be chosen

    from the said panel. This method, while allowing for some discretion would

    also ensure public accountability since the merits of those individuals who

    had been recommended in the panel would be publicly available and if the

    right person was not chosen, then the selection would also be criticized

    publicly. In his view, this approach would reduce favoritism, enhance

    transparency, and provide a safeguard against the abuse of power, striking a

    middle ground between the extremes of election and direct nomination.
266. Shri. Rohini Kumar Chaudhari opposed the nomination of Governors,

    cautioning that a Centre-appointed Governor belonging to a different

    political party than the provincial government could lead to discord and

    undermine provincial autonomy. The friction that would result from

    adopting a system wherein Governors are elected would also exist,

    according to him, when a Governor is nominated, since the nominee of the

    President would not work in harmonious tandem with the Ministry of the

    State which belongs to a different political party than the one which enjoys

    power at the Centre. He argued that electing Governors would ensure that

    they are more attuned to the needs of all communities, including

    marginalized groups like tribal populations in States where the Governor
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                    Page 220 of 414
would have an even more important role to play. He criticized the reliance

        on British precedents and advocated for a more democratic process, such as

        election or selection from a panel, to reflect the will of the people and to also

        safeguard provincial interests.
267. Shri. Alladi Krishnaswami Ayyar was of the view that since the Governor is

        merely a constitutional head of the province and the real executive power

        had been vested in a ministry responsible to the Lower House of the different

        States, it seemed rather unnecessary, under such circumstances, to adopt the

        method of election based on universal suffrage for the appointment of the

        Governors. The nomination of Governors by the President would, in his

        opinion, mitigate constitutional conflicts and foster harmonious relations

        between the Governor and the provincial Cabinet. He argued that an elected

        Governor, deriving authority from universal suffrage, might assert

        dominance over the Cabinet, leading to significant constitutional risks. He

        specifically remarked that, “In the normal working of the Government also

        there is danger of a clash between the Minister and the Governor, whereas the

        whole basis of the constitutional structure we are erecting depends upon the

        harmony between the legislature and the executive, and between the executive

        and the formal head of the Government”.15 Drawing inspiration from the

W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 221 of 414
Canadian model, he suggested that the President’s appointment of

        Governors, guided by the advice of the provincial Cabinet, would ensure

        stability and sound governance. Furthermore, according to him, “Nowhere

        does the system of election of the Governor exist where the Institution of

        responsible government is the main feature of the Constitution”.16 He believed

        that this system would better serve the interests of the provinces and the

        nation as a whole.
268. It was his belief that while the method of nomination was the most

        appropriate one, a convention of appointing Governors in consultation with

        the State government would grow. This, when read with the other

        discussions which took place in the Constituent Assembly, indicate that the

        framers of the Constitution reposed trust that the Governor would not be a

        cipher of the Central government, would be a person above party politics

        and would not attempt to override the State government with his actions. He

        also supported the idea of having nominated Governors on the ground that

        the intervention of the Governor would be required only in extraordinary

        situations, and an elected Governor may come in conflict with the provincial

        Cabinet by trying to override their decisions. His words are reproduced

        below:
269. Shri. P.S. Deshmukh was of the opinion that there exist a few fundamental

        considerations which have to be kept in mind while discussing the

        appointment of the Governor. The first of these fundamental considerations

        was that, “if we decide that the Governor should be elected by the province

        on the basis of adult franchise, then it follows logically that he should be a

        real executive authority. On the other hand, if you want him to be mere

        figurehead, if you want him to have exactly the same position as he has today

        under the 1935 Act and which is exactly the position which is assigned to

        him under the Draft Constitution, you cannot but have him appointed by the

        President.”17. In light of this, he buttressed his view that Governors must be

        nominated and not elected. Regarding the concern that adopting a system of

        nominating the Governor would give undue power to the Prime Minister and

        the President, he opined that the Prime Minister would also be a popular

        Prime Minister and that he can only be there as long as he has the support of

        the Parliament elected by the people at large. Therefore, his view was that

        we must not hesitate in giving powers of patronage to the Prime Minister or

        the President. He also expressed concerns about the potential discord

W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 225 of 414
the President to disallow provincial bills directly by overriding the assent of

        the Governor within a certain prescribed period of time from the date of such

        assent, rather than relying on the Governors as intermediaries who refer the

        bill for the consideration of the President, would centralize responsibility

        with the Central Executive and reduce conflicts at the provincial level. In his

        view, this approach would align with the principles of responsible

        government and ensure smoother governance.
277. Shri. Brajeshwar Prasad was not in favor of the amendment that was put

        forth since he was of the opinion that the Governor should be vested not only

        with the power to act in his discretion but also with the power to act in his

        individual judgement. He was of the view that there was a dearth of

        leadership in the provinces wherein competent men were not available and

        unless the Governor is vested with large powers, it would be difficult to

        effect any improvement in the provincial administration. He went to the

        extent of saying that though such a procedure may be considered as

        undemocratic, it would be in the interest of the country. He remarked that,

        “I cannot allow democracy to jeopardize the vital interests of the country

        […] The masses who ought to be the rulers of this land are down-trodden

        and exploited in all ways. Under these circumstances there is no way left

        open but for the Government of India to take the Provincial administrations

        in its own hands”22. In his opinion, federalism could not succeed in a country

        which was passing through a transitory period and therefore, he subscribed

        to the view that power must be vested at the Centre and as a natural corollary,

        the Governor must be able to act in his discretion.
278. Shri. Mahavir Tyagi was also in agreement with the view that the Governor

        must be granted discretion. In his opinion, the State must be kept linked

        together with the Centre and the Governor would be the agent who guards

        the Central policy in the provinces/States. There would be certain subject-

        matters which affect the whole body politic and the provinces/States cannot

        be left free of the policy at the Centre. Since the policy which is evoked in

        the Centre must be followed by all the States, and if the Governors were to

        be in the hands of the provincial Ministers, then there will be various policies

        in various provinces and ministers of various types having different party

        labels and programmes would push their own agenda. Therefore, it was his

        view that, “The Governor being the agency of the Centre would be the only

        guarantee to integrate the various provinces/States”23. According to him,

        this is why the Governor’s discretionary powers should not be interfered

        with. He went on to remark that democratic trends are like a wild beast and

        that it goes by the whims and fancies of the parties and the masses. There

        must be some machinery which would keep this wild beast under control. It

        is in such a reality that the Governor exercising his discretion acts as a

        guardian of the Central policy on one side and the Constitution on the other.

W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 233 of 414
transcend party politics and he would look at the Minister and the State

government from a detached standpoint. He would also be able to influence

the ministers and members of the legislature in such a manner that the

administration would run smoothly. In such a circumstance, to say that he is

merely a dummy, an automaton or a dignitary without powers would be

gravely wrong. According to his conception of a constitutional Governor,

the Governor would have to accept the advice of his ministers in many

matters but there may also exist many other matters in which such an advice

will either be unavailable or wherein he will not be bound to accept that

advice. Another illustration, according to him, of when the Governor would

act in his discretion would be under draft
Article 147 (
Article 167
as it stands

today) where the Governor can exercise his power of calling for certain

information from the Chief Minister. Under this Article, the Governor is

competent to ask the Chief Minister to place any matter before the Council

of Ministers which only one minister might have decided. When he calls for

such information, he will be acting in the exercise of his discretion and may

call for any kind of information with a view to control and restrain the

ministry from undertaking irresponsible acts. Therefore, he remarked that,

“In my opinion taking the Governor as he is conceived to be under the
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 234 of 414
Constitution, he will exercise very important functions and therefore it is

        very necessary to retain the words relating to his discretion in article 143”25.
283. Shri. Rohini Kumar Chaudhuri put forth the alternate view that it is always

        better to be governed by the will of the people than to be governed by the

        will of a single person who could act in his discretion. He remarked that, “If

        this Governor is given the power to act in his discretion there is no power

        on earth to prevent him from doing so. He can be a veritable King Stork.”26.

        Furthermore, the draft
Article 143
itself states that wherever the Governor

        thinks that he is acting in his discretion, he cannot be questioned. According

        to him, in this day and age, we must not countenance such a state of affairs.
285. He conveyed that the Canadians and the Australians had not found it

        necessary to delete these provisions even in this day and age and that they

        were quite satisfied with its retention. This, he argued, was demonstrative of

        the fact that the grant of such a discretion to the Governor is fully compatible

        with a responsible government. If they had felt otherwise, they had the

        fullest right to abrogate this provision and would have done so. Therefore,

        the existence of a provision vesting a certain amount of discretion in the

        Governor cannot be questioned. Furthermore, the draft Article reads that,

        “Except in so far as he is by or under this Constitution” and not that “except

        wherever he thinks that he should exercise this power of discretion against

        the wishes or against the advice of the ministers”28. Therefore, the clause is

        very limited in nature and would have to be read in conjunction with such
27
8, CONSTITUENT ASSEMB. DEB., (Jun. 1, 1949) 500.
154. We declare the law of this branch of our Constitution to
        be that the President and Governor, custodians of all
        executive and other powers under various articles shall, by
        virtue of these provisions, exercise their formal constitutional
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 249 of 414
powers only upon and in accordance with the advice of their
        Ministers save in a few well-known exceptional situations.
        Without being dogmatic or exhaustive, these situations relate
        to (a) the choice of Prime Minister (Chief Minister),
        restricted though this choice is by the paramount
        consideration that he should command a majority in the
        House; (b) the dismissal of a Government which has lost its
        majority in the House, but refuses to quit office; (c) the
        dissolution of the House where an appeal to the country is
        necessitous, although in this area the head of State should
        avoid getting involved in politics and must be advised by his
        Prime Minister (Chief Minister) who will eventually take the
        responsibility for the step. We do not examine in detail the
        constitutional proprieties in these predicaments except to
        utter the caution that even here the action must be compelled
        by the peril to democracy and the appeal to the House or to
        the country must become blatantly obligatory. We have no
        doubt that de Smith's statement [ Constitutional and
        Administrative Law — by S.A. De Smith — Peguin Books on
        Foundations of Law] regarding royal assent holds good for
        the President and Governor in India:
32. If, on these facts and circumstances, the Governor cannot
        act in his own discretion there would be a complete
        breakdown of the rule of law inasmuch as it would then be
        open for Governments to refuse sanction in spite of
        overwhelming material showing that a prima facie case is
        made out. If, in cases where a prima facie case is clearly
        made out, sanction to prosecute high functionaries is refused
        or withheld, democracy itself will be at stake. It would then
        lead to a situation where people in power may break the law
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 254 of 414
with impunity safe in the knowledge that they will not be
             prosecuted as the requisite sanction will not be granted.”

                                               (Emphasis supplied)
149. In our considered view, a clear answer to the query
        raised above, can inter alia emerge from the Constituent
        Assembly Debates with reference to draft
Article 143
, which
        eventually came to be renumbered as
Article 163
in the
        Constitution. It would be relevant to record that from the
        queries raised by H.V. Kamath, T.T. Krishnamachari, Alladi
        Krishnaswami Ayyar, and from the response to the same by
        Dr B.R. Ambedkar, it clearly emerges that the general
        principle with reference to the scope and extent of the
        discretionary power of the Governor, is provided for through
Article 163(1).
It also becomes apparent from
Article 163(1)
,
        which provides for the principle of Ministerial Responsibility.
        The crucial position that gets clarified from a perusal of the
        Constituent Assembly Debates, arises from the answer to the
        query, whether the Governor should have any discretionary
        power at all? The Debates expound, that the retention of
        discretionary power with the Governor was not, in any way,
        contrary to the power of responsible Government, nor should
        the same be assumed as a power akin to that vested with a
        Governor under the
Government of India Act, 1935
. And from
        that, emerges the answer that the retention and vesting of
        discretionary powers with the Governor, should not be taken
        in the sense of being contrary to, or having the effect of
        negating the powers of responsible Government.
Clause (2) of
Article 254
obviates that consequence where
        the law has been reserved for the consideration of the
        President and has received assent.
Article 254(1)
is made
        subject to clause (2), thereby emphasising that the assent of
        the President will cure a repugnancy of the State law with a
        law enacted by Parliament in a matter falling in the
        Concurrent List. It is in this context, that the decisions of this
        Court hold that the assent of the President should be sought
        in relation to a repugnancy with a specific provision
        contained in a Parliamentary legislation so as to enable due
        consideration by the President of the ground on which assent
        has been sought.
Article 200
contains the source of the
        constitutional power which is conferred upon the Governor
        to reserve a Bill for the consideration of the President.
Article
        254(2)
is an illustration of the constitutional authority of the
        Governor to reserve a law enacted by the State Legislature
        for consideration of the President in a specified situation —
        where it is repugnant to an existing law or to a Parliamentary
        legislation on a matter falling in the Concurrent List. The
        eventuality which is specified in
Article 254(2)
does not
        exhaust the ambit of the power entrusted to the Governor
        under
Article 200
to reserve a Bill for the consideration of
        the President. Apart from a repugnancy in matters falling in
        the Concurrent List between State and Parliamentary
        legislation, a Governor may have sound constitutional
        reasons to reserve a Bill for the consideration of the
        President.
Article 200
, in its second proviso mandates that a
        Bill which derogates from the powers of the High Court must
        be reserved for the consideration of the President. Apart from
        Bills which fall within the description set out in the second
        proviso, the Governor may legitimately refer a Bill for
        consideration of the President upon entertaining a legitimate
        doubt about the validity of the law. By its very nature, it
        would not be possible for this Court to reflect upon the
        situations in which the power under
Article 200
can be
        exercised. This was noticed in the judgment of this Court
        in
Hoechst [Hoechst Pharmaceuticals Ltd. v. State of Bihar
,
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                         Page 266 of 414
(1983) 4 SCC 45 : 1983 SCC (Tax) 248] . Excluding it from
            judicial scrutiny, the Court held : (SCC pp. 100-101, para 86)

                 ‘86. [...] There may also be a Bill passed by the
                 State Legislature where there may be a genuine
                 doubt about the applicability of any of the
                 provisions of the Constitution which require the
                 assent of the President to be given to it in order that
                 it may be effective as an Act. In such a case, it is
                 for the Governor to exercise his discretion and to
                 decide whether he should assent to the Bill or
                 should reserve it for consideration of the President
                 to avoid any future complication. Even if it
                 ultimately turns out that there was no necessity for
                 the Governor to have reserved a Bill for the
                 consideration of the President, still he having done
                 so and obtained the assent of the President, the Act
                 so passed cannot be held to be unconstitutional on
                 the ground of want of proper assent. This aspect of
                 the matter, as the law now stands, is not open to
                 scrutiny by the courts. In the instant case, the
                 Finance Bill which ultimately became the Act in
                 question was a consolidating Act relating to
                 different subjects and perhaps the Governor felt
                 that it was necessary to reserve it for the assent of
                 the President. We have no hesitation in holding
                 that the assent of the President is not justiciable,
                 and we cannot spell out any infirmity arising out of
                 his decision to give such assent.’”

said to be present only in those cases where the Constitution has envisaged

a mandatory approval of the Government, before the law can become

enforceable in the State. The Sarkaria Commission mentioned three

categories where reservation of a bill for the consideration of the President

is envisaged:
This means that the Governor is made well aware of any legislation that the

     State government is planning to enact much before it is introduced in the

     State legislature and sent to him for assent. Thus, the advisory role of the

     Governor is best played by engaging with the Council of Ministers even

     before the legislation is introduced in the State legislature. He is well within

     his rights, and in fact, it is his bounden duty to put to use his experience and

     wisdom by making constructive suggestions to the Cabinet regarding the

     legislative proposals. The Council of Ministers would also do good to take

     into consideration the advice of the Governor and deliberate upon it so that

     the legislation and ultimately, public interest is benefitted.
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 271 of 414
310. As our discussion on the Constituent Assembly debates also reveals, the

    option of withholding of assent, was believed by the framers, would be

    invoked in very rare circumstances where the Council of Ministers discover

    some error in the legislation or desire to incorporate certain changes to it so

    as to meet with the popular opinion outside the House. The framers did not

    expect that the Governor would, as a matter of routine, declare the

    withholding of assent to bills casually. The deletion of the expression “in his

    discretion” from the first proviso is also an unmistakable indication of the

    intent of the framers in vesting no discretion in the Governor as regards the

    withholding of assent and returning of the bill along with suggestions for the

    introduction of amendments.
317. The Governor under the constitutional scheme is no longer envisaged as the

    Governor under the GoI Act, 1935, having the ultimate power to veto any

    legislation and subvert the collective will of the people being expressed

    through the legislature. If the power to withhold assent to bills or to reserve

    them for the consideration of the President is construed as falling within the

    exclusive discretionary domain of the Governor, who would be free to

    decide a course of action notwithstanding the aid and advice of the Council

    of Ministers, it would have the potential of turning him into a super-

    constitutional figure, having the power to bring to a complete halt, the

    operation of the legislative machinery in the State. The Governor cannot be

    vested with such a power, the exercise of which would enable him to collude

    with the Union Cabinet and ensure the death of any and all legislation

    initiated by the State merely by reserving it for the consideration of the

    President, who under
Article 201
is not bound to give assent to any

    legislation reserved for his consideration.
324. Essentially, the questions that fall for our consideration are as follows:
332. From the above exposition of law, it becomes clear as a noon day, that no

    exercise of power under the Constitution is beyond the pale of judicial

    review. Thus, we find no reason to exclude the discharge of functions by the

    Governor or the President under
Articles 200
and
201
of the Constitution

    respectively.
When public interest requires, this Court has to do its
            constitutional duties and to address the situation. However,
            this Court is of the opinion that such a situation would not
            arise to pass any order in this matter.”
                                             (Emphasis supplied)
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 296 of 414
348. We find it difficult to express our agreement with the view taken in
B.K.

    Pavitra
(supra) that the exercise of power to reserve a bill for the

    consideration of the President by the Governor is beyond the pale of judicial

    scrutiny, even in cases where it is exercised in his own discretion and against
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 311 of 414
the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers. We have discussed in the

previous sections of this judgment that the Governor under
Article 200
is

ordinarily expected to act in accordance with the aid and advice of the

Council of Ministers, and it is only in certain very exceptional situations that

he should resort to the exercise of discretion. Further, the limits of such

discretion are to be derived from
Article 163(1).
The exercise of such

discretion by the Governor, if excluded from judicial scrutiny, would

militate against the fundamental constitutional principle that exercise of all

power must be within the confines of the Constitution. Absolute exclusion

of judicial scrutiny would also confer upon the Governor an absolute power

to disregard the will of the people expressed through the State legislature

and government. While it is true that there may be situations in which the

exercise of discretion by the Governor under
Article 200
would be

permissible, this does not imply that this Court would be precluded from

determining the legality and propriety of the exercise of such discretion in a

given case. In fact, it is owing to the impossibility of the task of exhaustively

charting out such situations wherein discretion would be allowed to be

exercised, that it becomes all the more crucial for the power of judicial

review to exist with the courts. This would keep in line any bonafide action

on the part of the Governor which is disguised under the garb of legitimate

exercise of discretion.
349. The two-fold observations in
B.K. Pavitra
(supra) vesting the Governor with

     unfettered discretion to reserve bills for the consideration of the President

     under
Article 200
, and at the same time excluding such exercise of discretion

     from judicial scrutiny essentially has the effect of safeguarding the actions

     of the Governor in a lead casket which cannot be permeated even in cases

     of breach of the constitutional framework within which the Governor is

     expected to function.
77. The assent of the President or the Governor, as the case
        may be, is considered to be part of the legislative process only
        for the limited purpose that the legislative process is
        incomplete without them for enacting a law and in the
        absence of the assent the Bill passed could not be considered
        to be an Act or a piece of legislation, effective and
        enforceable and not to extend the immunity in respect of
        procedural formalities to be observed inside the respective
        Houses and certification by the presiding officer concerned
        of their due compliance, to areas or acts outside and besides
        those formalities. The powers actually exercised by the
        President, at any rate under
Articles 31-A
, 31-C
, 254(2)
and
304(b)
are a special constituent power vested with the Head
        of the Union, as the protector and defender of the
        Constitution and safety valve to safeguard the fundamental
        rights of citizens and federal structure of the country's polity
        as adopted in the Constitution. A genuine, real and effective
        consideration would depend upon specific and sufficient
        information being provided to him inviting, at any rate, his
        attention to the Central law with which the State law is
        considered or apprehended to be repugnant, and in the
        absence of any effort or exercise shown to have been
        undertaken, when questioned before courts, the State law
        cannot be permitted or allowed to have predominance or an
        overriding effect over that Central enactment of Parliament
        to which no specific reference of the President at all has been
        invited to. This, in my view, is a must and an essential
        requirement to be satisfied; in the absence of which the
        “consideration” claimed would be one in a vacuum and
        really oblivious to the hoard of legislations falling under the
        Concurrent List in force in the country and enacted by
        Parliament. To uphold as valid the claim for any such blanket
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 323 of 414
assent or all-round predominance over any and every such
             law — whether brought to the notice of the President or not,
             would amount to legitimization of what was not even in the
             contemplation or consideration on the basis of some assumed
             “consideration”. In order to find out the real state of affairs
             as to whether the “assent” in a given case was after a due
             and proper application of mind and effective
             “consideration” as envisaged by the Constitution, this Court
             as well as the High Court exercising powers of judicial
             review are entitled to call for the relevant records and look
             into the same. This the courts have been doing, as and when
             considered necessary, all along. No exception therefore
             could be taken to the High Court in this case adopting such a
             procedure, in discharge of its obligations and exercise of
             jurisdiction under the Constitution of India.”

                                              (Emphasis supplied)
357. We have given some thought to the observations made in the aforesaid

     decisions as regards the non-justiciability of the assent of the President. As

     per the settled principles of parliamentary democracy across the world, the

     grant of assent to legislations is construed as a power of the head of state

     which is to be exercised only upon the aid and advice of the Council of

     Ministers. As per
Articles 74(2)
and
163(3)
of the Constitution respectively,

     the question whether any, and if so what, advice was tendered by the

     Ministers to the President or the Governor, shall not be inquired into by any

     court. A perusal of
Articles 111
, 200
and
201
respectively makes it clear that

     no reasons are required to be provided by the President or the Governor for

     according assent to bills. However, if the President or the Governor exercise

     the option of withholding of assent under
Article 111
or 200 respectively,

     then there is a requirement to communicate the reasons for such withholding

     in the form of a message to the House or Houses of the legislature. Similarly,
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 326 of 414
as has been discussed with great emphasis in Kaiser-I-Hind (supra), if there

     is any reservation of Bills for the consideration of the President by the

     Governor, then the same must be reflected by way of a specific and clear

     reference providing details as to why the reservation has been made so as to

     enable the President to “consider” the desirability of according assent to the

     bill so reserved.
358. The grant of assent to a bill is an exercise which generally takes place on the

     aid and advice of the Council of Ministers, and assenting to the bill is the

     only practically possible course of action available to the constitutional

     heads in most of the common law jurisdictions. The grant of assent may not

     be justiciable because, there exists an unavailability of any material upon

     which the courts may be able to undertake a judicial scrutiny. However, the

     same would not be the case as regards the withholding of assent or

     reservation of the bill for the consideration of the President, which can only

     be exercised upon furnishing of detailed reasons for the same.
362. As described in Kaiser-I-Hind (supra), the role of the President under
Article 201
is a sui-generis one, tailor made to fit the quasi-federal

    constitutional scheme. The role of the Governor in reserving bills for the

    consideration of the President is also intrinsically linked with this constituent

    role of the President. It was also observed that the grant of assent is

    considered a legislative act only for the limited purpose that without it a bill

    cannot become law and also for extending immunity to certain formalities

    to be followed within the legislature. This immunity does not extend to other

    aspects of the legal procedure which fall beyond the ambit of these limited

    formalities. Thus, compliance with the prescribed legislative procedure

    leading up to assent is open to judicial scrutiny in appropriate cases. Further,

    as we have discussed in the preceding paragraphs, the reservation of bills for

    the consideration of the President by the Governor is warranted only in

    certain limited situations.
200. Our discussion on the scope of discretion available to the Governor
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                     Page 330 of 414
makes it clear that the Governor exercises discretion in a very limited

    domain when discharging his functions under
Article 200.
He may reserve

    the bills for the consideration of the President only for achieving certain

    predetermined purposes and his personal views, disliking for the policy, or

    the views of the Union government are not grounds on which he may reserve

    a bill under
Article 200.
The nature of constitutional function prescribed for

    the Governor under
Article 200
being such, the exercise of such function

    can be subjected to judicial review on the standard of being within

    constitutional bounds. Reserving a bill for the consideration of the President

    is a part of the legislative procedure and must invariably be subjected to

    judicial review in cases where the constitutionally prescribed procedure is

    not complied with, or misused.
366. As a logical sequitur of the above, any exercise of
Article 201
in a manner

     which does not align with this fundamental object underlying
Article 201
would be liable to a greater degree of judicial scrutiny. Thus, wherever a bill

     which falls within the exclusive domain of the State legislature is being

     referred to the President for his consideration on the ground that it attracts

     one of the exceptional situations where the Governor may exercise his

     discretion as mentioned in paragraph 300 of this judgment, it would not be

     open to the President to withhold assent without ascribing reasons as regards

     the doubt raised by the Governor to such a bill. In such a case, the ideal

     course for the President would be to obtain legal opinion as regards the bill,

     in appropriate cases, by making reference to this Court under
Article 143
,

     and only thereafter declare the grant or withholding of assent. Where the

     grounds of withholding of assent are not concerned with policy areas in

     which the Union has primacy, the courts would have a greater degree of
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 332 of 414
judicial scrutiny. We say this because on questions of legality, it is the

    constitutional courts which have been conferred with the power of arriving

    at a final decision and the object of
Article 201
is not to thwart the legislative

    procedure of the States by withholding of assent even in areas falling within

    the exclusive domain of the States on grounds of legality.
(iii)    Where the reservation of a bill by the Governor for the

             consideration of the President is on the grounds of peril to

             democracy or democratic principles or on other exceptional

             grounds as mentioned in M.P. Special Police (supra) and

             Nabam Rebia (supra) then the Governor would be expected to
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 335 of 414
make a specific and clear reference to the President properly

             indicating the reasons for entertaining such a belief by

             pinpointing the specific provisions in this regard and the

             consequent effect that may ensue if such a bill were to be

             allowed to become a law. The Governor while making such a

             reference should also indicate his subjective satisfaction as to

             why the aforesaid consequences that may ensue cannot be

             possibly curtailed or contained by taking recourse to the

             constitutional courts of the country. It shall be open to the State

             Government to challenge such a reservation on the ground of

             failure on part of the Governor to furnish the necessary reasons

             as discussed aforesaid or that the reasons indicated are wholly

             irrelevant, mala-fide, arbitrary, unnecessary or motivated by

             extraneous considerations. This being a question completely

             capable of being determined by the constitutional courts, would

             be fully justiciable.
(iv)     Reservation of a bill on grounds other than the ones mentioned

             above, such as personal dissatisfaction of the Governor,

             political expediency or any other extraneous or irrelevant

             considerations is strictly impermissible by the Constitution and

             would be liable to be set-aside forthwith on that ground alone.
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 336 of 414
This will also encompass reservation of a bill by the Governor

                after having already exercised the option of withholding of

                assent in terms of
Article 200
except in such exceptional

                circumstance as mentioned in paragraph 204 of this judgment.
(v)         Where the Governor exhibits inaction in making a decision

                when a bill is presented to him for assent under
Article 200
and

                such inaction exceeds the time-limit as has been prescribed by

                us in paragraph 250 of this judgment then it shall be open to the

                State Government to seek a writ of mandamus from a

                competent court against the Governor directing expeditious

                decision on the concerned bill as is the mandate of the

                Constitution, however, it is clarified that the Governor may

                successfully resist such a challenge on providing sufficient

                explanation for the delay caused.
369. We clarify that the possible situations illustrated by above are not meant to

      be exhaustive and in the specific facts of a given case, the courts may evolve

      new standards of judicial scrutiny to ensure that the constitutionally

      prescribed procedure is adhered to in letter and spirit.



vi.    What is the manner in which the President under
Article 201
of the
       Constitution is required to act once a Bill has been reserved for his
       consideration by the Governor under
Article 200
of the Constitution?
375. Any symptoms of lethargy exhibited by the State legislature which is the

    recipient of a bill sent after the procedure under
Article 201
is adopted, is

    viewed strictly by the Constitution. Here, inaction by the State legislature or

    delayed action by them in terms of repassing of the bill would cause the bill

    to “fall through” instead. The consequences of the failure to act promptly

    and in a punctual manner is more grave and severe for the State legislature

    under
Article 201
since the premise is that the occasion for the reservation

    of a bill for the consideration of the President by the Governor may arise

    where a constitutional provision makes the assent of the President a

    condition precedent to a State legislation becoming enforceable or for the

    purpose of conferring some immunity upon the State legislation. Such a

    requirement can be found in
Articles 31A
, 31C
, 254(2)
, 288(2)
, 360(4)(a)(ii)
etc. The second proviso to
Article 200
also makes reservation for the

    consideration of the President mandatory. As we have also discussed, there

    may be certain other legitimate situations where the Governor may, in
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 344 of 414
exercise of his discretion, reserve a bill for the consideration of the

    President. The matters attracting the aforesaid provisions require the

    procedure in
Article 201
to be initiated since they pertain to areas wherein

    the Centre could be said to have precedence or an edge over the State

    governments. This is because the considerations herein involve questions

    pertaining to the larger economic policy of the Union, safeguarding the

    fundamental rights of citizens and maintaining the integrity of the country

    as a whole. For example, the uniformity of policy across States for matters

    falling under the Concurrent List would be a valid arena wherein the interest

    of the Union might need to be paid heed to in comparison with those of the

    States. Hence, a higher degree of the power of scrutiny of the President

    would be implicit in such matters and he, having consulted the Union

    Council of Ministers, could be said to have the final say which has the effect

    of overriding those wishes of the State legislature.
378. It is in such a background and context that the prescription of the six-month

         time limit upon the State legislature for re-passing the Bill and presenting it

         before the President for his consideration assumes more significance. Non-

         adherence or any absence of deference to this time-limit would prove to be

         detrimental to the cause of the State itself since the balance of power is

         inherently skewed in favour of the Union on such matters. Having said so,

         and also conscientiously discussed by us in the preceding paragraphs, this is

         why the reference by the Governor of bills for the consideration of the

         President must be strictly by and under the strength of clear provisions of

         the Constitution.
Owing to this, a number of bills enacted by the legislatures of various

         States remain pending with the President awaiting a decision.

      b. There being no obligation upon the President to mandatorily assent to a

         bill under
Article 201
, if a bill is reserved for the consideration of the

         President by the Governor acting in his discretion, then it has the effect

         of rendering the enactment of the bill by the State legislature nugatory,

         if the President keeps the bill pending with him or declares the

         withholding of assent to such a bill.
385. At this juncture, we deem it apposite to refer to the office memorandum

     issued by the Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India dated

     04.02.2016 to all the Ministries/Departments of the Government of India

     regarding the expeditious disposal of State bills reserved for the assent of

     the President. The same is reproduced hereinbelow:
386. The aforesaid memorandum indicates that the procedure involved after a

    reference is made to the President by the Governor is that the Union Ministry

    of Home Affairs as the nodal Ministry would refer the substantive issues

    involved in the bill to the appropriate Ministry at the Centre which is

    concerned with the subject matter and issues pertaining to the bill’s

    language, drafting or constitutional validity to the Law Ministry at the

    Centre. In this process, the Office Memorandum lays down strict guidelines

    directing the concerned Central Departments or Ministries that the

    objections or views that they may have to the bill must be meaningful and
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 353 of 414
precise. Such a stipulation has been laid down because the making of

    unreasonable queries or observations only serves to delay the entire process

    of consideration of a bill by the President under
Article 201.
The Ministry

    concerned with the substantive issues as regards the bill is required to

    communicate their views to the Home Ministry within 15 days from the date

    of receipt of the bill. If there is a deviation from the said time restriction,

    they must assign reasons for the delay that has ensued on their part. The

    failure to indicate so within a maximum period of one month, is construed

    strictly and understood to mean that the concerned Ministry may have no

    comments whatsoever to offer on the proposal. A perusal of the aforesaid

    also makes it clear that a timeline of three months has been prescribed for

    the decision on bills reserved for the President. A time limit of three weeks

    has been prescribed for the disposal of ordinances of an urgent nature.
398. The mandate for an effective and purposeful dialogue has been

    constitutionally recognised and approved through the proviso to
Article 201.
Making the exercise of this proviso optional or subjecting it to the discretion

    of the President to use wherever and whenever he deems fit would deprive

    the States of an important safeguard which has been clearly
laid down in
the

    Constitution. Although we are not oblivious to the fact that the Office

    Memorandums referred by us above provide an opportunity for the State
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 363 of 414
government to respond to the objections that the concerned Ministry at the

    Centre may have, we must remember that such an Office Memorandum

    cannot be used to bypass a procedure already
laid down in
the text of the

    Constitution. Furthermore, the sending of objections and receipt of

    clarifications to and from the State government while the proposed bill is

    under consideration of the President through the concerned Ministry at the

    Centre, is to enable and infuse an informed decision making in the entire

    process to avoid any haste or non-application of mind, before taking any

    decision of either grant of assent or withholding thereof in the first place.
405. However, if he chooses to withhold his assent, the bill will not take birth as

     law. It must, however, be noted that even during the withholding of assent

     of a bill received on the second round, the President would be required to

     assign clear and sufficiently detailed reasons for arriving at such a decision.
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 367 of 414
Even in the second round, he has no power whatsoever to exercise absolute

    veto, as the Constitution does not provide anywhere that withholding of

    assent can be done simpliciter. Hence, the decision to choose the option of

    withholding assent after having set into motion the proviso to
Article 201
must not be misconstrued to mean that he is exercising an ‘absolute veto’ or

    a power of a similar nature. We say so because first, the decision has not

    been arrived at in the first instance without communicating reasons to the

    State legislature and providing them with an opportunity to reconsider the

    bill, and secondly, the President is mandated to declare the withholding of

    assent to the repassed bill with cogent and sufficient reasons at this stage as

    well.
5.10.04
Articles 31A(1)
, 31C
, 288(2)
and
304(b)
provide for
        reservation of certain types of State Bills for the
        consideration and assent of the President. These provisions,
        read with Article 201—, enable the Union Executive to
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                         Page 369 of 414
ensure, on the basic aspects of these special matters, a
        certain degree of uniformity in the interests of the social and
        economic unity of the country. Examination of the State Bills
        of this special category, from the point of their compatibility
        with the settled policy of the Union, therefore, does not
        involve any impropriety.
President should not withhold assent merely on
        consideration of policy differences with respect to matters
        in List II


        5.10.05 Apart from all such matters on which a measure of
        uniform coordinated policy is desirable, there remains in List
        II an area which is purely of local or domestic concern to the
        States. It is with respect to Bills falling within this area of
        exclusive State concern that utmost caution, circumspection
        and restraint on the part of the Union Executive is required
        in the exercise of its supervisory powers under Article 201—
        . This is all the more necessary if the Bill has been reserved
        by the Governor in the exercise of his discretion, contrary to
        the advice of his Ministers. It may not be prudent to veto such
        a Bill merely on the ground that the legislative policy of the
        Bill, though otherwise constitutional, does not conform with
        what the Union Government thinks should be its policy with
        respect to the subject-matter of the Bill.
407. Where the ground of reservation of a bill is patent unconstitutionality of a

     nature described in the exceptional situations in M.P. Special Police (supra),

     that is where the bill upon becoming law would be a peril to democracy, the

     decision of the President must be guided by the fact that it is the

     constitutional courts that have been conferred with the ultimate authority of

     interpretation of the Constitution and the laws.
408. When a legislation is apprehended to be patently unconstitutional of the

     nature described in the above paragraph, the courts as the sentinel on qui

     vive have been empowered by the Constitution to test the vires of such

     legislation and there is no bar or limitation to the power of judicial review

     of the courts in this regard. This is in consonance with the constitutional

     scheme of checks and balances between the three wings of the Government

     so as to ensure that absolute power does not vest in one authority. Therefore,

     the power of judicial review by design acts as more than a sufficient

     safeguard against the enactment of an unconstitutional legislation by the

     legislature.
409. However, in cases of challenge to legislations duly passed by the legislature

     and assented to by the executive, the constitutional courts temper their

     judicial review with the presumption that such legislation is constitutional.

     This is because the courts deem it appropriate to not interfere with an
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 371 of 414
enactment that has been passed in the wisdom of the legislature and

     symbolises the political will of our people. It is in this context, that we find

     it worthwhile to note the remarks of the eminent constitutional jurist, Nani

     Palkhivala on the object of assent by the executive to a bill – “The object of

     enacting these provisions [
Articles 200
and
201]
was perhaps that while the

     constitutionality of a law can be challenged in a court, its wisdom cannot be

     and that it would be better to prevent a clearly unconstitutional legislation

     from becoming law than to have it invalidated by a court later.” However,

     the aforesaid statement should not be construed devoid of its context, more

     particularly in ignorance of
Article 143
of the Constitution which we shall

     now discuss.
410. We are in agreement that one of the object of
Article 201
is also to prevent

     a bill that is perilous to democratic principles. However, we are also of the

     view that a bill appearing to be unconstitutional must be assessed by a

     judicial mind. It is for this reason that both the Sarkaria Commission and the

     Punchhi Commission categorically recommended the President to seek the

     opinion of this Court under
Article 143
in respect of bills that may be

     apprehended to be patently unconstitutional.
411.
Article 143
confers on the President the power to consult this Court any time

     when it appears to the President that a question of law or fact has arisen, or
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 372 of 414
is likely to arise, which is of such a nature and of such public importance

     that it is expedient to obtain the opinion of this Court upon it. Therefore, the

     President is not just precluded but constitutionally expected to refer the

     question of vires of a bill to this Court as the apex judicial institution to

     ascertain the constitutionality thereof and accordingly enable the President

     to take action in respect of the said bill under
Article 201.
412. We are of the considered view that although the option to refer a bill to this

     Court under
Article 143
may not be mandatory, yet the President, as a

     measure of prudence, ought to seek an opinion under the said provision in

     respect of bills that have been reserved for the consideration of the President

     on grounds of perceived unconstitutionality. This is all the more necessary

     as there is no mechanism at the State level for the Governor to refer bills to

     the constitutional courts for their advice or opinion thereupon. Under the

     scheme of the Constitution as we see it, there is only one possible way for

     the Governor to ascertain the palpable constitutionality of a bill, which is by

     way of reserving it for the consideration of the President who in turn is then

     expected to invoke
Article 143.
The Constitution is not a maze, but a

     labyrinth. Although both may semantically appear to be one and the same,

     yet there is a very fine but discernible difference between the two. The

     difference lies in the fact that in a maze one may lose their way within the

     multiple overlapping paths, with the possibility of each of them leading to a
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 373 of 414
dead-end, however in a labyrinth one eventually finds the way and in the

    process also come out more enlightened. Similarly, any questions emanating

    from the Constitution or pertaining thereto such as the constitutional vires

    of a law must be uncovered through the foresightedness of our Constitution.

    Wherever, a bill is reserved by the Governor for the President on the ground

    of patent unconstitutionality of the nature wherein the exercise of discretion

    by the Governor is permissible under
Article 163(1)
, the Constitution

    expects the President to be the soothsayer, easing the sails for the Governor.
413. This very same constitutional obligation cast on the President is also

    provided in Article 154H of the Constitution of Sri Lanka wherein if the

    Governor is of the opinion that a statute enacted by a provincial council is

    unconstitutional, then he may refer the bill to the President who in turn is

    obligated to make a reference to the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka for

    obtaining pronouncement on the constitutional vires of such bill. Where the

    Supreme Court holds the statute to be constitutional, then the Governor is

    bound to grant assent. A similar framework is followed in the Republic of

    Kiribati where Section 66 of the Constitution of Kiribati allows the

    Beretitenti, who is the constitutional head of the State, to withhold assent to

    a bill only if he believes that such bill is inconsistent with the constitution.

    In such a case, he may return the bill back to the Parliament however, if the

    bill is passed again then the only option left with the Beretitenti is to either
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 374 of 414
assent or to refer its vires to the High Court for a declaration. If the court

    declares the bill to be constitutional then the assent must be granted

    forthwith.
417. It is in such situations that the court has to be mindful as to whether the

     reference received from the President under
Article 143
pertains to pure

     legal questions regarding interpretation of the Constitution or questions that

     are in the nature of a policy consideration. In case of the latter, the Supreme

     Court, having regard to the relevant facts and circumstances, can refuse to

     express its advisory opinion upon being satisfied that the questions presented

     to it are purely socio-economic or political questions and have no relation to

     the Constitution.
422. A lack of reasons or even insufficiency thereof may do violence to the

     concept of ‘limited government’ on which the edifice of our Constitution

     has been built. The whys and wherefores of the President’s actions provide

     a basis for judicial review and allow the courts to assess the validity of the

     decision as well as ensure accountability between the three pillars of

     government which is in consonance with the idea of checks and balances in

     the constitutional set-up of our country.
423. In this context, we are of the considered view that the expression of intention

     by the President through a declaration of reasons supporting his actions

     under
Article 201
is of paramount importance and this Court is not inhibited

     in any manner to make a presumption that the President and by extension,

     the Central government, may not have acted in a bona fide manner at the

     time when it exercises its powers of judicial review.
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 380 of 414
430. Coming to the facts of the present case, the Governor first withheld the ten

     bills under question and later despite the said Bills being repassed by the

     State legislature and presented before him again under the first proviso to
Article 200
, still reserved them for the consideration of the President. We

     have elaborated in detail that owing to the clear language in which the first

     proviso is couched, there would never arise, except in extraordinary

     situations, any occasion for the Governor to reserve a reconsidered bill for

     the consideration of the President. The said bills, in the absence of any

     message given by the Governor under the first proviso, were taken up for

     reconsideration by the State Assembly and passed in their original form, and

     presented to the Governor for his assent. Thus, undoubtedly, it was not open

     to the Governor to reserve the bills for the consideration of the President and

     he ought to have granted assent.
431. Considerable time has elapsed since these ten Bills were originally passed

     and presented to the Governor for assent. Two out of the ten Bills even date

     back to 2020. It is important to keep in mind that the tenure of the State

     legislature is of five years and the representatives are accountable to their

     electorate as regards the enactment of legislations addressing the issues

     faced by the electorate. At the end of every five years, the elected

     representatives have to go back to their electorate and provide a report card,

     based upon which the people, in whom the ultimate sovereignty rests, cast

     their votes. Bills, if kept pending for long despite their passage by the State

     legislature, militate against this very fundamental, essential to the

     sustenance of a representative democracy based on direct elections.
432. The conduct exhibited on part of the Governor, as it clearly appears from the

     events that have transpired even during the course of the present litigation,

     has been lacking in bonafides. There have been clear instances where the

     Governor has failed in showing due deference and respect to the judgments

     and directions of this Court. In such a situation, it is difficult for us to repose

     our trust and remand the matter to the Governor with a direction to dispose

     of the bills in accordance with the observations made by us in this judgment.
Article 142
empowers this Court to do complete justice and in the facts of

     the present case, more particularly, in light of the fact that the option of

     granting assent to the repassed bills was the only constitutionally permissible
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                          Page 385 of 414
option available with the Governor, we deem it absolutely necessary and

     appropriate to grant that very relief by exercising our extraordinary powers.

     No meaningful purpose would be served by keeping the bills, some of which

     have already been pending for incredulously long periods, pending for more

     time. Therefore, we deem the assent to have been granted.
433. Constitutional authorities are creatures of the Constitution and are bound by

     the limitations prescribed by it. No authority, in exercise of its powers, or to

     put it precisely, in discharge of its duties, must attempt to breach the

     constitutional firewall. The office of the Governor is no exception to this

     supreme command. Whenever there is an attempt by any authority to move

     beyond the bounds of the Constitution, this Court has been entrusted with

     the responsibility to act as the Sentinel on the qui vive and bring back the

     authority within the constitutionally permissible limits by exercising judicial

     review. We are not exercising our power under
Article 142
in a casual

     manner, or without giving a thought to it. On the contrary, it is only after

     deepest of deliberations, and having reached at the firm conclusion that the

     actions of the Governor - first in exhibiting prolonged inaction over the bills;

     secondly in declaring a simplicter withholding of assent and returning the

     bills without a message; and thirdly in reserving the bills for the President

     in the second round - were all in clear violation of the procedure envisaged

     under the Constitution, that we have decided to declare the deeming of
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 386 of 414
assent to the ten bills, considering it to be our constitutionally bounden duty.
(XX)     Whenever, in exercise of the powers under
Article 200
of the

         Constitution, a bill is reserved for the consideration of the President

         on grounds of patent unconstitutionality that are of such a nature so

         as to cause peril to the principles of representative democracy, the

         President, must be guided by the fact that it is the constitutional
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 399 of 414
courts which have been entrusted with the responsibility of

         adjudicating upon the questions of constitutionality and legality of

         an executive or legislative action. Therefore, as a measure of

         prudence, the President ought to make a reference to this Court in

         exercise of his powers under
Article 143
of the Constitution.



(XXI)    Judicial review and justiciability are not synonymous concepts. The

         power of judicial review in a written constitution is implicit. Unless

         expressly excluded by a provision of the Constitution, the power of

         judicial review is available in respect of exercise of powers under

         any of the provisions of the Constitution. On the other hand,

         justiciability relates to a particular field falling within the purview

         of the power of judicial review.
(iii)    Where the reservation of a bill by the Governor for the

                     consideration of the President is on the grounds of peril

                     to democracy or democratic principles or on other

                     exceptional grounds as mentioned in M.P. Special

                     Police (supra) and Nabam Rebia (supra) then the

                     Governor would be expected to make a specific and

                     clear reference to the President properly indicating the

                     reasons for entertaining such a belief by pinpointing the
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 404 of 414
specific provisions in this regard and the consequent

                     effect that may ensue if such a bill were to be allowed

                     to become a law. The Governor while making such a

                     reference should also indicate his subjective satisfaction

                     as to why the aforesaid consequences that may ensue

                     cannot be possibly curtailed or contained by taking

                     recourse to the constitutional courts of the country. It

                     shall be open to the State Government to challenge such

                     a reservation on the ground of failure on part of the

                     Governor to furnish the necessary reasons as discussed

                     aforesaid or that the reasons indicated are wholly

                     irrelevant,   mala-fide,   arbitrary,   unnecessary    or

                     motivated by extraneous considerations. This being a

                     question completely capable of being determined by the

                     constitutional courts, would be fully justiciable.
(iv)     Reservation of a bill on grounds other than the ones

                     mentioned above, such as personal dissatisfaction of the

                     Governor, political expediency or any other extraneous

                     or irrelevant considerations is strictly impermissible by

                     the Constitution and would be liable to be set-aside

                     forthwith on that ground alone. This will also
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 405 of 414
encompass reservation of a bill by the Governor after

                     having already exercised the option of withholding of

                     assent in terms of
Article 200
except in such exceptional

                     circumstance as mentioned in paragraph 204 of this

                     judgment.
437. The Governor before he assumes office undertakes an oath to discharge his

    functions to the best of his ability in order to preserve, protect and defend

    the Constitution and the rule of law, along with avowing to devote himself

    to the service and well-being of the people of the State. Therefore, it is

    imperative that all his actions be guided in true allegiance to his oath and

    that he faithfully executes his functions that he is entrusted with by and under

    the Constitution. There is a reason why a specific reference is made to the

    well-being of the people of the State in his oath, there is a reason why he is

    sworn in to pledge himself to the service of the same people; the Governor

    as the constitutional head of the State is reposed with the responsibility to

    accord primacy to the will and welfare of the people of the State and

    earnestly work in harmony with the State machinery, as his oath not only

    makes this mandate anything but clear but rather also demands it of the

    Governor owing to the intimate and delicate nature of the functions that he

    performs and the potency of the ramifications that could ensue or be

    unleashed upon the State. Due to this, the Governor must be conscious to

    not create roadblocks or chokehold the State Legislature in order to thwart

    and trade the will of the people for political edge. The members of the State

    Legislature having been elected by the people of the State as an outcome of

    the democratic expression are better attuned to ensure the wellbeing of the

    people of the State. Hence, any action contrary to the express choice of the
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 410 of 414
people, in other words, the State legislature would be a renege of his

    constitutional oath.
438. Before we part with the matter, we find it apposite to observe that

    constitutional authorities occupying high offices must be guided by the

    values of the Constitution. These values that are so cherished by the people

    of India are a result of years of struggle and sacrifice of our forefathers.

    When called upon to take decisions, such authorities must not give in to

    ephemeral political considerations but rather be guided by the spirit that

    underlies the Constitution. They must look within and reflect whether their

    actions are informed by their constitutional oath and if the course of action

    adopted by them furthers the ideals enshrined in the Constitution. If the

    authorities attempt to deliberately bypass the constitutional mandate, they

    are tinkering with the very ideals revered by its people upon which this

    country has been built.
439. We take this opportunity to quote Dr. B.R. Ambedkar’s concluding speech

    in the Constituent Assembly, which is as relevant today as it was in 1949 –

    “However good a Constitution may be, it is sure to turn out bad because

    those who are called to work it, happen to be a bad lot. However bad a

    Constitution may be, it may turn out to be good if those who are called to

    work it, happen to be a good lot”.
440. It is our duty as the highest constitutional court to recognize such evil and

     increasingly strengthen our initiative to remove them. In the last, we may

     say with the utmost responsibility and all the humility at our command that

     it is only when the constitutional functionaries exercise their powers by and

     under the Constitution that they show deference to the people of India who

     have given the Constitution to themselves.
442. We would also like to refer to a snippet of history from the days of infancy

     of the Constitution and the Indian Republic, which has been narrated in the

     “Eminent Parliamentarians Monograph Series on Dr. Rajendra Prasad”
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 412 of 414
published by the Lok Sabha Secretariat in 1990 (pp. 102). In the matter

    concerning the constitutional role of the President in legislative processes,

    an issue arose during the deliberations on the Hindu Code Bill, wherein the

    first President of India, Dr. Rajendra Prasad, expressed reservations and

    sought to assert his independent authority to withhold assent to the

    legislation. A reference was made to the first Attorney General for India,

    M.C. Setalvad, who clarified that the role of the President under the Indian

    Constitution was analogous to that of the British monarch and he was

    expected to serve as a constitutional figurehead. The Attorney General

    opined that the President does not possess the authority to act contrary to the

    advice of the Council of Ministers. The opinion of the Attorney General was,

    with respect and magnanimity, accepted by the President and thus the

    ensuing controversy between the Prime Minister and the President was laid

    to rest.241. What emerges from the above is that the fine but pertinent distinction

     between the time-limits that are expressly prescribed and those that are

     judicially evolved is only that in the former the consequence of deemed

     assent emanates from the provision itself whereas in the latter there could be

     no such consequence except to the extent that the courts judicially reviewing

     the action or inaction can direct a decision to be taken within a time-bound

     manner, or in exceptional cases like the one at hand, deem the assent to have
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 206 of 414
been granted under
Article 142
of the Constitution, which we shall again

     discuss in the later parts of this judgment.
271. Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru emphasized the need to foster unity and avoid

        separatist tendencies within the nation. He believed that an elected Governor

        could exacerbate provincial divisions and weaken ties with the Centre. In his

        opinion, “Nevertheless a certain convention and practice helps or hinders

        the growth of separatist tendencies. I feel that if we have an elected

        Governor that would to some extent encourage that separatist provincial

        tendency more than otherwise. There will be far fewer common links with

        the Centre.”19 He argued that duplicating the electoral process for the office

        of Governor would be unnecessary and counterproductive, leading to

        conflicts, wastage of resources, and disruptive tendencies. Supporting the

        nomination of Governors, he asserted that this approach would align with
19

282. Pandit Thakur Das Bhargava adopted the notion that the Governor “shall be

        a guide, philosopher and friend of the Ministry as well as the people in

        general, so that he will exercise certain functions some of which will be in

        the nature of unwritten conventions and some will be such as will be

        expressly conferred by this Constitution.”24 The Governor’s role would

Since a time bound disposal of State Legislations etc. is in the
        interest of the State Governments, it is requested that
        appropriate instructions may be issued to all concerned to
        adhere to the timeline of one month for responding to the
        comments/views of the Central Departments/ Ministries as
        conveyed by the MHA. If the requisite clarifications/views are
        not received from the State Government within the stipulated
        one month's time, it will be construed that the State
        Government agrees with the observation and has no
        comments to offer.

4. It is requested that all concerned may be instructed to
            follow the aforesaid guidelines scrupulously. All the existing
            cases pending with the State Government may kindly be
            reviewed in the light of these guidelines in a time-bound
            manner.

390. The recommendations made by the Sarakaria and Punchhi Commissions

     respectively and the guidelines framed by the Central government taken

     collectively indicate the expediency involved in the disposal of references

     under
Article 201
along with the importance of the role of the President. In

     this backdrop, it must be made clear that the Courts would not be powerless

     to intervene in cases where the exercise of function by a constitutional

     authority is not being done without a reasonable time.
391. We, therefore, deem it appropriate to adopt the timeline prescribed by the

     Ministry of Home Affairs in the aforesaid guidelines, and prescribe that the

     President is required to take a decision on the bills reserved for his

     consideration by the Governor within a period of three months from the date

     on which such reference is received. In case of any delay beyond this period,

     appropriate reasons would have to be recorded and conveyed to the

     concerned State. The States are also required to be collaborative and extend

     co-operation by furnishing answers to the queries which may be raised and

     consider the suggestions made by the Central government expeditiously.


394. We say so because the scheme under which the constitutional heads of both

    the country and the State respectively are required to operate, does not

    contemplate the idea of an ‘absolute veto’, thereby meaning that there can

    be no withholding of assent without furnishing of reasons. This is owing to
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 360 of 414
the fact that the simpliciter withholding of assent both by the President and

     the Governor would be impermissible within the fundamental principles of

     a constitutional democracy.








Securing uniformity and coordinating policy on the basic
        aspects of such matters in List II, having an interface with
        those in List I, cannot be extraneous to the functions
        exercised by the President in considering State Bills, under
Article 201.












vii.    On Exercise of
Article 142.

In our view, that is the only way to ensure that complete justice is done with

     the parties without any delay, and without possibility of any further delay

     due to any inaction on the part of the Governor, or lack of deference on his

     part to this judgment.

H.    CONCLUSION
ii. Secondly, to withhold assent; or

               iii. Thirdly, to reserve the bill for the consideration of the

                    President.
months;




(XIX)    The position of law is settled that even where no time-limit is

         prescribed for the exercise of any power under a statute, it should

         be exercised within a reasonable time. The exercise of powers by

         the President under
Article 201
cannot be said to be immune to this

         general principle of law. Keeping in mind the expedient nature of

         the provision and having regard to the reports of Sarkaria and

         Puncchi Commissions, as well as the Memorandum dated

         04.02.2016 issued by the Ministry of Home Affairs, we prescribe

         that the President is required to take a decision on the bills reserved

         for his consideration by the Governor within a period of three

         months from the date on which such reference is received. In case

         of any delay beyond this period, appropriate reasons would have to

         be recorded and conveyed to the concerned State.

443. Such was the commitment shown by the stalwarts to upholding the spirit of

    the Constitution.

444. We hope and trust that the Governor and the State Government would work

    in tandem and harmoniously keeping the interests and well-being of the

    people as their paramount consideration.

445. We direct the Registry to send one copy each of this judgment to all the High

     Courts and the Principal Secretaries to the Governors of all States.
446. In the result, the present writ petition stands disposed of in the aforesaid

     terms.

447. Pending application(s), if any, stand disposed of.

page 414 414 air 1963 sc 1618,74097,37779,Federal disputes,"Fact: The petitioner, being aggrieved by the inaction on part of the Governor, had to ultimately file the present writ petition before this Court. The State Legislature, on 18.11.2023, convened a special session and repassed the 10 bills. The bills were passed without any material change and were forwarded to the Governor’s Secretariat on the same day for his assent.
Issue: The Governor has reserved the Bill viz. Tamil Nadu Fisheries University (Amendment) BIii, 2023 for the consideration of the Hon'ble President. The Bill is in Entry No.66 of the Union List of the Seventh Schedule.
Petitioner's Argument: Governor could not have kept the Bills submitted to him in a cold storage without taking a decision on them. The fact that he entered no discussion with the State Government or the Chief Minister in relation to the Bills further indicates that the Governor exercised a pocket veto. He brought the constitutional machinery to a standstill.
Respondent's Argument: The petitioner, on the other hand, has averred in its writ petition that such questions were against the established practices to the selection of constitutional posts. Delays in appointments to the TNPSC resulted in non-availability of sufficient members, which detrimentally affected the functioning of the Executive. The petitioner have prayed for a declaration that the reservation of the bills by the Governor for the consideration of the President was illegal.
Precedent Analysis: The Bill falls, mainly, within the scope of the following entries of the Union, State and Concurrent Lists. In a similar case, Dr. K. Ponmudy, a minister in the Government of Tamil Nadu was convicted and sentenced by the Madras High Court against which he filed an appeal before this Court. This Court, vide order dated 11.03.2024, suspended the conviction of Dr. Pon Mudy from its operation.
Analysis of the law: The Governor sought to clarify that the 10 Bills to which he had withheld assent simpliciter were not returned to the Legislature for reconsideration as stipulated in the first proviso of Article 200. The Governor clarified that since the Bills suffered from repugnancy, he was reserving the said Bills for the consideration of the President.
Court's Reasoning: The Governor took a decision on the 12 Bills on 13.11.2023 by withholding assent simpliciter to 10 bills. He did not convey any message to the State Legislature for reconsideration of the said Bills as prescribed under the first paragraph of W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023.
Conclusion: An elected Governor could exacerbate provincial divisions and weaken ties with the Centre. Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru emphasized the need to foster unity and avoid separatist tendencies within the nation.","Fact: The Madras High Court has issued notice to the Governor of the State of Tamil Nadu on a writ petition challenging his refusal to grant assent to 10 bills passed by the State Legislature.
Issue: The Governor of Tamil Nadu has reserved the following Bills for consideration by the President of India:
Petitioner's Argument: A Division Bench of the Jammu and Kashmir High Court, headed by Chief Justice Gita Mittal, is hearing a petition challenging the constitutional validity of the Jammu and Kashmir Shops and Establishments Bill, 2023.
Respondent's Argument: The petitioner has prayed for a declaration that the President's decision not to assent to the bills repassed by the State Legislature and presented before him as illegal.
Precedent Analysis: This Court is hearing the appeal of the Governor of Tamil Nadu against the order of the Madras High Court suspending the conviction and sentence of a minister under the Representation of the People’s Act, 1951.
Analysis of the law: The Governor of Arunachal Pradesh has sent a letter to the President clarifying that he had withheld assent to 10 Bills to which he had sent them back to the legislative assembly for reconsideration as stipulated in the first proviso of Article 200.
Court's Reasoning: The respondents are the Governor of Arunachal Pradesh, the Council of Ministers of the State, and the President of India.
Conclusion: The term of office of the Governor of Jammu and Kashmir is for a period of five years from the date of his assumption of office.","Fact: the Legislature for the State of Tamil Nadu, between 13.01.2020 and 28.04.2023, enacted and forwarded 12 Bills to the Governor for grant of assent as per Article 200 of the Constitution . the petitioner, being aggrieved by the inaction on part of the Governor, had to ultimately file the present writ petition before this Court .
Issue: the Hon'ble Governor has reserved the Bill viz. Tamil Nadu Fisheries University (Amendment) BIii, 2023 for the consideration of the Hon. President . the Bills suffer from repugnancy .
Petitioner's Argument: the Governor could not have kept the Bills submitted to him in a cold storage without taking any decision on them . the substantive part of Article 200 uses the expression ""shall declare"" which indicates that the function of the Governor is mandatory .
Respondent's Argument: petitioner has averred in its writ petition that such queries were against the established practices to the selection of constitutional posts . delays in appointments to the TNPSC resulted in non-availability of sufficient members, which detrimentally affected the functioning of the Executive.
Precedent Analysis: in a similar case, a minister in the Government of Tamil Nadu was convicted and sentenced by the Madras High Court against which, he filed an appeal before this Court . this Court, vide order dated 11.03.2024, suspended the conviction of Dr. K. Ponmudy from its operation .
Analysis of the law: the 10 bills to which he withheld assent simpliciter were not returned to the Legislature for reconsideration . the governor clarified that since the Bills suffered from repugnancy, he was reserving the said Bills for consideration of the president .
Court's Reasoning: this Court issued notice to the respondents on 10.11.2023 . the Governor, forthwith, took a decision on the 12 Bills on 13.11.2023 . he did not convey any message to the State Legislature for reconsideration of the said bills .
Conclusion: aaron miller: assent to a provision expressly prescribed is not a consequence of it . he says judicial review can direct a decision to be taken within a time-bound manner . miller says he believes an elected governor could exacerbate divisions and weaken ties with the centre ."

Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                    Page 5 of 189


10. On 25.03.2004, a criminal complaint as regards the offence punishable under
Sections 22
and
29
of the NDPS Act respectively was filed against the

     respondents by one Mr. R. Roy (hereinafter, the “complainant”), an
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                     Page 8 of 189
intelligence officer of the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence, New Delhi,

      (hereinafter, the “appellant”) before the Special Court for NDPS cases, New

      Delhi.

12.   The respondents applied for bail before the Special Judge and the same was

      declined. However, the High Court vide a common Judgment and Order dated

      11.01.2005 granted bail to the respondent no. 3 along with several others. The
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                      Page 9 of 189
respondent nos. 1 and 2 respectively, had also moved the High Court for bail

     and vide a common Judgment and Order dated 22.08.2005, the High Court

     stated that no offence under the
NDPS Act
was made out and directed that the

     respondent nos. 1 and 2 be released on bail upon furnishing a personal bond in

     the sum of Rs. 25,000 with one surety of the like amount to the satisfaction of

     the concerned trial court. The High Court in its common Judgement and Order

     dated 22.08.2005 had framed two questions of law for the purpose of

     considering the plea for bail – (a) Whether Buprenorphine Hydrochloride is a

     “psychotropic substance” within the meaning of the
NDPS Act
?, and (b) If yes,

     whether Buprenorphine Hydrochloride is a “psychotropic substance” to which

     Chapter VII of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Rules, 1985

     (hereinafter, the “NDPS Rules”) apply and to what effect? The first question

     was answered in the affirmative, however, on the second question, it was

     concluded that since Buprenorphine Hydrochloride is a psychotropic substance

     not included under Schedule I of the NDPS Rules, its manufacture, possession,

     sale and transport etc. would neither be prohibited nor regulated by the NDPS

     Rules and consequently by the
NDPS Act
. It was observed that an examination

     of Schedule H of the Drugs and Cosmetics Rules, 1940 (hereinafter, the “D&C

     Rules”) made it clear that Buprenorphine Hydrochloride was listed therein as

     a “Prescription Drug” and therefore, the offence would fall within the rigours

     of the D&C Act and its Rules.
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                   Page 10 of 189
14. The respondents thereafter preferred an application under
Section 216
of the

      Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (hereinafter, the “
CrPC
”) before the Special

      Judge for amendment/alteration of charge. Before filing the application under
Section 216
CrPC, the respondent no. 3 had filed a Criminal Revision Petition

      No. 204 of 2005 before the High Court challenging the order dated 03.02.2005

      and 08.02.2005 respectively, which framed charge against the respondents

      herein. Vide judgment and order dated 01.08.2006, the High Court disposed of

      the petition by observing that the application under Section 216 pending before

      the Special Judge shall be decided first before the matter is proceeded with. The

      relevant observations are as follows:
15.   The Special Judge heard the submissions of the counsel with respect to the
Section 216
CrPC application made before him. Vide order dated 30.11.2006,

      the Special Judge echoed the reasoning adopted by the High Court while

      granting bail to the respondents and also arrived at the conclusion that the

      respondents are to be tried under the D&C Act and the Rules thereunder. The

      Special Judge allowed the application filed under
Section 216
CrPC taking the

      view that since the offence under the
NDPS Act
was not made out, the file be
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                       Page 12 of 189
sent to the ACMM, New Delhi for further proceedings. The relevant

      observations are as thus:
ii.   Criminal Appeal No. 272 of 2014
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                     Page 17 of 189
19. On 02.03.2005, the appellant through its Intelligence Officer filed a complaint

     against the respondent no. 1 under
Sections 8(c)
and
22(c)
of the NDPS Act

     respectively and on 04.05.2005, upon a prima facie case being made against

     the accused, a charge for the offence under
Section 22(c)
was framed. On

     28.11.2006, in the midst of the trial and during the stage of recording evidence,

     the respondent filed an application under
Section 216
CrPC drawing the

     attention of the Special Judge to the decision rendered by the Delhi High Court

     in
Rajender Gupta v. State
reported in 2005 SCC OnLine Del 873 which held

     that dealing in substances mentioned in the
Schedule to the NDPS Act
and not

     mentioned in Schedule I of the NDPS Rules would not constitute an offence

     under the
NDPS Act
. As a consequence, the respondent no. 1 prayed that the

     charge be altered and the case be remitted to the appropriate court for trial under

     the D&C Act.


30. The offences under
Drugs and Cosmetics Act
and Rules are
           triable by the court of Metropolitan Magistrate and not by the
           Special Hon'ble or Court of Sessions. As such this case is
           remanded to Ld Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Delhi to deal with
           the case in accordance with law. Ld CMM may also assign the
           case to any other Metropolitan Magistrate as may deem fit. It is
           made clear that question of limitation would not stand in the
           present case.
Parties are directed to appear before Ld CMM on 07.05.2010.”

                                             (Emphasis supplied)
17. Pending Applications stand disposed of.”

C.    ISSUES FOR DETERMINATION


42. There exist three Conventions (collectively referred to as the “International

      Drug Control Conventions”) under the auspices of the United Nations which

      form the current normative framework for the control of narcotic drugs,

      psychotropic substances and precursor chemicals. They are :- The Single

      Convention on Narcotic Drugs, 1961; The Convention on Psychotropic

      Substances of 1971; and the United Nations Convention against the Illicit

      Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances of 1988. India has

      acceded to and is therefore, a party to the abovementioned International Drug

      Control Convention framework.

Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                    Page 55 of 189","16.   Aggrieved by the aforesaid order dated 30.11.2006 passed by the Special

      Judge, the appellant preferred Criminal Revision Petition No. 494 of 2007. Vide

      judgment and order dated 13.07.2011, the High Court dismissed the revision

      petition. The High Court followed the rationale adopted by this Court in State
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                     Page 13 of 189
of Uttranchal v. Rajesh Kumar Gupta reported in (2007) 1 SCC 355 wherein

     it was observed that if any particular drug does not find mention in the Schedule

     I appended to the NDPS Rules, then the provisions of
Section 8
of the NDPS

     Act would have no application whatsoever. On the question of the respondents

     being discharged under
Section 216
CrPC, the High Court remarked that it

     would not be right to say that the Special Judge had discharged the respondents.

     The matter was accordingly remitted to the Metropolitan Magistrate to proceed

     in accordance with the provisions of the D&C Act. The relevant observations

     have been reproduced below:
20. On 06.07.2009, the appellant moved an application before the Special Judge

     for stay of the proceedings since the matter on this issue was sub-judice before

     this Court by way of an SLP and also that the decision of the Delhi High Court

     in
Rajender Gupta
(supra) was challenged in appeal. Since this application was

     not being heard, the appellant also preferred a petition before the High Court

     seeking stay of the further proceedings. Vide order dated 16.09.2009, the High
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                       Page 18 of 189
Court directed the Special Judge to hear and dispose of the said application in

     the first instance before proceeding with the main matter.
21. Vide order dated 17.04.2010, the Special Judge observed that the judgement

     rendered in
Rajender Gupta
(supra) was not stayed by this Court in appeal.
In

     fact, the same was even approved by this Court in Rajesh Kumar Gupta

     (supra). Therefore, the application dated 06.07.2009 made by the appellant was

     rejected. In the same breath, the Special Judge held that Buprenorphine

     Hydrochloride is a Schedule “H” drug under the D&C Act read with its Rules.

     Despite it being a psychotropic substance under the
NDPS Act
, it was not

     included in Schedule I of the NDPS Rules. That being the case, dealing in the

     said substance is not prohibited under the
NDPS Act
and the offence under
Sections 8
and
22
of the NDPS Act respectively, were not made out. However,

     it was observed that the respondent no. 1 was involved in the illegal sale of the

     said substance since no record had been maintained in that regard. In such a

     scenario, the case was remanded to the Court of the Metropolitan Magistrate,

     Delhi to deal with in accordance with law. The relevant observations of the

     Special Judge are reproduced hereinbelow:
22. Aggrieved by the aforesaid order, the appellant preferred a Criminal M.C. No.

     2335 of 2010 under
Section 482
of the CrPC before the High Court. However,

     vide impugned Judgement and Order dated 20.03.2013, the High Court

     dismissed the petition being devoid of any merit and observed as thus:
where relying on Rajinder Gupta and Rajesh Kumar Gupta, the
           learned Single Judge of this Court held that a person found in
           possession of Buprenorphine Hydrochloride will not be guilty
           under
Section 22
of the NDPS Act.
26. It was further submitted that the High Court committed an error in placing

     reliance on the decision in
State of Uttaranchal vs. Rajesh Kumar Gupta
reported in 2007 (1) SCC 355 as
the said decision
is not applicable to the facts

     of the present case. In the said case, the accused who possessed an Ayurveda

     Shashtri Degree was running a clinic while being assisted by eight other

     medical practitioners who were Allopathic and Ayurvedic doctors. A total of 7

     medicines were seized and all of them were mentioned in Schedules G & H of

     the D&C Rules and the same were said to be used for medical purposes.

     However, in the present case, the contraband found in the illegal possession of

     the respondent no. 1 was without any label. Furthermore, the respondents are

     neither registered medical practitioners nor were they able to produce any

     document, permit or license to deal with said substances or medicines.
27. It was vehemently submitted that the High Court had erred in holding that Rules

     53 and 64 of the NDPS Rules respectively, only pertain to the psychotropic

     substances mentioned in Schedule I to the NDPS Rules and since

     Buprenorphine Hydrochloride is a psychotropic substance mentioned in the
Schedule to the NDPS Act
but not in Schedule I to the NDPS Rules, the offence

     under the
NDPS Act
would not be made out. It was argued that the said

     observation was contrary to the subsequent judgement passed by this Court in
Union of India & Anr. Vs. Sanjeev V. Deshpande
reported in 2014 13 SCC 1,
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                    Page 24 of 189
wherein it has been clearly held that the prohibition under 8 of the
NDPS Act
is attracted in respect of the psychotropic substances listed in
Schedule to the

     NDPS Act
as well as Schedule I to the NDPS Rules framed under the Act. It

     was further held that the
NDPS Act
does not contemplate the framing of rules

     for prohibiting activities involving drugs and psychotropic substances for the

     reason that
Section 8(c)
of the NDPS Act already prohibits such activities.
28. As regards the issue of prospective overruling, the counsel submitted that the

     decision of this Court in Sanjeev V. Deshpande (supra) overruled the decision

     in Rajesh Kumar Gupta (supra) without a specific declaration that the same

     was prospectively overruled. In the absence of such a declaration, the

     interpretation of law in Sanjeev V. Deshpande (supra) must be held to be

     retrospectively applicable to all cases, including those which have been

     pending before different courts.
30. In the last, the learned counsel submitted that subsequent to bail being granted,

     the respondents, as a clever device, filed an application under
section 216
of

     the CrPC, seeking alteration of charges. The Special Judge, in complete

     disregard to the direction passed by this Court, allowed the application and held

     that the offence under the
NDPS Act
is not made out qua all the respondents,

     and that the case rather pertains to the D&C Act. Such an order could not be

     said to be in tune with the judgement rendered by this Court in
K. Ravi vs. State

     of Tamil Nadu & Anr.
reported in (2024) SCC OnLine SC 2283, wherein it

     was specifically held that
Section 216
of the CrPC does not entitle the accused

     to file a fresh application seeking discharge, once the charges have been framed

     by the Court. It was further stated therein that an application under
Section 216
CrPC is sometimes filed due to the ignorance of law and also with an aim to

     deliberately delay the trial proceedings. In the present case, the application filed

     under
Section 216
CrPC was absolutely misconceived and was with a sole

     intent to derail the trial proceedings.
35. The counsel vehemently submitted that the decision in Sanjeev V. Deshpande

     (supra) must strictly be held to be prospectively applicable. If not, it would

     serve to cause immense prejudice to the respondents who have already been

     discharged by the Special Judge.
40.   As per its Preamble, the NDPS Act, 1985 seeks to consolidate and amend the

      law relating to narcotic drugs, make stringent provisions for the control and

      regulation of operations relating to narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances

      and implement the provisions of the International Conventions on Narcotic

      Drugs and Psychotropic Substances, amongst others. This Court in
State of

      Rajasthan v. Udai Lal
reported in (2008) 11 SCC 408 elaborated that the
NDPS Act
is a special Act which has been enacted with a view to make

      stringent provisions for the control and regulation of operations relating to

      narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances and stated as thus:
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                       Page 30 of 189
41.   Another decision of this Court in
Hira Singh v. Union of India
reported in

      (2020) 20 SCC 272 opined that while determining the “small or commercial

      quantity” of the narcotic drug or psychotropic substance in cases of seizure of

      a mixture of narcotic drugs or psychotropic substances with one or more neutral

      substances, the quantity of the neutral substance(s) is not to be excluded and is

      to be taken into consideration along with the actual content by weight of the

      offending drug. While declaring so, the Court also discussed the object of the
NDPS Act
and highlighted that the enactment was intended to be a deterrent

      against the use of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances. The relevant

      observations are reproduced below:
47.
Article 11
elaborates on record-keeping and provides that – (a) In respect of

     substances in Schedule I, manufacturers and all other authorised persons under
Article 7
shall maintain records indicating the details of the quantity

     manufactured, the quantity held in stock and, for each acquisition and disposal,

     the details of the quantity, date, supplier and recipient; (b) In respect of

     substances in Schedules II and III respectively, manufacturers, wholesale

     distributors, exporters and importers must keep records showing details of the

     quantity manufactured and, for each acquisition and disposal, details of the
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                     Page 36 of 189
quantity, date, supplier and recipient; (c) In respect of substances mentioned in

     Schedule II, retail distributors, institutions for hospitalization and care, and

     scientific institutions must keep records showing for each acquisition and

     disposal, details of the quantity, date, supplier and recipient; (d) Information

     regarding the acquisition and disposal of substances in Schedule III by retail

     distributors, institutions for hospitalization and care, and scientific institutions

     must be made readily available through appropriate methods and by taking into

     account the professional and trade practices of the respective States; and (e) In

     respect of substances in Schedule IV, manufacturers, exporters and importers

     must keep records indicating the quantity manufactured, exported and

     imported.
64.   Under Chapter VII, Rule 64 on ‘General Prohibition’ states that no person shall

      manufacture, possess, transport, import inter-State, export inter-State, sell,

      purchase, consume or use any of the “psychotropic substances specified under

      Schedule I” of the Rules. Rule 65 relating to the ‘Manufacture of psychotropic

      substances’, under sub-rule (1), provides that, subject to the provisions of sub-

      rule (2), the manufacture of any of the psychotropic substances other than those

      specified in Schedule I (i.e., those mentioned only under the
Schedule to the

      Act
) shall be in accordance with the conditions of a licence granted under the
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                      Page 50 of 189
Drugs and Cosmetics Rules, 1945 framed under the
Drugs and Cosmetics Act,

     1940
, by an authority in charge of Drugs Control in a State appointed by the

     State Government in this behalf. Sub-rule (2) states that the authority in charge

     of drugs control in a State/the Licensing Authority shall consult the Drugs

     Controller (India) with regard to the assessed annual requirements of each of

     the psychotropic substance (which has been referred to in sub-rule (1) i.e., the

     substances mentioned only under the
Schedule to the Act
) in bulk form in the

     country and after taking into account the requirement of such psychotropic

     substances in the State, as also the quantity of such substance required for

     supply to other manufacturers outside the State and the quantity of such

     substance required for reasonable inventory to be held by a manufacturer, the

     authority in charge of drugs control in a State/the Licensing Authority shall

     specify, by order, a limit to the quantity of such substance which may be

     manufactured by the manufacturer in the State. Sub-rule (3) provides that the

     specific quantity which may be manufactured by a specific licensee in a year

     shall be intimated by the Licensing Authority to the licensee at the time of

     issuing the licence. Then, there are two provisos to Rule 65 sub-rule (3) which

     were inserted vide notification dated 25th June, 1997 w.e.f 27.06.1997. Through

     the first proviso, an exception has been carved out under the Rule by stating

     that nothing contained in this rule shall apply in case the “psychotropic

     substances specified in Schedule I” are manufactured, possessed, transported,
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                     Page 51 of 189
imported inter-State, exported inter-State, sold, purchased, consumed or used

     subject to other provisions of this Chapter which apply to psychotropic

     substances which are not included in Schedule I and for the purposes mentioned

     in Chapter VIIA. The second proviso contemplates that the authority in charge

     of drugs control in a State shall consult the Narcotics Commissioner before

     issuing a licence under Rule 65 in respect of psychotropic substances included

     in “Schedule I appended to the Rules” and Schedule III appended to the Rules

     as well.
70.   It is evident from the decision of this Court in
Hussain v. State of Kerala
reported in (2000) 8 SCC 139 that “Buprenorphine” being listed under the
Schedule to the NDPS Act
and not under Schedule I of the NDPS Rules, would

      be a psychotropic substance under the NDPS regime, to which
Section 8
of the

      NDPS Act would apply. The appellant therein was found in possession of 6

      ampoules of “Buprenorphine tidigesic” each containing 2ml. The defence that

      he put forth to justify his possession was that he was regularly using it under

      medical advice with a valid prescription. Despite such defence put forward by

      the appellant, the Trial Court convicted him under
Section 21
of the NDPS Act

      which relates to the contravention of the law in respect of “manufactured drugs

      and preparations” since the District Medical Officer had opined that

      “Buprenorphine tidigesic” is a manufactured drug. He was sentenced to
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                      Page 58 of 189
undergo rigorous imprisonment for a period of 10 years along with payment of

     fine. On appeal, the High Court affirmed the conviction and sentence. However,

     this Court opined that the prosecution had, first, failed to prove that the

     substance in question was a ‘manufactured drug’ falling within the definition

     given under
Section 2(xi)
of the NDPS Act. Instead, it was observed that

     “Buprenorphine” is a substance listed under Item 92 of the
Schedule to the Act
and is therefore, a psychotropic substance. Secondly, this Court proceeded to

     examine whether the possession of the said substance would constitute an

     offence under
Section 8
of the NDPS Act. Upon examining Rule 66 of the

     NDPS Rules, it was held that a person is permitted to keep in his possession,

     for his personal medical use, a psychotropic substance up to 100 dosage units

     at a time and the 6 ampoules possessed by the appellant therein could not be

     said to exceed the said limit of 100 dosage units. It was declared that, in such

     circumstances, the conviction and sentence imposed on the appellant was

     without the sanction of law and as a consequence, the judgment of the High

     Court as well as the Sessions Court was set aside. The relevant observations

     made by this Court are reproduced hereinbelow:
72.
In yet another decision of this Court in Ouseph alias
Thankachan v. State of

     Kerala
reported in (2004) 4 SCC 446, it was declared that “Buprenorphine” is

     a psychotropic substance and if an accused is found in possession of the same,

     his case would have to be examined through the rigours of
Sections 8
and
22
of the NDPS Act read with Rule 66 of the NDPS Rules respectively. The

     appellant therein was found to be in possession of 110 ampoules of

     Buprenorphine. He stood convicted under
Section 22
of the NDPS Act and

     was sentenced to ten years of rigorous imprisonment along with fine. The High

     Court dismissed the appeal challenging the order of conviction and sentence.

     This Court considered the alternate argument canvassed under
Section 27
of

     the NDPS Act which provides that whoever, in contravention of any provision

     of this Act, possesses any psychotropic substance, “which is proved to have

     been intended for his personal consumption and not for sale or distribution”

     shall be punishable for a term which may extend to 6 months or fine or both.

     To consider the applicability of the aforesaid provision, it had to be determined

     whether the substance was in a “small quantity” and if so, whether it was
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                     Page 62 of 189
intended for personal consumption. Answering both the questions in the

     affirmative, it was held that the offence proved to have been committed by the

     appellant would fall under
Section 27
of the Act and accordingly, the conviction

     of the appellant therein was altered. The relevant observations made by this

     Court are reproduced as thus:
73.
In Ravindran alias
John and Anr. v. Superintendent of Customs
reported in

      (2007) 6 SCC 410 the two appellants along with one another accused named

      Hiralal were convicted for the offence under
Section 8(c)
read with
Sections 22
and
29
of the NDPS Act respectively and were sentenced to undergo rigorous

      imprisonment for 10 years along with fine, in relation to the possession,

      transport and sale of diazepam (which is also a substance listed under the
Schedule to the Act
and not in Schedule I of the Rules) weighing 1.53 kgs. On

      appeal, the High Court affirmed the conviction of the appellants but acquitted

      Hiralal against whom it found no satisfactory evidence to prove the charges.

      While dismissing the appeal so far as one of the accused was concerned and

      allowing the appeal against conviction of the other, this Court observed that
Section 8
along with
Section 22(c)
of the NDPS Act would be attracted even

      while the substance in question was Diazepam which is listed as Sl. No. 43
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                     Page 65 of 189
under the
Schedule to the NDPS Act
and absent in Schedule I of the NDPS

      Rules. The relevant observations are as thus:
74.   In Rajesh Kumar Gupta (supra) this Court considered the plea of the State to

      cancel the bail granted to the accused therein. In the said case, the premises of

      the two clinics run by the respondent claiming to be a Ayurvedacharya was

      raided. In the search, 70kg of pure Phenobarbitone was recovered and seized.

      It was further found out that huge quantities of Phenobarbitone was being sold

      to the patients in both his clinics over a period of several years. Therefore, the

      respondent was charged under
Section 8
read with
Section 22
of the NDPS Act.

      While the Special Judge had refused to grant bail, the High Court allowed the

      bail application and released the accused on bail. Agreeing with the High Court,

      this Court held that prima facie the provisions of the Act were not found to be
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                       Page 66 of 189
applicable in a case wherein the psychotropic substance in question was only

     mentioned under the
Schedule to the NDPS Act
and not under Schedule I of

     the NDPS Rules.
75. While declining to interfere with the grant of bail, this Court in Rajesh Kumar

     Gupta (supra) expounded the law on several aspects:
(Emphasis supplied)

     ii. Secondly, it was held that Rules 53 and 64 of the NDPS Rules

         respectively, contain a genus and the other provisions following the

         same under the said Chapter are species thereof. Both the rules were said

         to contain a general prohibition as regard the narcotic drugs and

         psychotropic substances specified in Schedule I of the NDPS Rules.

         Therefore, the reference to “psychotropic substances” in the other rules

         following in Chapters VI and VII of the NDPS Rules respectively were

         also said to be construed as a reference to the Schedule I psychotropic

         substances under the NDPS Rules and not the larger list of substances

         mentioned in the
Schedule to the Act
itself. Hence, if the said

         psychotropic substances do not find a place in Schedule I appended to

         the NDPS Rules, the provisions of
Section 8
of the NDPS Act would
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                      Page 69 of 189
have no application whatsoever. The relevant observations are

         reproduced hereinbelow:
76.
In
Sanjay Kumar Kedia v. Narcotics Control Bureau and Another
reported in

     (2008) 2 SCC 294, this Court was faced with deciding, yet again, whether bail

     should be granted to the appellant wherein he was arrested in connection with

     the commission of offence under
Sections 24
and
29
of the NDPS Act

     respectively, for the illegal sale of drugs, more particularly “Phentermine” and

     “Butalbital”, through the internet. These two substances feature at Sl. Nos. 70

     and 93 of the
Schedule to the NDPS Act
respectively and are not found in

     Schedule I of the NDPS Rules. While agreeing with the High Court that bail

     should not be granted and also providing a disclaimer that the observations

     made by this Court must not influence the decision on trial, this Court said that

     the benefit under
Section 79
of the Information Technology Act, 2002 given to

     the intermediaries could not be extended to the appellant. In declaring so, it was

     held that the two drugs finding a place in the
Schedule to the Act
made it clear

     that they are psychotropic substances falling within the prohibition contained

     in
Section 8
thereof and stated thus:
Furthermore, it was contended that since the drugs were used for medicinal

     purposes, the same is acknowledged in terms of the proviso under
Section 8(c)
of the NDPS Act. However, this Court took the view that the fact that the

     appellant and his co-accused had obtained licences under the D&C Act with a

     general permission for import and export did not enure any particular benefit

     to them since the D&C Act does not deal with exports. The appellant and his

     co-accused being licensees were thus required to comply with the specific

     requirements of the
NDPS Act
and its Rules. Hence, an offence under
Section

     8(c)
was said to have been made out in the absence of an export authorisation

     and it was held that the application for bail was rightly rejected by the Special

     Judge as also the High Court. The relevant observations are as thus:
78. A three-Judge Bench decision of this Court in Union of India and Another v.
Sanjeev V. Deshpande reported in (2014) 13 SCC 1 related to a batch of

     matters, all pertaining to prosecutions under the provisions of the
NDPS Act
wherein each one of the accused was alleged to have been in possession of a

     psychotropic substance only mentioned under the
Schedule to the Act
. In some

     of the cases bail was granted by the concerned High Court and in few others,

     bail was denied. This Court examined the legality of the conclusion that the

     absence of mention of a particular psychotropic substance in Schedule I to the

     Rules excludes the application of
Section 8
, notwithstanding the fact that such

     a drug is included in the
Schedule to the Act
.
The relevant observations are reproduced hereinbelow:
79.   What is discernible from the aforementioned decisions is that, there is no

      shadow of doubt on the proposition that dealing in psychotropic substances not

      finding a mention in Schedule I of the NDPS Rules but finding place in the
Schedule to the Act
, would also constitute an offence under
Section 8
of the

      NDPS Act. Such was the position even before the decision of this Court in

      Sanjeev V. Deshpande (supra). The only decision of this Court that laid down

      an alternate position of law was Rajesh Kumar Gupta (supra) which now

      stands overruled. It would be preposterous to say that no offence could be said

      to be made out when an accused deals with substances which are only

      mentioned under the
Schedule to the Act
. For then, the entire presence of the
Schedule to the Act
would have to be considered unnecessary to the scheme of

      the NDPS Regime. To render an entire Schedule nugatory could not have been

      the intention of the legislature.

80.   What we understand to be the clarification of the position of law in Rajesh

      Kumar Gupta (supra) and Sanjeev V. Deshpande (supra) is thus:




88.   In Sanjeev V. Deshpande (supra), while it was deemed unnecessary to

      undertake a complete analysis of the implications of
Section 80
of the NDPS

      Act in view of the conclusion arrived at therein, yet it was observed that the

      provisions of the
NDPS Act
apply in addition to the provisions of the D&C

      Act. Furthermore, it was stated that while the D&C Act deals with various

      operations of manufacture, sale, purchase etc. of drugs generally, the
NDPS

      Act
deals with a more specific class of drugs and is therefore, a special law on

      the subject. The relevant observations are reproduced hereinbelow:
89. The object of the
NDPS Act
and D&C Act, respectively was reiterated in
State

     of Punjab v. Rakesh Kumar
reported in (2019) 2 SCC 466. Herein, several

     respondent-accused were convicted for the offence committed either under
Section 21
or
Section 22
of the NDPS Act for the bulk possession of

     “manufactured drugs” without any valid authorisation. The High Court allowed

     the applications seeking suspension of sentence, preferred by the respondent-

     accused and directed that they be released on bail pending the final disposal of

     the appeals before it. In doing so, it was observed by the High Court that in

     cases of manufactured drugs, be it containing narcotic drugs or psychotropic

     substances, if manufactured by a manufacturer, the same must be tried if a

     violation has been committed, under the D&C Act and not under the
NDPS

     Act
, except in cases where the substance is in a loose form i.e., powder, liquid

     etc. This Court disagreed with the High Court that the respondent-accused

     could only be prosecuted for an offence under the D&C Act despite there being
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                       Page 89 of 189
a prima facie violation of
Section 8
of the NDPS Act. In opining so, the decision

     elaborated on the following aspects:
accused must be tried under the
Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940
instead of the
NDPS Act
, as they were found in possession of the
              “manufactured drugs”, does not hold good in law. [...]”.

(supra),
Sanjay

            Kumar Kedia

D. Ramakrishnan
(supra) and Sanjeev V.

            Deshpande (supra) have held that an offence under

            mentioned under the
Schedule to the NDPS Act

93. This Court in
Sarwan Kumar and Another v. Madan Lal Aggarwal
reported

     in (2003) 4 SCC 147, opined that when this Court interprets an existing law

     while overruling the interpretation assigned to it earlier, it cannot be said that a

     new law is laid down. The declaration of law relates back to the law itself. In

     other words, it would be deemed that the law was never otherwise.
Herein, a 5-
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                      Page 101 of 189
judge bench of this Court in Gian Devi Anand v. Jeevan Kumar and Others

     reported in (1985) 2 SCC 683 had held that the rule of heritability extends to

     the statutory tenancy of a commercial premises as much as to a residential

     premises under the
Delhi Rent Control Act, 1958
.
In light of the same, the

     question for determination in
Sarwan Kumar
(supra) was whether a decree for

     ejectment which was passed by a civil court qua a commercial tenancy on the

     basis that the tenancy was not heritable, before the declaration of law in Gian

     Devi Anand (supra), was executable or not? By stating that the jurisdiction of

     the civil court to pass the decree for ejectment was barred and that the decree

     obtained by the decree-holder cannot be executed owing to it being a nullity

     and non-est, this Court observed as follows:
Invocation of the doctrine of “prospective overruling” is left to the
           discretion of the Court to mould with the justice of the cause or the
           matter before the Court. This Court while deciding Gian Devi
           Anand case [(1985) 2 SCC 683 : 1985 Supp (1) SCR 1] did not
           hold that the law declared by it would be prospective in operation.
           It was not for the High Court to say that the law laid down by this
           Court in Gian Devi Anand case [(1985) 2 SCC 683 : 1985 Supp
           (1) SCR 1] would be prospective in operation. If this is to be
           accepted then conflicting rules can supposedly be laid down by
           different High Courts regarding the applicability of the law laid
           down by this Court in Gian Devi Anand case [(1985) 2 SCC 683 :
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                    Page 102 of 189
When the court decides that the interpretation given to a particular
           provision earlier was not legal, it declares the law as it stood right
           from the beginning as per its decision. In Gian Devi case [(1980)
           17 DLT 197] the interpretation given by the Delhi High Court that
           commercial tenancies were not heritable was overruled being
           erroneous. Interpretation given by the Delhi High Court was not
           legal. The interpretation given by this Court declaring that the
           commercial tenancies heritable would be the law as it stood from
           the beginning as per the interpretation put by this Court. It would
           be deemed that the law was never otherwise. Jurisdiction of the
           civil court has not been taken away by the interpretation given
           by this Court. This Court declared that the civil court had no
           jurisdiction to pass such a decree. It was not a question of taking
           away the jurisdiction; it was the declaration of law by this Court
           to that effect. The civil court assumed the jurisdiction on the basis
           of the interpretation given by the High Court in Gian Devi
           case [(1980) 17 DLT 197] which was set aside by this Court.
(Emphasis supplied)
94. While addressing the issue of the temporal and retrospective effect of a judicial

     decision and declaring that a tribunal or court is bound by a higher court’s

     decision on the point in issue, irrespective of whether it is declared either prior
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                     Page 103 of 189
to or subsequent to the order which is sought to be called into question by a

     party, this Court in
Assistant Commissioner, Income Tax, Rajkot v.

     Saurashtra Kutch Stick Exchange Limited
reported in (2008) 14 SCC 171

     stated that a judicial decision acts retrospectively by placing reliance on the

     Blackstonian theory. According to this theory, it is not the function of the court

     to pronounce a “new rule” but to maintain and expound the “old one”.

     Therefore, if the subsequent decision alters or overrules the earlier one, it

     cannot be said to have made a new law. The correct principle of law is just

     discovered and applied retrospectively. In other words, if in a given situation

     an earlier decision of the court operated for quite some time and it is overruled

     by a subsequent decision, the decision rendered subsequently would have

     retrospective effect and would serve to clarify the legal position which was not

     clearly understood earlier. Any transaction would then be covered by the law

     declared by the overruling decision. The overruling is generally retrospective

     with the only caveat being that matters that are res judicatae or accounts that

     have been settled in the meantime would not be disturbed. The relevant

     observations made by this Court are reproduced hereinbelow:
95. Resorting to the doctrine of “prospective overruling” is therefore, an exception

     to the normal rule that a judgement or decision applies retrospectively and to

     the general rule of doctrine of precedent. The application of the doctrine is

     based on the philosophy that “The past cannot always be erased by a new

     judicial declaration”. That the Court can contemplate giving prospective

     application to a law declared by it, stems from the premise that the Court is

     neither required to apply a decision retrospectively nor is it prohibited from

     applying it retrospectively. The merits and demerits of retrospective or
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                  Page 105 of 189
prospective application is examined and the doctrine is applied wherever

      appropriate and necessary. This is precisely why the express declaration by a

      court that its decision is prospectively applicable is a requisite condition.

      Prospectivity as a concept cannot be considered to be inhered in all situations

      since the intention to attribute prospectivity to a decision must be limpid and

      clear. The same has been reiterated in a catena of decisions by this Court.
96.   That there is no prospective overruling unless it is so indicated expressly and

      in the clearest possible terms was
laid down by
this Court in
P.V. George and

      Others v. State of Kerala and Others
reported in (2007) 3 SCC 557.
“19. It may be true that when the doctrine of stare decisis is not
            adhered to, a change in the law may adversely affect the interest
            of the citizens. The doctrine of prospective overruling although is
            applied to overcome such a situation, but then it must be stated
            expressly. The power must be exercised in the clearest possible
            term. The decisions of this Court are clear pointer thereto.

xxx            xxx          xxx
97.   In another decision of this Court in B.A. Linga Reddy and Others v.
Karnataka State Transport Authority and Others reported in (2015) 4 SCC

      515, it was reiterated that in the absence of a declaration that the decision would

      operate prospectively, it must be given retrospective effect. The relevant

      observations are as thus:
98.
In yet another decision of this Court in
Manoj Parihar and Others v. State of

     Jammu and Kashmir and Others
reported in (2022) 14 SCC 72, where the

     bench comprised of one of us (J.B. Pardiwala, J.), it was opined that the doctrine

     of prospective overruling must be exercised in explicit terms and therefore, the

     law declared by this Court would have a retrospective effect unless stated

     otherwise. The observations are reproduced as thus:
99. Prospective Overruling which was initially a doctrine familiar to American

     Jurisprudence was applied by this Court for the first time in
C. Golak Nath and

     Others v. State of Punjab and Another
reported in AIR 1967 SC 1643. By

     setting out certain limits for the application of this doctrine, it was laid down

     that the doctrine of prospective overruling can be invoked only in matters

     arising under the Constitution; that it could be applied only by this Court since

     it has the constitutional jurisdiction to declare the law binding on all courts in

     the country; and that the scope of the retroactive operation of the law which has

     been declared in supersession of its earlier decision(s) would be left to the

     Court’s discretion to be moulded in accordance with the justice of the cause or

     matter before it. Over the period of time, this doctrine has been extended to the

     interpretation of ordinary statutes as well. Furthermore, the doctrine has also

     been applied in situations wherein the Court has dealt with the issue or the

     question of law for the first time. Therefore, it can be said that case-law

     trajectory has seen both the prospective declaration and the prospective

     overruling of law.

100. This Court in
Baburam v. C.C.Jacob and Others
reported in (1999) 3 SCC

     362 elaborated on the reasons which necessitate the prospective declaration of
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                     Page 109 of 189
law by this Court, by stating that the object would be to avoid the reopening of

     settled issues, to prevent the multiplicity of proceedings, to curb uncertainty in

     law and thwart avoidable litigation. It was stated that, on the application of this

     doctrine, it is deemed that all actions taken contrary to the declaration of law

     but prior to the date of the declaration, are validated. The subordinate forums

     which are legally bound to apply the declaration of law made by this Court are

     also required to apply such a dictum to cases which would arise in future only.

     The pertinent observations made in the decision are reproduced hereinbelow:
101. However, partly differing from the interpretation given in
Baburam
(supra),

     the Constitutional Bench of this Court in
Somaiya Organics (India) Ltd. and

     Another v. State of U.P. and Another
reported in (2001) 5 SCC 519 had

     clarified that the application of the doctrine of prospective overruling would

     not have the effect of validating an invalid law.
Therein, initially, a seven-judge

     bench of this Court in
Synthetics and Chemicals Ltd. and Others v. State of

     U.P. and Others
reported in (1990) 1 SCC 109, held that the provisions of State

     enactments permitting the levy of excise duty in the form of vend fee must be

     struck down prospectively from the date of its judgment i.e., from 25.10.1989.

     There was, however, some confusion on whether the State was entitled to

     collect the taxes in respect of the period prior to 25.10.1989 or not. As per the

     majority, prospective overruling, despite the terminology is only a recognition

     of the principle that the court moulds the relief claimed in order to meet the
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                     Page 111 of 189
justice of the case, more particularly justice not in its logical but in its equitable

     sense. Prospective overruling could be seen as a method which was evolved by

     the courts to adjust the competing rights of the parties so as to save transactions,

     whether statutory or otherwise, that were effected by the earlier law. Therefore,

     it was held that it would not be right to say that upon applying the doctrine of

     prospective overruling, an invalid law has been held to be valid during the past

     period. All that is done is that the declaration of invalidity of the legislation is

     directed to take effect from a future date. In the facts of the case, it was

     elaborated that what was intended was that the status quo as on 25.10.1989 be

     maintained as regards the actual payment or levy concerned. Hence, what had

     gone into the coffers of the Government with or without any strings attached,

     was to remain with it and what was not received was also not to be later realised

     by the Government. The relevant observations are reproduced hereinbelow:
Ultimately, it is a question of this Court's discretion and is, for this
           reason, relatable directly to the words of the Court granting the
           relief.

           given in para 89 of the judgment in second
Synthetics
case [(1990)
           1 SCC 109] and applying the said principles to the present appeals
           the only conclusion which can be arrived at is that this Court
           intended the status quo as on 25-10-1989 to be maintained as
           regards actual payment or levy was concerned. What had gone to
           the coffers of the Government with or without any strings attached,
           was to remain with it and what was not received could not be
           realised by the Government.

Strictly speaking, this would have entitled the appellant to a refund
           from the respondents of all amounts collected by way of vend fee.
           But because, as stated in Synthetics [(1990) 1 SCC 109] decision
           itself, over a period of time imposts and levies had been imposed
           by virtue of the earlier decision and that the States as well as the
           petitioners and manufacturers had adjusted their rights and their
           positions on that basis, this relief was denied. The Court did not,
           by denying the relief, authorise or validate what had been
           declared to be illegal or void nor did it imbue the legislature with
           competence up to the date of the judgment.”

103. Therefore, the court does not make legal, something that is illegal, for the past

     period by invoking the doctrine of prospective overruling. On the contrary,

     upon giving due consideration to what has been expounded in
Somaiya

     Organics
(supra), it is clear that the idea behind the invocation of the doctrine

     is to meet the justice of each case in the most practical and equitable sense. In
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                    Page 115 of 189
addition to this, the doctrine also seeks to adjust and balance the competing

     rights of all the parties involved i.e., parties who on one hand, had acted solely

     on the basis of an invalid law or an overruled decision and altered their

     respective rights and positions, and on the other, the parties who had brought a

     successful case in establishing that the law or decision which existed in

     operation was invalid. To prevent the chaotic unscrambling of actions done in

     the past, a middle-ground is reached by postponing the decision declaring the

     invalidity to a particular date while keeping in mind the larger interest of doing

     complete justice. That ensuring “complete justice” in the most equitable way is

     the true essence of the doctrine is also evident from the fact that this Court also

     has, on several occasions, prescribed the limits of retroactivity of the law

     declared by it.

104. Such a demarcation of the limits of retroactivity was done in
Kailash Chand

     Sharma v. State of Rajasthan and Others
reported in (2002) 6 SCC 562,

     wherein the issue was as regards the grant of bonus marks in the recruitment

     process for Primary School Teachers in Zila Parishads solely to applicants

     belonging to the district and rural areas of certain specified districts and,

     whether the same would be violative of
Articles 14
and
16
of the Constitution

     respectively.
By relying on the Full Bench decision of the High Court dated

     21.10.1999 rendered in
Deepak Kumar Suthar v. State of Rajasthan
reported
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                     Page 116 of 189
in (1999) 2 Raj LR 692 (FB), the impugned Full Bench decision dated

     18.11.1999 and another impugned Division Bench decision of the High Court

     reiterated that, providing any form of advantage or weightage in public

     employment in any State service, would not be permissible on the ground of

     place of birth or residence or, on the ground of being a resident of an urban area

     or rural area. This Court while agreeing with the impugned decisions had

     observed that the legality of the selection process which included the addition

     of bonus marks could not have been seriously doubted either by the appointing

     authorities or by the candidates, in view of the judicial precedents which

     operated at the relevant time. A cloud of doubt was cast on the said practice

     only at a time when the selection process was completed and the results were

     declared or about to be declared. Therefore, under such circumstances, it was

     considered proper to apply the impugned judgment dated 18.11.1999 rendered

     by the Full Bench of the High Court prospectively. Such a recourse was also

     considered appropriate considering that none of the appointed or selected

     candidates were made parties to the respective writ petitions before the High

     Court. Therefore, this Court thought fit to not implement the Full Bench

     decision of the High Court, which treaded a new path, to the detriment of the

     candidates who were already appointed. With a view to balance the competing

     claims, the relief was confined only to the petitioners who were affected by the

     grant of bonus marks and who had moved the High Court on or before
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                     Page 117 of 189
17.11.1999. Therefore, the appointments made on or after 18.11.1999 was

     subject to the claims of the writ petitioners i.e., if upon a fresh consideration of

     the candidature of the writ petitioners as against those candidates who were

     appointed on or after 18.11.1999, the writ petitioners were found to have had

     superior merit, they would be offered appointments even by displacing the

     candidates appointed on or after 18.11.1999, if necessary. In other words, only

     for the petitioners who had moved the High Court prior to 18.11.1999,

     retrospective benefit of the Full Bench decision was given. Otherwise, the

     appointments made up to 17.11.1999 were not to be reopened or reconsidered.

     However, the aforesaid relief was tailored with a clear disclaimer that it was

     moulded in view of the special facts and circumstances of the case and while

     acting within the jurisdiction conferred upon this Court under
Article 142
of

     the Constitution. The relevant observations are reproduced hereinbelow:
107. While holding so, it was stated that courts can make the law
laid down by
them

     prospective in operation to prevent the unsettlement of settled positions, to

     prevent administrative chaos and to meet the ends of justice. The law on the

     subject being in a state of flux was also a factor that was emphasized to a large

     extent.
In
B. Karunakar
(supra), the authorities all over the country had

     proceeded on the basis that there was no need to furnish a copy of the report of
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                    Page 121 of 189
the enquiry officer to the delinquent employee and innumerable employees

     were also punished as a result of those proceedings. There were some cases

     wherein the orders of punishment had become final and in some others, the

     matters were pending in courts at different stages. Reopening all those

     disciplinary proceedings would have resulted in grave prejudice to the

     administration which was considered as far outweighing the benefit which

     would potentially accrue to the employees concerned if the disciplinary

     proceedings were allowed to be disturbed.
Therefore, on a holistic perspective

     and giving due regard to both administrative reality and public interest, it was

     considered necessary that the prospectivity given to the decision in
Mohd.

     Ramzan Khan
(supra) not be disturbed. The relevant observations of the

     majority opinion are reproduced hereinbelow:
Ramzan Khan
case [(1991) 1 SCC 588 : 1991 SCC (L&S) 612 :
108. The minority opinion rendered by K. Ramaswamy, J., also illustrated the

     circumstances and the potential reasons due to which the doctrine of

     prospective overruling may be resorted to. It was opined that under

     constitutional law, retrospective operation of an overruling judgment is neither

     required nor prohibited. The decision as regards retrospectivity or prospectivity

     must depend on the facts and circumstances of each case, as also the nature and

     purpose which the overruling decision seeks to serve. Other relevant factors

     which must be taken account of include the justifiable reliance which has been

     placed by the administration on the overruled decision, the ability to effectuate

     the new rule adopted in the overruling case without doing injustice and whether

     the likelihood of its retrospective operation substantially burdens the

     administration of justice. Prior history of the rule in question, its purpose and

     effect and whether the retroactive operation will accelerate or retard its

     operation are also significant considerations. The relevant observations are

     reproduced as thus:
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                    Page 124 of 189
ability to effectuate the new rule adopted in the overruling case
           without doing injustice; the likelihood of its operation whether
           substantially burdens the administration of justice or retards the
           purpose. All these factors are to be taken into account while
           overruling the earlier decision or laying down a new principle.
           The benefit of the decision must be given to the parties before the
           Court even though applied to future cases from that date
           prospectively would not be extended to the parties whose
           adjudication either had become final or matters are pending trial
           or in appeal. [...] This Court would adopt retroactive or non-
           retroactive effect of a decision not as a matter of constitutional
           compulsion but a matter of judicial policy determined in each case
           after evaluating the merits and demerits of the particular case by
           looking to the prior history of the rule in question, its purpose and
           effect and whether retroactive operation will accelerate or retard
           its operation. The reliance on the old rule and the cost of the
           burden of the administration are equally germane and be taken
           into account in deciding to give effect to prospective or
           retrospective operation.”

109. Following the spirit of the discussion in
B. Karunakar
(supra), this Court has

     invoked the doctrine of prospective overruling only when it has been

     appropriate and absolutely necessary to do so. In
K. Madhava Reddy and

     Others v. State of Andhra Pradesh and Others
reported in (2014) 6 SCC 537,

     it was observed that the doctrine of prospective overruling was a rule of judicial

     craftsmanship laced with pragmatism and judicial statesmanship which intends

     to serve as an useful tool, ensuring the smooth transition of the operation of

     law, without unduly affecting the rights of the people who acted upon the law

     which existed or operated previously. In the facts of the case, it was observed

     that the reversion of the petitioner to their parent cadre was bound to have a

     cascading effect which would prejudice several persons who are not even

     parties before the Court. The relevant observations are as follows:
110. On the other hand, in
Justice Chandrashekaraiah (Retired) v. Janekere C.

     Krishna and Others
reported in (2013) 3 SCC 117 while holding that the

     appointment of the Upa-Lokayukta made in the absence of any consultation

     with the Chief Justice was void ab-initio, the Court refused to apply the

     principle of prospective overruling to save the appointment in question. It was

     stated that there was no overwhelming reason to save the appointment from

     attack and the defence that such were the appointments made in the past would

     be of no avail since merely because a wrong had been committed several times

     in the past, would not mean that it must be allowed to persist, otherwise the

     wrong would never be corrected. The relevant observations of this Court are

     reproduced hereinbelow:
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                    Page 127 of 189
111. Yet another decision of this Court in
Union of India v. I.P. Awasthi and Others
reported in (2015) 17 SCC 340 took the view that it would not be appropriate

     to apply the doctrine of prospective overruling when a large number of parties

     are not affected. The doctrine was stated to have been evolved to avoid

     confusion in matters where a large number of parties have settled their affairs

     on account of the overruled law. Since larger public interest was not involved

     in the facts of the case, this Court refrained from applying the said doctrine and

     struck down the amended rule retrospectively. The relevant observations are

     reproduced as thus:
Second, the doctrine of prospective overruling pertains only to the
           powers of this Court. As far as CAT is concerned, we doubt that
           there is any such doctrine available for exercise of its powers. For
           both reasons, we decline the suggestion made.”

                                                   (Emphasis supplied)
112.
In
Union of India and Another v. Ganpati Dealcom Private Limited
reported

     in (2023) 1 SCC 315, it was succinctly explained that the application of the

     doctrine is only a limited exception and must be resorted to when substantial

     actions have been undertaken under the invalid laws such that going back to the

     original position would be next to impossible and observed as thus:
113. Therefore, it is clear as a noon day that the invocation of the doctrine of

     prospective overruling or the attribution of prospectivity to a decision must not

     be resorted to in a routine manner without the Court satisfying itself that the

     circumstances demand such a solution, both to do complete justice to the matter

     at hand and also to reorient the law in the right direction without creating

     widespread chaos and disruption. By employing the doctrine of prospective

     overruling, the matter pending before different forums would still be governed

     under the old law or the overruled decision. In simpler words, the pending cases

     would not be affected by the new declaration of law. In the absence of this the

     Court applying this doctrine, all pending matters and future cases would

     automatically and inescapably be governed by the law declared in the

     overruling decision. In certain situations, it might be preferable on a holistic

     consideration of several competing interests and factors to invoke the doctrine

     of prospective overruling and therefore, it could be said that the ambit of the

     doctrine is co-extensive with the equity of a situation to prevent the intrusion

     into matters which have already been settled or have attained finality. The

     principle involves giving effect to the new law laid down from a prospective

     date, ordinarily from the date of the judgement of the overruling decision.
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                    Page 130 of 189
d.    It would be open for another bench to subsequently decide on the
      application of the doctrine of prospective overruling to a past decision.
115.
In
Saurabh Chaudri (Dr.) and Others v. Union of India and Others
reported

     (2004) 5 SCC 618, a constitutional Bench of this Court decided on the issue of

     the temporal operation of a judgment already declared.
Here, several

     applications were filed seeking clarifications and directions for implementing

     the judgment of a Coordinate Bench of this Court in
Saurabh Chaudri v. Union

     of India
reported in (2003) 11 SCC 146 which concluded that for post-graduate

     (PG) admission to medical colleges, the all-India quota must be increased from

     25% to 50%. The aforesaid decision was rendered on 04.11.2003 but was silent

     both on whether it would be applicable to the process of admissions which had

     already commenced or if it would have prospective application.
In a majority

     opinion, it was declared that the judgement of the Coordinate Bench in
Saurabh
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                   Page 131 of 189
Chaudri
(supra) delivered on 04.11.2003 would be implemented prospectively

     from the academic year 2005-06 since the entire admission procedure for the

     academic year 2004-05 was already planned on the basis of the 25% all-India

     quota. However, S.B. Sinha, J in his minority opinion was of the view that the

     decision must be implemented from the academic year 2004-05 itself since the

     examinations were conducted much after the rendition of the judgment on

     04.11.2003 and any action taken contrary to the decision thereto must be

     considered to be taken by the appropriate authorities at their own peril. The

     relevant observations made by this Court, in its majority opinion, is as follows:
It was not an occasion where an altogether different bench was tasked with

     deciding on the prospective applicability of a previous decision rendered by a

     completely different bench. This question was, however, directly in issue

     before a three-judge bench of this Court in
Jarnail Singh and Others v.

     Lachhmi Narain Gupta and Others
reported in (2022) 10 SCC 595.
Herein,

     one of the issues was whether the judgment in
M. Nagaraj v. Union of India
reported in (2006) 8 SCC 212 could be said to operate prospectively.
M.

     Nagaraj
(supra) upheld the constitutional validity of
Article 16(4-A)
subject to

     the State collecting quantifiable data showing inadequate representation. The

     law laid down therein applied from 17.06.1995 i.e., the date on which
Article

     16(4-A)
came into force.
While agreeing with the contention that the decision

     in
M. Nagaraj
(supra) must be given prospective effect from the date of its

     decision on 19.10.2006, the Court referred to the US Supreme Court decision

     in Victor Linkletter v. Victor G. Walker reported in 1965 SCC OnLine US SC

     126 where an earlier judgement of the US Supreme Court in Mapp v. Ohio

     reported in 367 U.S. 643 was declared to be prospective in operation after

     considering the consequences that will ensue with its retrospective operation.

     With a view to avoid any confusion, and also to prevent the debilitating effect

     that it would have had on a very large number of employees, the Court declared

     that a prior judgment of this Court can be made prospectively applicable by a
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                   Page 135 of 189
different or even a smaller bench of this Court subsequently, in exercise of the

     power to do complete justice under
Article 142.
Furthermore, it was held that

     it would not be an absolute rule that prospective overruling or the prospective

     operation of a decision must be declared only by the bench which has rendered

     the decision in question.
The contrary view taken by this Court in
M.A. Murthy

     v. State of Karnataka
reported in (2003) 7 SCC 517 that there shall be no

     prospective overruling unless indicated in the “particular decision” was

     declared to be obiter and not binding.
Therefore, the three-judge bench in
Jarnail Singh
(supra) declared the decision of the five-judge Constitution

     Bench in
M. Nagaraj
(supra) to have prospective operation. The relevant

     observations are as thus:
119. In State of Kerala and Others v. Alassery Mohammed and Others reported in

     (1978) 2 SCC 386, the issue pertained to whether non-compliance with the

     requirement of Rule 22 of the Prevention of Food Adulteration Rules, 1955

     would vitiate the entire trial and the conviction recorded therein.
While this

     Court’s decision in
Rajal Das Guru Namal Pamanani v. State of Maharashtra
reported in (1975) 3 SCC 375 held that the quantities mentioned under the said

     rule are required for a correct analysis and any shortage in the said quantity is
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                         Page 137 of 189
not permitted by the Statute, however, Alassery (supra) held that if the quantity

     sent to the Public Analyst, even though less than prescribed, is sufficient and

     enables the Public Analyst to make a correct analysis, then merely because the

     quantity sent was not in strict compliance with the Rule will not result in the

     nullification of the report and obliterate its evidentiary value. This was held by

     keeping in mind that it would endanger public health to acquit offenders on

     technical grounds which have no substance.
However since
Pamanani
(supra)

     had held the field for a significant time and several prosecutions had resulted

     in acquittals in the meantime, the Court found it fit to dispose of the appeals by

     only laying down the correct proposition of law. Neither were the acquittals of

     any of the respondents set aside nor were their cases sent back to the Courts

     below. The relevant observations are reproduced hereinbelow:
Decision in many of them became final and only a few could be
           brought to this Court. Each one of the Food Inspectors concerned
           had failed in discharging his duty strictly in accordance with the
           requirements of the law, and, in such a situation, after great
           harassment, long delay, and expenses which the respondents had
           to incur, they should not be punished by this Court.
18. In the three Kerala cases Mr S.V. Gupte appearing with Mr
           K.R. Nambiar and Mr Sudhakaran stated before us that the State
           was interested more in the correct enunciation of the law than in
           seeing that the respondents in these appeals are convicted. They
           were not anxious to prosecute these matters to obtain ultimate
           conviction of the respondents. A large number of the other appeals
           are by the Municipal Corporation of Delhi for whom the Attorney
           General appeared assisted by Mr B.P. Maheshwari. Although a
           categorical stand was not taken on behalf of the appellants in these
           appeals as the one taken in the Kerala cases, eventually, the
           learned Attorney General did not seriously object to the course
           indicated by us. In the few Bombay appeals M/s V.S. Desai and
           M.N. Shroff showed their anxiety for obtaining ultimate
           convictions of the offenders, but we do not find sufficient reason
           for passing a different kind of order in the Bombay appeals.
In
           similar situations in the case of
State of Bihar v. Hiralal
           Kejriwal
[AIR 1960 SC 47 : (1960) 1 SCR 726 : 1960 Cri LJ 150]
           this Court refused to exercise its discretionary jurisdiction under
Article 136
of the Constitution and did not order the continuance
           of the criminal proceeding any further.
In
Food Inspector, Calicut
           Corporation v. Cherukattil Gopalan
[(1971) 2 SCC 322 : 1971
           SCC (Cri) 522 : 1971 Supp SCR 721] this Court said at p. 730 :
120. In Alassery (supra), there was no mention of the doctrine of prospective

     overruling being applied to the facts of the case. What was done was that the
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                   Page 139 of 189
Court refrained from setting aside the acquittals of any of the respondents

     therein or sending their cases back for re-trial to the appropriate court or

     convicting any of the respondents therein by an order of the Court itself.

     However, there was no mention as regards matters which may have been

     pending before a trial court and which required a consideration of this issue.
This may have been so because Rule 22-B which was introduced three years

     after the decision in
Pamanani
(supra) clarified the position of law
laid down

     in
Pamanani
(supra) by stating that “Notwithstanding anything contained in

     Rule 22, the quantity of sample sent for analysis shall be considered as

     sufficient unless the public analyst or the Director reports to the contrary”.

     Therefore, it was more likely that all the pending matters came to be instituted

     only after Rule 22-B was introduced and there remained no doubt on the

     position of law since. Therefore, this Court confined itself to making an

     observation relating to the acquittals alone i.e., that the acquittals would not be

     interfered with.
However, if in case, there existed a matter, instituted before the

     trial court, before Rule 22-B came into being and was concerned with the same

     question, the decision in Alassery (supra) could be said to have been applicable

     to it retrospectively.
121. The applicability or discussion relating to the doctrine of prospective overruling

     can be noticed in a few other matters under the criminal arena, though
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                     Page 140 of 189
prominently on matters pertaining to procedural law.
In
Ramesh Kumar Soni

     v. State of Madhya Pradesh
reported in (2013) 14 SCC 696, the Court was

     concerned with an amendment changing the triability of certain offences i.e.,

     from the Judicial Magistrate First Class to the Court of Session and its effect

     on the cases pending trial or pending investigation. This Court had held that

     any amendment shifting the forum of the trial had to be, on principle,

     retrospective in nature in the absence of any indication to the contrary in the

     Amendment Act. This retrospective operation of amendments relating to

     procedure would be subject to the exception that the earlier procedure which

     was correctly adopted and which led to the proceedings being concluded under

     the old law cannot be reopened for the purpose of applying the new procedure.

     Furthermore, it was also reiterated that an accused does not possess a “vested

     right of forum” for his trial. However, the decision of a Full Bench of the

     Madhya Pradesh High Court in Amendment of First Schedule of
Criminal

     Procedure Code
by Criminal Procedure Code (M.P. Amendment) Act, 2007,

     In re, reported in (2008) SCC OnLine MP 185 had opined that all the cases

     which were pending before the Judicial Magistrate as on 22.02.2008 i.e., the

     date of the amendment, would remain unaffected by the Amendment.

     Therefore, the Full Bench of the High Court directed that all the cases which

     were pending before the Judicial Magistrate and had already been committed

     to the Court of Session due to the coming into force of the amendment, to be
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                  Page 141 of 189
sent back to the Judicial Magistrate.
This Court in
Ramesh Kumar Soni
(supra)

     disagreed and overruled the decision of the Full Bench but only prospectively.

     This was done because the trial of the cases that were sent back from the

     Sessions Court to the Judicial Magistrate under the orders of the Full Bench

     may have also been concluded or may be at an advanced stage. Therefore, any

     change of forum at that stage would have caused unnecessary and avoidable

     hardship to the accused if they were transferred again to the Court of Sessions

     in light of the conclusion that an amendment to procedural law would operate

     retrospectively. The relevant observations are reproduced hereinbelow:
122. On a conspectus of the aforesaid discussion on the doctrine of prospective

     overruling, the following can be summarised:
ix.   One another decision on the doctrine of prospective overruling which

         pertains to criminal law was rendered in
Ramesh Kumar Soni
(supra).
Herein, this Court overruled the decision of the Full Bench of the High

         Court prospectively, by stating that any change of forum at this stage

         would cause unnecessary and avoidable hardship to the accused if they

         were transferred again in light of the conclusion arrived at in
Ramesh

         Kumar Soni
(supra).
123. In light of the elaborate discussion hereinabove, we do not find it necessary, in

     the facts and circumstances of the matter at hand, to exercise the powers

     available to us and declare the decision given in Sanjeev V. Deshpande (supra)

     to be prospectively applicable. We have decided so because there exists no

     overwhelming reason for us to apply the doctrine of prospective overruling. On
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                    Page 148 of 189
the other hand, in order to meet the ends of justice and with a view to ensure

     that public interest is safeguarded and to give effect to the salutary object

     behind the enactment of the
NDPS Act
, the decision must necessarily be

     retrospectively applicable. This Court in Sanjeev V. Deshpande (supra),

     perhaps, did not think fit to confine or restrict its interpretation of
Section 8
of

     the NDPS Act to future cases only.
This is evinced from the fact that whilst

     overruling Rajesh Kumar Gupta (supra), it deliberately chose not to discuss

     the doctrine of prospective overruling let alone resort to it. This conspicuous

     silence in
Sanjeev Deshpande
(supra) as regards the prospective or

     retrospective effect of overruling Rajesh Kumar Gupta (supra) has to be borne

     in mind and given due deference. As a natural corollary to the aforesaid, we see

     no reason why we should deviate from the default rule of retrospectivity and

     instead, resort to the doctrine of prospective overruling.
Therefore, pending

     cases, if any, which were instituted before the decision of this Court in Sanjeev

     V. Deshpande (supra) would also be governed by the law as clarified by it.



f.
Article 20(1)
considerations on the retrospective applicability of the
     decision in Sanjeev V. Deshpande (supra).
126. A reflection of this proposition laid down by Salmond was evident in the

     decision of the Indiana Supreme Court, way back in the year 1898, in Center

     School Township v. State reported in 150 Ind. 168., which discussed the effect

     of the overruling of a decision. It was held that a decision of a court of last

     resort, is only an exposition of what the court “construes the law to be”,

     therefore, while overruling a former decision, the court does not declare the

     overruled decision to be bad in law, but that it was “never the law”. The

     overruling would be indicative of the fact that the court was simply mistaken

     in regard to the law in its former decision and it would have the effect of

     obliterating the former decision altogether. However, it was cautioned that
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                    Page 151 of 189
courts will not apply a change made by the overruling decision to the

     construction of the law given in the overruled decision, so as to invade the

     vested rights of any person. The relevant observations are reproduced

     hereinbelow:
127. The aforementioned decision reiterates that any decision of a court would only

     be an evidence or an exposition of what the court construes the law to be and

     this is precisely why the overruling decision would remove any authoritative

     value that the overruled decision might have had, even during the intervening

     period. Center School Township (supra) also clarified that the vested right, if

     any, which is sought to be protected as an exception to the retrospective

     application of the overruling decision, must be real. They must be rights of

     property or those founded on contracts, express or implied. For example, say a

     right has arisen on a contract or a transaction in the nature of a contract which

     is authorised by a statute and the statute concerned, is repealed. In such a

     scenario, a vested right would exist independently of the repealed statute. It was

     also held that the vested right must be something more than a mere expectation

     based upon an anticipated continuance of the existing law.
129. A constitutional Bench of this Court in
Rao Shiv Bahadur Singh and Another

     v. State of Vindhya Pradesh
reported in (1953) 2 SCC 111 was concerned with

     the invocation of
Article 20(1)
with respect to a pre-Constitution ex-post facto

     law and held that
Article 20(1)
prohibits all convictions or subjections to

     penalty, after the Constitution, in respect of ex-post facto laws, irrespective of

     whether the same was a post-Constitution or a pre-Constitution law. Herein, the

     Vindhya Pradesh Ordinance 48 of 1949, though enacted on 11.09.1949, i.e.,

     after the alleged offences in the case therein were committed, was made

     retrospective and deemed to have been in force from 09.08.1948. It was
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                     Page 154 of 189
therefore, urged that the Ordinance was a “law in force” during the time the

     offences were committed and would not be hit by
Article 20.
However, this

     Court disagreed with such a contention and said that to accept such an argument

     would be to give a hyper-technical meaning to the words “law in force”. If it

     were accepted then the very purpose of
Article 20
would be defeated since any

     ex-post facto law could be given retrospective effect by the legislature to

     overcome the rigours of
Article 20.
It was this Court’s opinion that “law in

     force” must be understood as being the law in fact in existence and in operation

     at the time of commission of the offence as distinct from the law “deemed” to

     have become operative by virtue of the power of the legislature to pass

     retrospective laws. The relevant observations are reproduced hereinbelow:
130. On the other hand, the issue in question before this Court in
Soni Devrajbhai

     Babubhai v. State of Gujarat
reported in (1991) 4 SCC 298 related to the

     insertion of Section 304-B to the
IPC
, 1860 w.e.f. 19.11.1986 which created a

     new substantive offence more stringent than
Section 498-A
IPC. The incident

     in question in the case occurred prior to 19.11.1986 and therefore, the accused

     were tried under Section 498-A instead of Section 304-B since their trial under

     the latter provision would be hit by
Article 20(1).
While affirming the view

     taken by the High Court, it was elaborated that, it was Section 498-A which

     was in the statute book when the incident occurred. The offence punishable

     under Section 304-B, known as dowry death, was inserted into the statute books

     only after the offence had been committed. Another indication that a new

     offence was “created” was that
Section 304-B
IPC is punishable with a

     minimum sentence of seven years which may extend to life imprisonment and

     was triable by a Court of Session whereas
Section 498-A
IPC is triable by a

     Magistrate of the First Class and is punishable for a term which may extend to

     three years in addition to a fine. The relevant observations are reproduced

     below:
131. Another Constitutional Bench of this Court in
Central Bureau of Investigation

     v. R.R. Kishore
reported in (2023) 15 SCC 339 was faced with the issue

     whether the declaration of
Section 6-A
of the DSPE Act, 1946 as

     unconstitutional by the judgment rendered in
Subramanian Swamy v.

     Director, Central Bureau of Investigation and Another
reported in (2014) 8

     SCC 682 led to the creation of a new offence, which had the effect of causing

     implications on the fundamental right guaranteed under
Article 20(1)
of the

     Constitution, and also whether the declaration of unconstitutionality must be

     given prospective effect. This Court held that the declaration of Section 6-A as

     unconstitutional would not have any implications as far as fundamental rights

     are concerned since the provision purely related to a procedural aspect.

     Furthermore, since the declaration of a provision as unconstitutional goes to the

     root of it and makes it void ab initio and non-est, it’s effect would be

     retrospective in nature. In declaring so, the Bench elaborated on the following

     aspects:
The relevant observations are reproduced hereinbelow:
in Phillips v. Eyre [Phillips v. Eyre, (1870) LR 6 QB 1 at pp. 23
              and 25] and of the United States Supreme Court
              in Calder v. Bull [Calder v. Bull, 1 L Ed 648 at p. 649 : 3 Dall
              386 : 3 US 386 (1798)] , to hold that it would be highly unjust,
              unfair and in violation of human rights to punish a person under
              the ex post facto law for acts or omissions that were not an
              offence when committed. [...]
39.
Rao Shiv Bahadur Singh [Rao Shiv Bahadur Singh v. State
              of Vindhya Pradesh
, (1953) 2 SCC 111 : 1953 SCR 1188]
              observes that the language of clause (1) of
Article 20
of the
              Constitution is much wider in terms as the prohibition under the
              article is not confined to the passing of validity of the law, and
              that fullest effect must be given to the actual words used and
              what they convey. Accordingly, the decision had struck down
              Vidhya Pradesh Ordinance 48 of 1949, which though enacted
              on 11-9-1949, had postulated that the provisions would deemed
              to have come into force in Vidhya Pradesh on 9-4-1948, a date
              prior to the date of commission of offences. Interpreting the
              term “law in force”, it was held that the Ordinance giving
              retrospective effect would not fall within the meaning of the
              phrase “law in force” as used in clause (1) of
Article 20
of the
              Constitution. The “law in force” must be taken to relate not to
              a law deemed to be in force, but factually in force, and then only
              it will fall within the meaning of “existing law”. Artifice or
              fiction will fall foul, when they are with the intent to defeat the
              salutary object and purpose behind clause (1) of
Article 20
of
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                     Page 161 of 189
the Constitution. [In the present case, we need not examine
              when an offence is a continuous offence, an aspect and matter
              of considerable debate.]

                             xxx            xxx          xxx
132. The background and context under which we are examining the applicability

     of
Article 20(1)
to the facts of our case are quite different and distinguishable.

     We are not concerned with a situation where the legislature or another

     competent authority had once enacted a provision/rule wherein the dealing of

     substances only mentioned in Schedule I of the NDPS Rules, would constitute

     an offence and the same later came to be substituted with a provision/rule which

     stated that the dealing in of all substances mentioned under the
Schedule to the

     Act
would also constitute an offence under
Section 8
. It is just that the position

     of law was assumed to be so in Rajesh Kumar Gupta (supra), however, that

     conclusion was expressly declared as wrong in
Sanjeev V Deshpande
(supra).
The three-judge Bench in
Sanjeev V Deshpande
(supra) while overruling

     Rajesh Kumar Gupta (supra) went to the extent of saying that Rajesh Kumar

     Gupta (supra) ignored the mandate of
Section 8(c)
of the NDPS Act and that it

     was wrongly decided. Therefore, the intention of the legislature along with the

     true import and meaning of
Section 8(c)
read with the relevant rules was always

     that the dealing in of any psychotropic substance mentioned under the
Schedule

     to the Act
in contravention of the provisions of the Act and Rules framed

     thereunder, must necessarily be punished.
The consistent line of decisions of
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                     Page 163 of 189
this Court, as elaborated by us in the preceding parts of this judgment, which

     pre-existed the decision in Rajesh Kumar Gupta (supra) and which also

     support the conclusion reached by
Sanjeev V Deshpande
(supra) and by us,

     serve as a testament to the undoubted position of law contained in the
NDPS

     Act
and its Rules, in this regard.
133. Furthermore, we are also not concerned with a scenario wherein the language

     of
Section 8
of the NDPS Act is visibly narrow and through the act of judicial

     interpretation, an unreasonably wide or expansive interpretation has been

     accorded to it by the decision in
Sanjeev V Deshpande
(supra) and also by us.

     On the contrary, it is our opinion that the construction to
Section 8
of the NDPS

     Act was inordinately restricted in Rajesh Kumar Gupta (supra) when the scope

     and ambit of the provision was clear in itself.
Hence, the decision in
Sanjeev V

     Deshpande
(supra) taken along with the elaborate discussion which we have

     engaged in on the position of law, has only served to clarify the true meaning

     as exactly reflected in the statute, without any undue narrowing or expansion.
Therefore, there is no doubt in our mind while clarifying that the decision in
Sanjeev V Deshpande
(supra) overruling the decision in Rajesh Kumar Gupta

     (supra) would have retrospective effect, that there would arise no adverse

     implications as regards the
Article 20(1)
rights which the accused persons are

     otherwise entitled to.
136. The decisions of this Court in
Rao Shiv Bahadur Singh
(supra),
Soni

     Devrajbhai Babubhai
(supra) and
R.R. Kishore
(supra) would not in any

     manner be an impediment to the above conclusion since – First, in
Rao Shiv

     Bahadur Singh
(supra), it was opined that the expression “law in force” must

     be understood as being the law in fact in existence and in operation at the time

     of commission of the offence as distinct from the law “deemed” to have become

     operative by virtue of the power of the legislature to pass retrospective laws.

     The same is inapplicable herein since; (a) we are not dealing with a situation

     where the legislature has introduced a new offence which is sought to be

     retrospectively enforced and (b) the overruling of a decision and the declaration

     of the right meaning of law is not attributed to the provision by the overruling

     court through a “deeming fiction”. The overruling decision only mirrors what

     the lawmakers wanted the law to be and what it always was. Therefore, it

     cannot be disputed that the interpretation given in the overruling decision was

     infallibly the “law in force” at all times.
Secondly, in
Soni Devrajbhai

     Babubhai
(supra), it was apparent that the offences were traceable to two

     different provisions, the latter of which created a distinct offence and entered

     into the statute books much later in time. Therefore, it could be said without
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                    Page 167 of 189
any doubt that a new offence was “created”.
Thirdly, in
R.R. Kishore
(supra).
138.
In
Somaiya
(supra), this Court had emphasized that it cannot be said that the

     past actions would be validated when the doctrine of prospective overruling is

     resorted to. Therefore, the idea is not to declare all the actions that were taken

     contrary to law or in pursuance of an unconstitutional provision as valid, but to

     save those transactions on a balance of considerations.
Similarly, if the accused

     before us had been acquitted directly as a consequence of the decision in Rajesh

     Kumar Gupta (supra), the same cannot be said to have been made in

     accordance with law. Although, we have expressed our intention to not disturb

     any acquittal made in the past, which have attained finality, if the accused

     persons before us were acquitted by the respective Trial Courts due to the

     interpretation given in Rajesh Kumar Gupta (supra) and after an examination

     of materials placed on record, we were satisfied that the accused before us were

     indeed guilty of the offence with which they were charged, we could have held

     them “technically guilty” of the offence under
Section 8
of the NDPS Act.
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                     Page 169 of 189
139. This concept of “technical guilt” found mention in the decision of this Court in
Food Inspector, Calicut Corporation v. Cherukattil Gopalan and Another
reported in (1971) 2 SCC 322. Here, the issue was whether the respondent

     running a tea-stall could be said to have “sold” the sugar to the Food Inspector

     under
Section 2(xiii)
of the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act, 1954 and

     hence fall under the ambit of
Sections 7
and
16(1)(a)(i)
of the Act which

     prohibits and punishes the manufacture, sale etc. of adulterated articles of food.

     The counsel for the appellant had, during the course of the arguments, made it

     clear that the appellant did not want the respondents to be convicted in case his

     contentions were accepted and that the Corporation only wished to clarify the

     legal position on the aforesaid issue. In conclusion, while this Court agreed with

     the contentions of the appellant, the respondents were only held to be

     “technically guilty” of the offence with which they were charged and this Court

     opined that they had been wrongly acquitted by the High Court and the Trial

     Court respectively. The relevant observations are reproduced below:
144. The Court may alter or add to any charge either upon its own motion or on an

     application by the parties concerned. Therefore, such a power can be invoked

     by the Court suo moto as well. This power under
Section 216
CrPC is exclusive

     to the concerned Court and no party can seek such an addition or alteration of

     charge as a matter of right by filing an application. It would be the Trial Court

     which must decide whether a proper charge has been framed or not, at the

     appropriate stage of the trial. On a consideration of the broad probabilities of
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                    Page 173 of 189
the case, the total effect of the evidence and documents adduced, the Trial Court

     must satisfy itself that the exercise of power under Section 216 is necessary.

     The provision has been enacted with the salutary object to ensure a fair and full

     trial to the accused person(s) in each case.
145. This Court in
Anant Prakash Sinha v. State of Haryana and Another
reported

     in (2016) 6 SCC 105 summarised the principles as regards
Section 216
CrPC.

     Herein, charges were framed against the appellant-husband for the commission

     of offences punishable under
Sections 498-A
and
323
IPC. During the

     pendency of the matter, the informant wife had filed an application under
Section 216
CrPC for framing an additional charge under
Section 406
IPC

     against both the husband and the mother-in-law on the ground that there was

     an express complaint with regard to the misappropriation of her entire Stridhan

     and other articles. Hence, it was contended that the accused persons had

     committed criminal breach of trust, however, a charge sheet was not filed in

     respect of the said offence. The application was allowed by the Trial Court and

     subsequently, the Revisional Court upheld the framing of charge under
Section

     406
IPC only against the appellant-husband. This Court while agreeing with

     the High Court summarised the principles underlying
Section 216
CrPC as

     follows:
147. P. Ramanatha Aiyar in his Law Lexicon (6th Edn.) defined “alter” as “to make

     a change in; to modify; to vary in some degree”. “Alteration” is defined as a
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                    Page 177 of 189
“change or substitution of one thing for another”. Further, it has been

     elaborated that the term “alter” is to be distinguished from its synonyms i.e.,

     “change” and “amend”. To change something may import the substitution of

     an entirely different thing, while on the other hand, to alter would be to operate

     upon a subject matter which continues to be the same objectively while just

     modified in some particular. To illustrate it better in the context of charging an

     accused with an offence, let’s say an accused is charged with an offence

     initially under
Section 323
IPC for simple hurt. If the Trial Court is of the

     opinion that the case is in fact one of grievous hurt, it may alter the charge of

     the accused for an offence under
Section 325
IPC. This would be an alteration

     since the broad subject matter continues to be the same. Further, to amend

     would imply that the modification made in the subject improves it, which might

     not necessarily be the case with an alteration. In other words, an amendment

     may involve an alteration but an alteration does not always amend.
148.
In
Sohan Lal and Others v. State of Rajasthan
reported in (1990) 4 SCC 580,

     this Court while holding that an application under Section 216 would not be

     maintainable against persons who have already been discharged, elaborated the

     meaning of the words “alter and add to” as follows:
149. Therefore, to alter a charge would be to vary an existing charge and make a

     different charge. Hence, when the Court exercises its power under Section 216,

     either on its own motion or on an application made by the parties, and “alters”

     a charge, it would be necessary that the existing charge be varied and a new

     charge be made. In the instant case, in Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013, the

     Trial Court in its order dated 30.11.2006 had held that the charge framed by his

     predecessor for the offence under
Sections 8
,
22
and
29
of the NDPS Act had

     not been made out and that the case of the accused had to be a case under the

     D&C Act which would be triable by the Metropolitan Magistrate. In Criminal

     Appeal No. 272 of 2014, again, the Trial Court in its order dated 17.04.2010

     similarly held that the offences under
Sections 8
and
22
of the NDPS Act were

     not made out and the matter would fall within the rigours of the D&C Act.
152.
In a recent decision of this Court in
K. Ravi v. State of Tamil Nadu and

     Another
reported in 2024 SCC OnLine SC 2283, this Court had categorically

     observed that Section 216 does not give any right to the accused to file a fresh

     application seeking discharge after the charge has been framed by the Court.

     Herein, several accused were charge-sheeted under
Sections 147
,
148
,
323
,
324
,
307
and
302
of the IPC respectively. The respondent no. 2 - accused filed

     an application for discharge under
Section 227
CrPC which was dismissed by

     the Sessions Court. After charges were framed, the respondent no.2 along with

     the other accused then filed an application under
Section 216
CrPC seeking

     alteration of charge, which was also dismissed. In revision, the High Court,

     however, set aside the charge framed against the respondent no. 2. While

     holding that an accused cannot seek a discharge under the garb of

     modification/alteration of charge through a Section 216 application, this Court
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                   Page 180 of 189
also highlighted that it has become routine practice for the accused to file an

     application under
Section 216
CrPC after their application for discharge under
Section 227
CrPC is dismissed, sometimes in ignorance of the law but also on

     other occasions with the sole intent of derailing the trial. The relevant

     observations are as thus:
153. A few High Courts have also rightly taken the view that an application under
Section 216
CrPC cannot lead to the deletion of charge or the discharge of an

     accused.
In a relatively recent decision of the High Court of Allahabad in
Dev

     Narain v. State of U.P. and Another
reported in 2023 SCC OnLine All 3216,

     it was stated that a prayer for discharge cannot be sustained in an application

     under
Section 216
CrPC. Herein the sole-accused moved an application for

     discharge and the same was rejected. The application under
Section 482
CrPC

     filed before the High Court was also dismissed but with the observation that “it

     is open to the applicant to move an application for alteration of charge under
Section 216
CrPC before the Trial Court”. Charges were framed against the

     accused under
Sections 498-A
,
304-B
,
323
IPC and
Sections 3
and
4
of the

     Dowry prohibition Act, 1961. After the evidence of PW-1 was recorded, the

     accused moved an application under
Section 216
CrPC for alteration of charge

     and the same also came to be dismissed by the Trial Court. The High Court

     stated that the alteration of charge and deletion of charge hold different field

     and that these two cannot be intermingled. A perusal of the prayer made by the

     accused in the 216
CrPC
application indicated that it was, in essence, a prayer

     for discharge and quashing of the charges levelled against him. Therefore, it

     was held that such a power to delete charges is not conferred on the Court under
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                   Page 182 of 189
Section 216
CrPC. It was added that a charge once framed, it must lead either

     to an acquittal or conviction at the end of the trial and charges cannot be

     permitted to be deleted mid-trial. The relevant observations are reproduced

     hereinbelow:
I am in agreement with this conclusion. The petitioner is seeking
           the deletion of a charge of conspiracy altogether that is not
           permissible under Section 216 of the Code. The charge once
           framed must lead to either acquittal or conviction at the
           conclusion of trial. Section 216 of the Code does not permit the
           deletion of the same. Subsequently, Delhi High Court in the case
           of
Verghese Stephen v. Central Bureau Of Investigation
, 2007 Cri
           LJ 4080, placed reliance on aforesaid judgment of this Court in
           the case of
Vibhuti Narayan Chaubey
(supra).”

                                                   (Emphasis supplied)
158. There arises no occasion for us to declare the interpretation given to
Section 8
of the NDPS Act and the relevant NDPS Rules, by the decision in Sanjeev V.

     Deshpande (supra), as prospectively applicable. There exists no overwhelming

     reason for us to do so. On the other hand, in order to meet the ends of justice

     and with a view to ensure that public interest is safeguarded and to give effect

     to the salutary object behind the enactment of the
NDPS Act
, the decision must

     necessarily be retrospectively applicable. This Court in Sanjeev V. Deshpande

     (supra), perhaps, did not think fit to confine or restrict its interpretation of
Section 8
of the NDPS Act to future cases only.
This is evinced from the fact
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                   Page 186 of 189
that whilst overruling Rajesh Kumar Gupta (supra), it deliberately chose not

     to discuss the doctrine of prospective overruling let alone resort to it. This

     conspicuous silence in
Sanjeev Deshpande
(supra) as regards the prospective

     or retrospective effect of overruling Rajesh Kumar Gupta (supra) has to be

     borne in mind and given due deference. As a natural corollary to the aforesaid,

     we see no reason why we should deviate from the default rule of retrospectivity

     and instead, resort to the doctrine of prospective overruling.
Therefore, pending

     cases, if any, which were instituted before the decision of this Court in Sanjeev

     V. Deshpande (supra) would also be governed by the law as clarified by it.
160. However, having held that the decision in Sanjeev V. Deshpande (supra) must

     be given retrospective effect, we find it necessary to clarify that acquittals

     which have already been recorded as a consequence of the decision in Rajesh

     Kumar Gupta (supra) and have attained finality, would not be unsettled in light

     of the overruling decision in Sanjeev V. Deshpande (supra) or the observations

     made by us.

State, exporting inter-State, importing into India, exporting from India or

     transhipment of any narcotic drug or psychotropic substance, except for

     medical or scientific purposes and in the manner and to the extent provided

     by the provisions of this Act or the rules or orders made thereunder.
29. It was then submitted that
Section 80
of the NDPS Act provides that the

     provisions of the
NDPS Act
and Rules made thereunder, shall be in addition to,

     and not in derogation of the D&C Act, 1940 or the Rules made thereunder.

     Therefore, the High Court wrongly held that the psychotropic substance in the

     present case is governed exclusively by the D&C Act without attracting an

     offence under the
NDPS Act
.
a.
Object of the NDPS Act
and the United Nations Convention on
       Psychotropic Substances, 1971.
39. Before we advert to the rival submissions canvassed on either side, it would be

      apposite to first look into the object and history behind the enactment of the
NDPS Act
and its Rules along with the broad scheme of the United Nations

      Convention on Psychotropic Substances, 1971.
However, with the passage of time and the development in the field
           of illicit drug traffic and during abuse at national and
           international level, many deficiencies in the existing laws have
           come to notice. Therefore, in order to remove such deficiencies
           and difficulties, there was urgent need for the enactment of a
           comprehensive legislation on narcotic drugs and psychotropic
           substances, which led to enactment of the
NDPS Act
. As observed
           hereinabove, the Act is a special law and has a laudable purpose
           to serve and is intended to combat the menace otherwise bent upon
           destroying the public health and national health. The guilty must
           be in and the innocent ones must be out. The punishment part in
           drug trafficking is an important one but its preventive part is more
           important. Therefore, prevention of illicit traffic in the
Narcotic
           Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985
came to be
           introduced. The aim was to prevent illicit traffic rather than punish
           after the offence was committed. Therefore, the courts will have to
           safeguard the life and liberty of the innocent persons. Therefore,
           the provisions of the
NDPS Act
are required to be interpreted
           keeping in mind the object and purpose of the
NDPS Act
; impact
           on the society as a whole and the Act is required to be interpreted
           literally and not liberally which may ultimately frustrate the
           object, purpose and Preamble of the Act [...].”

44.
Article 1(e)
of the Convention defines a “psychotropic substance” as any

     substance, natural or synthetic, or any natural material in Schedules I, II, III or

     IV of the Convention.
Article 4
provides that, as regards the substances other

     than those mentioned in Schedule I i.e., in Schedule II, II and IV respectively,

     the States may permit – (a) the carrying by international travellers of small

     quantities of lawfully obtained preparations for personal use; (b) the use of such

     psychotropic substances in industry for the manufacture of non-psychotropic

     substances or products subject to the application of control measures until the

     psychotropic substances come to be in such a condition that they will not be

     abused or recovered in practice; and (c) the use of such psychotropic substances

     for the capture of animals by specifically authorised persons subject to the

     application of control measures.
Article 5
, in addition, states that the

     manufacture, export, import, distribution, stocking, trade, use and possession,

     of substances in Schedules II, III and IV respectively, must be limited to

     medical and scientific purposes, except for those purposes already enumerated

     under
Article 4.
Furthermore,
Article 5
states that it would be desirable if States
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                       Page 34 of 189
do not permit the possession of substances mentioned in Schedules II, III and

      IV respectively, except under legal authority.
45.   As per
Article 8
, the manufacture of, trade in, and distribution of substances

      listed in Schedules II, III and IV respectively, must also be under a licence or

      other similar control measures, provided that the requirements of licencing or

      other control measures need not apply to persons who are duly authorised to

      perform or are performing therapeutic or scientific functions.
Article 9
states

      that the substances in Schedules II, III and IV respectively, shall be supplied or

      dispensed for use by individuals only pursuant to a medical prescription except

      when being lawfully obtained, used, dispensed or administered in the duly

      authorised exercise of therapeutic or scientific functions.
46. In so far as the substances mentioned in Schedule I are concerned,
Articles 4
and
7
respectively state that their use shall be prohibited except for scientific

      and very limited medical purposes, by duly authorized persons in medical or

      scientific establishments, which are either directly under the control of the

      government or specifically approved by them. Such persons performing

      medical or scientific functions must be required to maintain records concerning

      the acquisition of the substances and the details of their use which must be
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                       Page 35 of 189
preserved for at least two years after the last use recorded therein. States must

     also require that the manufacture, trade, distribution and possession of Schedule

     I substances be under a special licence or prior authorization and be closely

     supervised. The quantity of Schedule I substances supplied to a duly authorised

     person must also be restricted to such level as required for his authorized

     purpose. The export and import of Schedule I substances shall be prohibited

     except when both the exporter and importer are the competent authorities or

     agencies of the exporting or importing country, or other persons or enterprises

     which are specifically authorised for that purpose. During the export and import

     as enumerated above, the authorities or persons specifically authorized must

     have export and import authorizations for the substances mentioned in

     Schedule I.
48.
Article 12
elaborates on the provisions relating to international trade and states

     that every State permitting the export or import of substances in Schedules I or

     II respectively, shall require a separate import or export authorization which

     shall state the international non-proprietary name or the designation of the

     substance in the Schedule, the quantity to be exported or imported, the

     pharmaceutical form, the name and address of the exporter and importer, and

     the period within which the export or import must be effected. Additionally,

     the export authorization shall also state the number and date of the import

     authorization and the authority by whom it has been issued. Before an export
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                       Page 37 of 189
authorization is issued, the States shall require an import authorization issued

     by the competent authority of the importing country or region which certifies

     that the importing of the substance(s) referred to therein is approved and such

     an authorization shall be produced by the person or establishment while

     applying for the export authorization. A copy of the export authorisation is to

     accompany each consignment and the government issuing the export

     authorisation shall also send a copy to the government of the importing country

     or region. When the importation has been effected, the government of the

     importing country or region shall then return the export authorization to the

     government of the exporting country or region, with an endorsement certifying

     the amount of the substance which has actually been imported.
51.   On a closer look at the substances mentioned in the Schedules to the

      Convention, it is evident that Buprenorphine and its salt Buprenorphine

      Hydrochloride is listed under Schedule III. Therefore, according to the scheme

      of the Convention, the manufacture, distribution, stocking, and possession of

      Buprenorphine and its salt Buprenorphine Hydrochloride shall be limited to

      medical and scientific purposes in addition to the limited purposes as provided

      in
Article 4.
The Convention casts a mandate upon States that the manufacture

      of, trade in and distribution of Buprenorphine and its salt Buprenorphine

      Hydrochloride be under a licence or other similar control measure. The only

      exception being that such a licence or other control measure need not

      necessarily apply to persons who are duly authorised to perform therapeutic or

      scientific functions.
b.     Relevant Statutory Provisions of the NDPS Act and its Rules
52.
Section 2(xxiii)
of the NDPS Act defines a “Psychotropic substance” as –

            “any substance, natural or synthetic, or any natural material or
            any salt or preparation of such substance or material included in
            the list of psychotropic substances specified in the Schedule”
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                        Page 40 of 189
A bare reading of the definition would indicate that all items listed in

     the
Schedule to the Act
along with its salts and preparations come within the

     purview of a “psychotropic substance” under the
NDPS Act
.
53.
Section 8
of the NDPS Act prohibits certain operations and reads as thus:
54.   The mandate under
Section 8
is that no person shall produce, manufacture,

      possess, sell, purchase, transport, warehouse, use, consume, import inter-State,

      export inter-State, import into India, export from India or tranship (hereinafter

      collectively referred to as “deal in/dealing in”) any narcotic drug or

      psychotropic substance, except for medical or scientific purposes and in the

      manner and to the extent provided by the provisions of this Act or the rules or

      orders made thereunder. In a case where any such provision imposes any

      requirement by way of licence, permit or authorisation, the narcotic drugs and

      psychotropic substances must also be dealt in accordance with the terms and

      conditions of such licence, permit or authorisation. The term “psychotropic

      substance” mentioned in
Section 8
must be seen in light of
Section 2(xxiii)
which refers to the
Schedule to the Act
and all the psychotropic substances

      mentioned therein. Additionally, to bring a case within the exception carved

      out under
Section 8
, each of the conditions specified therein must be satisfied.

      In other words, for the accused to take the plea that his dealing in the narcotic

      drug or psychotropic substance does not constitute an offence under
Section 8
,

      it must be proved that the drug or substance was being dealt with (a) for medical

      or scientific purposes AND; (b) in the manner and to the extent provided by the

      provisions of the
NDPS Act
or the NDPS Rules or the orders made thereunder

      AND; (c) in accordance with the terms and conditions of the licence, permit or

      authorisation, if any.
56. Therefore, if any psychotropic substance mentioned in the
Schedule to the Act
is being dealt with for a purpose other than medical or scientific purposes, an
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                     Page 43 of 189
offence under
Section 8(c)
of the NDPS Act would be made out. Furthermore,

     if any psychotropic substance mentioned in the
Schedule to the Act
is being

     dealt with for a medical or scientific purpose, but not in accordance with other

     provisions of the Act, rules, orders or, the terms and conditions of the licence,

     permit or authorisations, if any, then also, an offence under
Section 8(c)
of the

     NDPS Act could be said to have been made out. It is only when the exception

     is complied with entirely or wholly, that an accused can lay claim to the benefit

     provided under the said provision.
57.
Section 9
of the NDPS Act empowers the Central Government to permit and

     regulate certain activities subject to the provisions of
Section 8
. The same reads

     thus:
58.
Section 76
of the NDPS Act also empowers the Central Government to make

      rules for carrying out the purposes of the
NDPS Act
and reads thus:
59.   The NDPS Rules, 1985, have been brought into being by the Central

      Government in exercise of its powers under
Sections 9
and
76
of the NDPS

      Act, respectively
referred to above
. However, what must necessarily be kept in

      mind is that the power conferred upon the Central Government under
Sections

      9
and
76
of the NDPS Act, respectively, is subject to
Section 8
and this is

      evident by the use of the phrase “subject to the provisions of
Section 8
” and

      “subject to the other provisions of the Act” in both the provisions. Therefore,

      the NDPS rules must not be understood as laying down standards different from

      or inconsistent with the substantive provisions of the
NDPS Act
, especially
Section 8
and the
Schedule to the NDPS Act
. The underlying object of the

      NDPS rules is to “permit and regulate” certain activities for carrying out the

      purposes of the
NDPS Act
and not to “prohibit” those activities.
60. Rule 2(k) of the NDPS Rules, 1985, states that – “words and expressions used

      herein and not defined, but defined in the Act shall have the meanings

      respectively assigned to them in the Act.”. Therefore, any reference to

      “psychotropic substances” under the NDPS Rules must relate to the definition

      provided under
Section 2(xxiii)
of the NDPS Act, which consists of the entire

      list of psychotropic substances enumerated under the
Schedule to the Act
.

      Chapter VI of the NDPS rules relate to the import, export and transhipment of

      narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances and Chapter VII deals with the
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                    Page 46 of 189
manufacture, sale, purchase, consumption, use, possession and transport of

      psychotropic substances. Chapter VIIA details certain special provisions

      regarding the manufacture, possession, transport, import-export, purchase and

      consumption of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances for medical,

      scientific and training purposes. It would be apposite to mention at this stage

      that the NDPS rules have undergone some significant changes over the years.

      However, our inquiry would be limited to the version of the NDPS Rules as it

      existed during the time the offence is alleged to have been committed in the

      present case i.e., as on 27.09.2003.
61.   Chapters VI and VII respectively, contain Rules 53 to 63 and 64 to 67

      respectively. Under Chapter VI, Rule 53 provides for a general prohibition and

      states that subject to the other provisions of this Chapter, the import into and

      export out of India of the narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances specified

      in “Schedule I appended to the Rules” is prohibited. However, an exception to

      this general rule was carved out under its first proviso by stating that nothing

      in this rule shall apply in case “the drug substance” is imported into or exported

      out of India subject to an import certificate or export authorisation issued under

      the provision of this Chapter and for the purpose mentioned under Chapter

      VIIA. The expression “the drug substance” mentioned in the proviso must

      naturally be read to mean a “Schedule I substance” since the language of Rule
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                       Page 47 of 189
53 is phrased such that it alludes to a Schedule I substance only. Therefore, in

      short, the import and export of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances

      specifically mentioned under Schedule I of the Rules is generally disallowed

      provided that person may import and export them, with a valid import

      certificate or export authorisation, for the limited purposes mentioned under

      Chapter VIIA.
62.   Rule 55 on the ‘Application for an Import Certificate’ provides that, subject to

      Rule 53 as enumerated above, no narcotic drug or psychotropic substance

      specified in the “
Schedule of the Act
” shall be imported into India without an

      import certificate, in respect of the consignment, issued by the issuing

      authority, as per the form appended to the Rules. Rule 57 on ‘Transit’ states

      that subject to the provisions of
Section 79
of the NDPS Act and Rule 53, no

      consignment of any narcotic drug or psychotropic substance specified in the

      “
Schedule of the Act
” shall be allowed to be transited through India unless such

      consignment is accompanied by a valid export authorisation in this behalf

      issued by the Government of the exporting country. Rule 58 relating to the

      ‘Application for Export Authorisation’ provides that, subject to Rules 53 and

      53A, no narcotic drugs or psychotropic substances specified in the “
Schedule

      of the Act
” shall be exported out of India without an export authorisation in

      respect of the consignment, issued by the issuing authority in the requisite form
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                      Page 48 of 189
appended to the Rules. Rule 60 relating to ‘Transhipment’ provides that, subject

      to the provisions of
Section 79
of the NDPS Act and Rule 53, no consignment

      of narcotic drug or psychotropic substance specified in the “
Schedule to the

      Act
” shall be allowed to be transhipped at any port in India save with the

      permission of the Collector of Customs. Rule 61 on the ‘Procedure for

      Transhipment’ states that while allowing any consignment of narcotic drug or

      psychotropic substance specified in the “
Schedule to the Act
” to be transhipped,

      the Collector of Customs shall inter alia satisfy himself that the consignment

      is accompanied by a valid export authorisation issued by the exporting country.
63.   What is discernible from the aforementioned rules under Chapter VI is that the

      import into and export out of India of all psychotropic substances (as listed in

      the
Schedule to the Act
) must be accompanied by a valid import certificate and

      export authorisation issued by the issuing authority in India. As regards the

      transit and transhipment of any psychotropic substance (as listed in the
Schedule to the Act
) in India, a valid export authorisation issued by the

      exporting country is a requisite. On the other hand, what Rule 53 seeks to

      achieve is to restrict the import and export of substances enumerated in

      Schedule I of the Rules to a pre-determined set of purposes as explained under

      Chapter VIIA, despite having obtained an import certificate or export

      authorisation under the other rules of this Chapter. This provision i.e., Rule 53
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                      Page 49 of 189
relating to the Schedule I substances must not be flouted and this is especially

      evident through the phrase “subject to Rule 53” featuring in almost every rule

      under this Chapter. It is therefore, clear that, as far as import or export is

      concerned, the substances mentioned in Schedule I appended to the Rules are

      more strictly regulated or restricted in comparison to the larger list of

      psychotropic substances mentioned in the
Schedule to the Act
. However, this

      is not to say that the psychotropic substances mentioned only in the
Schedule

      to the Act
are unregulated. Furthermore, it also cannot be said that the

      substances mentioned in Schedule I of the NDPS Rules are absolutely

      prohibited from being imported or exported as per
Section 8
of the NDPS Act

      since they are clearly allowed to be validly imported and exported for the

      limited purposes enumerated under Chapter VIIA.
65. What can be discerned from the Rules 64 and 65 respectively, elaborated

     hereinabove is that: First, the manufacture of all psychotropic substances (as

     listed in the
Schedule to the Act
) must be in accordance with the conditions

     prescribed in the licence granted under the D&C Rules and the permissible

     quantity to be manufactured would be intimated to the licensee at the time the

     licence is issued. Notwithstanding the prohibition to deal in psychotropic

     substances contained in
Section 8(c)
of the NDPS Act, the manufacture thereof

     is permitted subject to compliance with the D&C Act and its Rules. Secondly,

     there is a general rule absolutely prohibiting the manufacture, possession,

     transport, import inter-State, export inter-State, sale, purchase, consumption or

     use of any of the psychotropic substances which find mention in Schedule I

     appended to the Rules. However, the above activities can be done vis-á-vis the
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                     Page 52 of 189
substances mentioned in Schedule I appended to the Rules if their manufacture,

     possession, transport, import inter-State, export inter-State, sale, purchase,

     consumption or use is in accordance with other provisions of the Chapter which

     generally apply to all psychotropic substances (as listed in the
Schedule to the

     Act
) and for the limited purposes mentioned under Chapter VIIA. In other

     words, Schedule I substances can also be dealt in, in due compliance with the

     rules applicable generally to all the psychotropic substances but specifically

     only for the purposes mentioned under Chapter VIIA. However, while issuing

     a licence of manufacture with respect to the Schedule I substances, the

     Licensing Authority shall consult the Narcotics Commissioner. Therefore,

     Rules 64 and 65 respectively, permit the manufacture of psychotropic

     substances mentioned under Schedule I of the Rules however subject to certain

     provisions and purposes. This can be culled out from a holistic reading of Rules

     64 and 65 respectively, and the two provisos which follow Rule 65(3). Thirdly,

     the manufacture of all psychotropic substances (as listed in the
Schedule to the

     Act
), and those mentioned under Schedule I of the Rules specifically for the

     purposes elaborated under Chapter VIIA, in violation of the conditions of

     licence of manufacture issued under the D&C Act would amount to a

     contravention of Rule 65 of the NDPS Rules and thereby
Section 8
of the NDPS

     Act itself. Therefore, when such a contravention of the conditions of licence

     occurs, it cannot be said that an offence under the
NDPS Act
would not be made
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                    Page 53 of 189
out and that the contravention would be solely covered by the D&C regime.
Due to the operation of Rule 65, violation of any of the conditions of licence

      under the D&C Act read with its Rules would ipso facto tantamount to a

      violation of the
NDPS Act
read with its Rules as well.
66.   Rule 66 on ‘Possession etc. of psychotropic substances’ states that no person

      shall possess any psychotropic substance (as listed in the
Schedule to the Act
)

      for any of the purposes covered by the D&C Rules, unless he is lawfully

      authorised to possess such substance for any of the said purposes under these

      rules. Therefore, what is being conveyed herein is that as far as substances

      mentioned under Schedule I are concerned, they can be possessed only for the

      purposes mentioned under Chapter VIIA, and as far as the other substances not

      being Schedule I substances but which are listed in the
Schedule to the Act
are

      concerned, they can be possessed for the purposes mentioned under Chapter

      VIIA and also for other purposes which necessarily fall under the broader

      considerations of medical or scientific purposes as mentioned under
Section 8
of the NDPS Act. This compliance is in addition to the accused persons

      possessing the said substances in accordance with the purposes elaborated

      under the D&C Rules and the requirements thereunder. Sub-rule (2), however,

      allows any research institution or a hospital or a dispensary maintained or

      supported by the Government or local body or by charity or voluntary
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                    Page 54 of 189
subscription, which is not normally authorised to possess the psychotropic

     substances under the D&C Rules, or any person who is not so authorised under

     the D&C Rules, to possess a reasonable quantity of such substance as may be

     necessary for their genuine scientific or medical requirements or both, for such

     period as is deemed necessary by the said research institution or hospital or

     dispensary or person, as the case may be. In case, of an individual person,

     possessing the substance for his personal medical use, the quantity shall not

     exceed one 100 dosage units at a time. The research institution, hospital and

     dispensary referred to herein shall maintain proper accounts and records in

     relation to the purchase and consumption of the psychotropic substance in their

     possession.
67. Rule 67 on ‘Transport of psychotropic substance’ provides that, subject to the

     provisions of Rule 64, no consignment of psychotropic substance shall be

     transported, imported inter-State or exported inter-State unless such a

     consignment is accompanied by a consignment note appended to the Rules and

     in the manner provided under the Rules. The consignor and consignee must

     keep the consignment note for a period of two years and the said note may be

     inspected at any time by an officer authorised in this behalf by the Central

     Government. This Rule would again apply to all psychotropic substances (as

     mentioned under the
Schedule to the Act
).
68. At this stage, it may be observed that it was vide a notification dated 25th June,

     1997 that Chapter VIIA containing Rule 67A came to be inserted in the NDPS

     Rules. Chapter VIIA states that, notwithstanding anything contained in the

     foregoing provisions of these Rules, a narcotic drug or psychotropic substance

     may be used for - (i) scientific requirements including analytical requirements

     of any Government laboratory or any research institution in India or abroad; or
(ii) very limited medical requirements of a foreigner by a duly authorised

     person of a hospital or any other establishment of the Government especially

     approved by that foreign Government; or (iii) the purpose of de-addiction of

     drug addicts by the Government or local body or by an approved charity or

     voluntary organisation or by such other institution as may be approved by the

     Central Government. The persons performing medical or scientific functions as

     mentioned hereinabove shall maintain records concerning the acquisition of the

     substance and the details of their use in Form 7 of these rules and such records

     are to be preserved for at least two years. Furthermore, a narcotic drug or

     psychotropic substance may be supplied or dispensed for use to a foreigner

     pursuant to a medical prescription only from authorised licensed pharmacists

     or other authorised retail distributors designated by authorities responsible for

     public health.
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                     Page 56 of 189
69. Upon a meticulous analysis of the NDPS rules relating to psychotropic

     substances and analysing the purposes for which they are to be dealt in, along

     with the requirements and procedures to be complied with for each kind of

     dealing in the psychotropic substances, an underlying idea resonates throughout

     these rules i.e., that any dealing in the psychotropic substances mentioned under

     Schedule I of the Rules must strictly be in accordance with the NDPS Rules

     AND ONLY for the purposes enumerated under Chapter VIIA of the NDPS

     Rules. The substances not finding a mention under Schedule I of the Rules but

     listed in the
Schedule to the Act
must also meet with the requirements cast upon

     by the NDPS Rules. The difference as regards these substances however is that

     while they may be dealt with for the purposes enumerated under Chapter VIIA

     of the NDPS Rules, they can also be dealt with for other purposes, provided

     that those purposes strictly fall under the larger umbrella of “medical or

     scientific purposes” as provided for in
Section 8
of the NDPS Act. Whether the

     accused has dealt with it within the confines of the expression “medical or

     scientific purposes” must obviously be determined on the facts and

     circumstances of each case. It can therefore be said that the substances under

     Schedule I to the Rules are more strictly restricted compared to the remaining

     psychotropic substances under the
Schedule to the Act
which are restricted

     more moderately in comparison. On this aspect, our scheme is more or less

     similar to the scheme of the Convention on Psychotropic substances, 1971. The
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                     Page 57 of 189
different levels in restriction could be seen as the primary reason behind

      providing two different schedules, i.e., one under the Act and another under the

      Rules.
Moreover, the Schedule to the Act
can be considered as a superset of all

      psychotropic substances wherein those substances mentioned under Schedule I

      of the Rules form a small, more restricted subset of the larger superset.



c.     Analysing the treatment of substances mentioned in the
Schedule to
       the Act
and not in Schedule I of the Rules by previous decisions of this
       Court.

71.   Therefore, the dictum as laid in
Hussain
(supra) is that “Buprenorphine

      tidigesic” is a psychotropic substance to which the rigours of
Section 8
of the

      NDPS Act and Rule 66 of the NDPS Rules would apply, however, as the
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                      Page 61 of 189
accused was found to be in possession of less than 100 dosage units of the

     substance, with a valid medical prescription, for his personal medical use, he

     was held to have not committed an offence under
Section 8
of the NDPS Act

     as there was no violation of Rule 66.

77.   Again in
D. Ramakrishnan v. Intelligence Officer, Narcotic Control Bureau
reported in (2009) 14 SCC 603, the appellant and a co-accused were engaged

      in the internet pharmacy business and were alleged to have exported drugs

      abroad including “Alprazolam”, “Lorazepam” and “Nitrazepam” which find

      place at S. Nos. 30, 56 and 64 of the
Schedule to the NDPS Act
respectively.

      Since the activities were carried on without a valid export authorisation as

      required under the NDPS regime, the appellant and his co-accused were

      prosecuted under
Section 8(c)
read with
Sections 22
,
23
,
25
,
27-A
,
53
,
53-A
and
58
of the NDPS Act.
Taking recourse to Rajesh Kumar Gupta (supra), it

      was argued that the drugs being Schedule G and H drugs under the D&C Rules

      and not mentioned in Schedule I to the NDPS Rules, its export thereof would

      not attract the provisions of Rule 58 of the NDPS Rules which requires an

      export authorisation. This is because Rules 53 and 64 respectively being the

      genus and dealing with substances under Schedule I of the NDPS Rules would
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                      Page 72 of 189
mean that Rule 58 is also applicable only to such Schedule I substances.
i.    First, this Court in its decision analysed the true scope and ambit of
Section 8(c)
of the NDPS Act and stated that
Section 8(c)
in no

           uncertain terms prohibits the dealing in any manner in any narcotic

           drug or psychotropic substance. However, an exception to such

           prohibition is also contained in the said section and that is, that the

           dealing in any narcotic drug or psychotropic substance would be

           permitted “in the manner and to the extent provided by the provisions

           of this Act or the Rules or Orders made thereunder”. Therefore, it was

           declared that a twin condition must be fulfilled i.e., the dealing must
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                    Page 74 of 189
be for medical or scientific purposes AND in the manner and to the

           extent provided by the provisions of the Act, Rules, or Orders made

           thereunder and the Court stated as thus:
Therefore, it cannot be said that the prohibition contained under
Section 8
would not be attracted in respect of all those psychotropic

           substances which find a mention only in the
Schedule to the Act
but

           not in Schedule I to the Rules framed under the Act. The relevant

           observations are as thus:
Unfortunately, the learned Judges in reaching such a
              conclusion ignored the mandate of
Section 8(c)
which inter alia
              prohibits in absolute terms import into and export out of India
              of any narcotic drug and psychotropic substance. Rules framed
              under the Act cannot be understood to create rights and
              obligations contrary to those contained in the parent Act.
30. On examination of the scheme of Rules 53 to 63 which
              appear in Chapter VI, we are of the opinion that Rule 53 [
              “53.General prohibition.—Subject to the other provisions of
              this Chapter, the import into and export out of India of the
              narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances specified in
              Schedule I is prohibited: Provided that nothing in this rule shall
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                      Page 78 of 189
apply in case the drug substance is imported into or exported
              out of India subject to an import certificate or export
              authorisation issued under the provision of this Chapter and for
              the purposes mentioned in Chapter VII-A.”] reiterates an
              aspect of the larger prohibition contained in
Section 8(c)
i.e. the
              prohibition of import into and export out of India of the narcotic
              drugs and psychotropic substances specified in Schedule I to the
              Rules. The proviso thereto however enables the import into and
              export out of India on the basis of an import certificate or export
              authorisation issued under the provisions of Chapter VI. The
              subsequent rules stipulate the conditions subject to which and
              the procedure to be followed by which some of the narcotic
              drugs and psychotropic substances could be imported into India
              or exported out of India. For example, opium is a narcotic drug
              by definition under
Section 2(xiv)
of the Act whose export and
              import is prohibited under
Section 8(c)
. But Rule 54 [
              “54.Import of opium, etc.—The import of—(i) opium,
              concentrate of poppy straw, and(ii) morphine, codeine,
              thebaine, and their salts is prohibited save by the Government
              Opium Factory; Provided that nothing in this rule shall apply
              to import of morphine, codeine, thebaine and their salts by
              manufacturers notified by the Government, for use in
              manufacture of products to be exported or to imports of small
              quantities of morphine, codeine and thebaine and their salts not
              exceeding a total of 1 kilogram during a calendar year for
              analytical purposes by an importer, after following the
              procedure under Rule 55 and subject to such conditions as may
              be specified in the import certificate issued in Form 4-
              A.”(emphasis supplied)] authorises the import of opium by the
              Government opium factory. The construction such as the one
              placed on Rule 53 in Rajesh Kumar Gupta case [
State of
              Uttaranchal v. Rajesh Kumar Gupta
, (2007) 1 SCC 355 :
31. Chapter VII deals with psychotropic substances. No doubt
              Rule 64 [ “64.General prohibition.—No person shall
              manufacture, possess, transport, import inter-State, export
              inter-State, sell, purchase, consume or use any of the
              psychotropic substances specified in Schedule I.”] once again
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                      Page 79 of 189
purports to prohibit various operations other than import into
              or export out of India in psychotropic substances specified in
              Schedule I for the obvious reason that import and export
              operations are already covered by Rule 53. Rule 65 authorises
              the manufacture of psychotropic substances other than those
              specified in Schedule I to the Rules subject to and in accordance
              with the conditions of a licence granted under the 1945 Rules.
              The rule also provides for various other incidental matters. Rule
              65-A prohibits the sale, purchase, consumption or use of any
              psychotropic substances except in accordance with the 1945
              Rules.
32. Rule 66 prohibits any person from having in possession any
              psychotropic substance even for any of the purposes authorised
              under the 1945 Rules unless the person in possession of such a
              psychotropic substance is lawfully authorised to possess such
              substance for any of the purposes mentioned under the 1985
              Rules. Persons who are authorised under the 1985 Rules, and
              the quantities of the material such persons are authorised to
              possess, are specified under Rule 66(2). They are:
33. Rule 66 reads as follows:
34. On the above analysis of the provisions of Chapters VI and
              VII of the 1985 Rules, we are of the opinion, both these chapters
              contain rules permitting and regulating the import and export
              of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances other than those
              specified in Schedule I to the 1985 Rules subject to various
              conditions and procedure stipulated in Chapter VI. Whereas
              Chapter VII deals exclusively with various other aspects
              of dealing in psychotropic substances and the conditions
              subject to which such dealing in is permitted. We are of the
              opinion that both Rules 53 and 64 are really in the nature of
              exception to the general scheme of Chapters VI and VII
              respectively containing a list of narcotic drugs and
              psychotropic substances which cannot be dealt in any manner
              notwithstanding the other provisions of these two chapters. We
              are of the clear opinion that neither Rule 53 nor Rule 64 is a
              source of authority for prohibiting the dealing in narcotic drugs
              and psychotropic substances, the source is
Section 8
. Rajesh
              Kumar Gupta case [
State of Uttaranchal v. Rajesh Kumar
              Gupta
, (2007) 1 SCC 355 : (2007) 1 SCC (Cri) 356] in our view
              is wrongly decided.”
                                                    (Emphasis supplied)
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                    Page 81 of 189
Therefore, it was declared that it is only the psychotropic substances

           appended to Schedule I of the Rules which are regulated by the NDPS

           Rules, and dealing in substances, not finding a mention in Schedule I,

           would be unregulated and thus, not amount to an offence under
Section 8(c)
.
ii.   Sanjeev V. Deshpande (supra) while overruling Rajesh Kumar

           Gupta (supra) dispelled the idea that Rules 53 and 64 respectively,

           constituted a genus but instead stated that Rules 53 and 64

           respectively, are in the nature of an exception to the general scheme

           of their respective Chapters. To put it more clearly, that Rules 53 and

           64 respectively stated that substances under Schedule I of the Rules

           cannot be dealt with in any manner whatsoever and the other Rules in

           the Chapter proceeded to lay down the procedure and conditions

           under which substances other than those mentioned in Schedule I of

           the Rules but contained in the
Schedule to the Act
, could be dealt with.

           Therefore, if an accused is charged with an offence for dealing with a

           substance mentioned under the
Schedule to the Act
and not in

           Schedule I of the Rules, he would be guilty of an offence under
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                     Page 83 of 189
Section 8(c)
if the conditions and procedure laid down under the

            Rules, other than Rules 53 and 64, are not complied with.
81.   However, a detailed and comprehensive analysis of Chapters VI and VII of the

      NDPS Rules, inter alia, makes it clear that the substances mentioned under

      Schedule I of the Rules are not absolutely prohibited to be dealt in, as stated in

      Sanjeev V. Deshpande (supra). They are indeed allowed to be dealt with for

      the limited purposes as detailed in Chapter VIIA of the NDPS Rules. It goes

      without saying that in such dealing for the purposes mentioned under Chapter

      VIIA, persons would have to comply with the set of procedures and conditions

      to which the other substances are subjected to and strict compliance of all those

      rules are mandatory considering the high degree of havoc and menace that the

      substances mentioned in Schedule I to the NDPS Rules can create on public

      health and societal well-being.
82.   The NDPS rules were revamped in the year 2015 vide G.S.R. 224(E) dated

      25.03.2015 with a view to remove the ambiguity that the phrasing of several

      rules created. That the psychotropic substances mentioned under Schedule I of

      the NDPS Rules can also be dealt with but for the restricted and limited

      purposes enumerated under Chapter VIIA of the Rules and in compliance with

      the requirements under the other rules, is evident from the language of the rules
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                       Page 84 of 189
which came into effect post 25.03.2015. To illustrate, Rule 53 of the NDPS

      Rules now reads as thus:
d.     The provisions of the
NDPS Act
and its Rules are “in addition to” the
       D&C Act and the Rules made thereunder.
86.
Section 80
of the NDPS Act states that the application of the D&C Act would

      not be barred and reads as follows:
87.   In P. Ramanatha Aiyar’s Advanced Law Lexicon, the word derogation is

      defined as “the partial repeal or abrogation of a law by a later act that limits

      its scope or impairs its utility and force”. It is also stated that the word

      “derogate” is a term of legislation. “Derogation” is partial and indirect

      abrogation i.e., when a subsequent law reduces the force and application of an

      older law, the character of the subsequent law is technically said to be

      derogatory. Therefore, the express language employed herein which states that

      the
NDPS Act
is not in derogation of the D&C Act leads to the inference that

      the enactment of the
NDPS Act
must not in any way be understood to take away

      the scope of an offence being also made out under the D&C Act. Furthermore,

      it is also stated that the provisions of the
NDPS Act
and its Rules “shall be in

      addition to” the D&C Act or the Rules made thereunder. Therefore, in the

      reverse scenario, i.e., when an offence under the D&C Act is made out or can

      potentially be made out, the accused can also be charged or prosecuted for an
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                     Page 87 of 189
offence under the
NDPS Act
. Any argument to the contrary would be

      untenable. This is so because the
NDPS Act
applies in addition to the provisions

      of the D&C Act. Inevitably, there may arise situations wherein the substance

      in question in a particular case falls under the ambit of both the
NDPS Act
and

      D&C Act. However, the overlap would not necessarily imply that the

      application of the provisions of the
NDPS Act
would be at the cost of exclusion

      of the provisions of D&C Act, or vice versa.
Section 80
of the NDPS Act must

      be understood in the context and object behind the coming into force of these

      two legislations i.e., the
NDPS Act
and D&C Act respectively, and the distinct

      purposes that they seek to achieve.
90. On a conspectus of the foregoing discussion on the scheme of the
NDPS Act
and its rules along with the D&C Act and the rules made thereunder, the

     position of law can be succinctly stated as follows:
iii.   The NDPS Rules, 1985 have been brought into being by the Central

            Government in exercise of the powers under
Sections 9
and
76
of the
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                       Page 93 of 189
NDPS Act
, respectively. The underlying object of the NDPS rules is

           to “permit and regulate” certain activities for carrying out the

           purposes of the
NDPS Act
and not to “prohibit” those activities. The

           NDPS rules must not be understood as laying down standards

           different from or inconsistent with the substantive provisions of the
NDPS Act
, especially
Section 8
and the
Schedule to the NDPS Act
.

     iv.   Chapter VI of the NDPS Rules, inter alia, states that the import into

           and export out of India of all psychotropic substances, including those

           only mentioned under the
Schedule to the Act
, must be accompanied

           by a valid import certificate and export authorisation. However, the

           import and export of substances enumerated in Schedule I of the Rules

           is restricted to a pre-determined set of purposes as explained under

           Chapter VIIA, irrespective of having obtained an import certificate or

           export authorisation under the other rules of this Chapter.

     v.    Chapter VII indicates that the manufacture of all psychotropic

           substances, including those mentioned only under the
Schedule to the

           Act
must be in accordance with the conditions of licence issued under

           the D&C Rules. Despite there being a general rule absolutely

           prohibiting the manufacture, possession, transport, import inter-State,

           export inter-State, sale, purchase, consumption or use of any of the

           psychotropic substances which find mention in Schedule I appended
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                    Page 94 of 189
to the Rules, still the above activities can be done vis-á-vis the

            substances mentioned in Schedule I appended to the Rules, provided

            such activities are in accordance with other provisions of the Chapter

            which generally apply to all psychotropic substances, and for the

            limited purposes mentioned under Chapter VIIA.
vi.    The manufacture of all psychotropic substances mentioned under the
Schedule to the Act
, and those mentioned under Schedule I of the

            Rules (provided they are manufactured only for the purposes

            elaborated under Chapter VIIA), in violation of the conditions of

            licence of manufacture issued under the D&C Act and its rules would

            amount to a contravention of Rule 65 of the NDPS Rules and thereby
Section 8
of the NDPS Act itself. In other words, due to the operation

            of Rule 65, a violation of the condition of licence under the D&C Act

            read with its Rules would ipso facto tantamount to a violation of the
NDPS Act
read with its Rules.
vii.   Furthermore, no person shall possess any psychotropic substance,

            including those mentioned only under the
Schedule to the Act
for any

            of the purposes covered by the D&C Rules, unless he is lawfully

            authorised to possess such substance for any of the said purposes

            under the NDPS rules. Therefore, Schedule I substances can be

            possessed only for the purposes mentioned under Chapter VIIA. All
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                    Page 95 of 189
other substances mentioned only under the
Schedule to the Act
can be

             possessed for the purposes mentioned under Chapter VIIA and also

             for the purposes falling under the broad umbrella of “medical or

             scientific purposes” as mentioned under
Section 8
of the NDPS Act.

             The above is in addition to the fulfilment of the requirements under

             the D&C Rules.
viii.   The underlying idea that resonates throughout the NDPS rules is that

             dealing in any of the psychotropic substances mentioned under

             Schedule I of the NDPS Rules must strictly be in accordance with the

             NDPS Rules AND ONLY for the purposes enumerated under Chapter

             VIIA of the NDPS Rules. The substances not figuring under Schedule

             I of the Rules but listed in the
Schedule to the Act
must also abide by

             the requirements cast upon by the NDPS Rules. The difference as

             regards these substances, however, is that while they may be dealt

             with for the purposes enumerated under Chapter VIIA of the NDPS

             Rules, they can also be dealt with for other “medical and scientific

             purposes”. Whether the accused has dealt with it within the confines

             of the expression “medical or scientific purposes” would be

             determined on the facts and circumstances of each case.
ix.     Therefore, the substances under Schedule I to the Rules are more

             strictly restricted and the remaining psychotropic substances under
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                       Page 96 of 189
the
Schedule to the Act
are more leniently restricted. The different

            levels in restriction could be seen as the primary reason behind

            providing two different schedules, i.e., one under the Act and another

            under the Rules.
xi.    To say that no offence would be made out in a case where an accused

            deals with a substance mentioned only under the
Schedule to the Act
,

            would have the consequence of rendering the entire
Schedule to the

            Act
useless, unnecessary and nugatory.
xii.   Rajesh Kumar Gupta (supra) assumed that the prohibitory power

            could only be traced to Rules 53 and 64 of the NDPS Rules

            respectively, and stated that Rules 53 and 64 of the NDPS Rules

            respectively, were a genus and the other rules following in their
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                    Page 97 of 189
respective Chapters were species thereof. Therefore, since Rules 53

             and 64 respectively, only related to the substances listed under

             Schedule I of the Rules, it was held that the dealing in of substances

             not finding a mention in Schedule I of the Rules and only listed under

             the
Schedule to the Act
, would be unregulated by the Rules and thus,

             would not amount to an offence under
Section 8(c)
.
xiii.   On the other hand, Sanjeev V. Deshpande (supra) overruled Rajesh

             Kumar Gupta (supra) by explaining that it is
Section 8(c)
of the

             NDPS Act which prohibits various activities with respect to

             psychotropic substances and the source of this prohibitory power

             cannot be attributed to Rules 53 and 64 respectively. Rules 53 and 64

             are in the nature of an exception to the general scheme of the NDPS

             Rules. While Rules 53 and 64 state that the substances under Schedule

             I of the Rules cannot be dealt with in any manner, the other substances

             i.e., those mentioned under the
Schedule to the Act
, are also regulated

             under the other rules in the respective Chapters of the NDPS Rules.

     xiv.    However, what we understand as also being the essence of the scheme

             of the NDPS Rules is that, it does not absolutely prohibit the dealing

             in of the substances mentioned under Schedule I of the Rules as held

             in Sanjeev V. Deshpande (supra). These substances figuring in

             Schedule I of the Rules can also be dealt with but only for the limited
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                      Page 98 of 189
purposes mentioned under Chapter VIIA of the NDPS Rules. This is

           evident from the re-phrasing of the NDPS Rules which was effected

           on 25.03.2015, which according to us, has not changed the meaning

           of the Rules but only altered its language.
xv.
Section 80
states that the provisions of the
NDPS Act
or the Rules

           made thereunder shall be in addition to, and not in derogation of the

           D&C Act and the Rules made thereunder. Therefore, when an offence

           under the D&C Act is made out or can potentially be made out, the

           accused can also be charged or prosecuted for an offence under the
NDPS Act
or vice-versa. The object sought to be achieved under both

           the legislations is also distinct i.e. the
NDPS Act
is a special law

           enacted to regulate the operations relating to narcotic drugs and

           psychotropic substances with a view to curb and penalise the usage of

           drugs by persons for intoxication etc., whereas the D&C Act was

           enacted to prevent substandard, adulterated and spurious drugs from

           entering the medical market and to maintain high standards in medical

           treatment. Hence, offences under both the enactments can also be said

           to have been constituted simultaneously, where the circumstances so

           require.
91.   The declaration of a statute dealing with substantive rights, by the legislature,

      is considered to be prospective unless it is expressly or by necessary implication

      made to have retrospective operation. The legal maxim “Nova Constitutio

      Futuris Forman Imponere Debet, Non Praeteritis” indicating that a new law

      ought to regulate what is to follow and not the past, carries with it a presumption

      of prospectivity and this presumption is generally said to operate unless the

      contrary is shown by an express provision in the statute or if the retrospectivity

      is otherwise discernible through necessary implication. This is because such

      statutes would have the consequence of affecting vested rights, impose new

      burdens or impair existing obligations. However, when a decision rendering an

      opinion as regards the interpretation of a penal provision is subsequently

      overruled by the decision of a larger bench, the consequence of the overruling

      is starkly different and by default, retrospective. This is because it is settled law

      that the law declared by this Court is retrospective and is normally assumed to

      be the law from the inception.
Prospective operation is only exception to this normal rule. [...]”

                                                      (Emphasis supplied)
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                      Page 107 of 189
125. Salmond, in his acclaimed work on jurisprudence, is of the opinion that a judge

     does not make law and merely declares it. According to him, when a particular

     decision is overruled, it is declared that the supposed rule laid down in such an

     overruled decision was never the right law. Since, it’s authoritative value is

     erased completely, any intermediate transaction, despite being made on the

     strength of that supposed rule, would be governed by the principles established

     in the overruling decision.
128. It is obvious that, in the factual circumstances before us, especially in matters

     of a criminal nature, the essence of the decision laid down in Rajesh Kumar

     Gupta (supra) could not be considered to have been separately embraced in
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                     Page 153 of 189
any contract, both express or implied. On the contrary, it is the legislative

     authority of the
NDPS Act
, more particularly
Section 8
of the NDPS Act, which

     would have the final say on whether an offence is made out or not or govern

     the facts which the accused persons have subjected themselves to. When the

     very legal interpretation given to
Section 8
of the NDPS Act could be said to

     have been wrong and misplaced in the overruled decision, it naturally follows

     that no vested right, whatsoever, could have accrued or be said to have existed

     independently of the statute, to such persons accused of a committing an

     offence under
Section 8
. More so, when the decision in Rajesh Kumar Gupta

     (supra) was an outlier on the issue when compared to several decisions that

     came prior to it.
and any such investigation, legal proceeding or
                  remedy may be instituted, continued or enforced, and
                  any such penalty, forfeiture or punishment may be
                  imposed as if the repealing Act or Regulation had not
                  been passed.”

              A plain reading of the above provision indicates that the repeal
              of an enactment shall not affect previous operation, unless a
              different intention appears. It may be appropriately noted here
              that the present case does not involve repeal or revival of any
              enactment but is a case where a Constitution Bench of this
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                    Page 162 of 189
Court has declared a statutory provision as invalid and
              unconstitutional being hit by
Article 14
of the Constitution. As
              such
Section 6
of the 1897 Act will have no application.”

                                                    (Emphasis supplied)
135. Moreover, consider a situation wherein a certain statute or provision is declared

     to be unconstitutional by this Court for being violative of
Article 14
of the

     Constitution but with prospective effect. Can it be argued that the actions

     undertaken on the basis of that unconstitutional provision or legislation, until

     the date of the judgment, would be open to being challenged for also being
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                     Page 165 of 189
violative of
Article 14?
This would necessarily be answered in the negative

     because the Court consciously declares prospectivity after weighing and

     balancing all interests and practical realities. No individual can claim the

     benefit of the decision declaring a provision as unconstitutional for transactions

     or events which occurred prior to that decision if the intention to give

     prospective effect to the decision is plain and direct. No doubt, the actions

     wrongly taken in the past would not be automatically validated but on a balance

     of equities, a challenge to those actions are also disallowed. Similarly, while a

     decision is being overruled and the default rule of retrospectivity in matters of

     overruling is applied, it would not be permissible for anyone to contend that

     any right accrued to them on the basis of the judgement which declared the

     wrong proposition of law. Therefore, the retrospective overruling of the

     decision in Rajesh Kumar Gupta (supra) cannot be faulted with for being

     possibly hit by
Article 20(1)
of the Constitution. It would not be open for an

     accused to contend that any right accrued to them on the basis of the judgement

     in Rajesh Kumar Gupta (supra). However, with a view to do complete justice

     to the issue at hand, we declare that matters in which the trial has already

     concluded on the basis of the incorrect exposition of law and have attained

     finality, would not be disturbed. It would be tedious endeavour for all those

     acquittals to be re-opened and re-tried again.
Having said so, any and all
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                     Page 166 of 189
pending matters would be adjudged on the basis of the correct interpretation of

     law as declared in
Sanjeev V Deshpande
(supra).
it was reiterated that it was only the conviction or sentence for any offence

     under an ex-post facto law that is prohibited under
Article 20(1).
The overruling

     of a decision cannot be equated to the enactment of an ex-post facto law,

     especially when the interpretation given to the statute/provision in the

     overruling decision is not a novel and unreasonably expansive interpretation of

     the provision in question such that it was completely unforseeable. An ex-post

     facto law lays down a new or completely alternate legal position from what

     existed before. The same is not the effect of an overruling decision which only

     interprets the intention which always remained with the legislature while

     enacting the concerned provision. The indiscriminate dealing in of substances

     which are only mentioned under the
Schedule to the Act
cannot be said to have

     been indubitably legal and allowed by the legislation prior to the decision in
Sanjeev V Deshpande
(supra).
141. One another question of law which has sprung up in the facts of our case is

       whether, after the charges are framed by the Trial Court, an accused could be

       discharged or his charges could be deleted through an application made under
Section 216
of the CrPC.
143. Under this provision, any Court is empowered to “alter” or “add” to any charge

     framed against the accused, at any time before the judgment is pronounced.

     Therefore, an outer time limit is set i.e. the power conferred upon the Courts

     cannot be exercised after a decision is pronounced in the matter. Although the

     provision does not expressly provide for the stage of the trial after which the

     power under
Section 216
CrPC can be exercised, yet logic and rationale

     obviously requires it to be exercised after a charge has been framed by the Trial

     Court under
Section 228
CrPC. For if no charge has been framed, there arises

     no occasion to add or alter it. As a natural corollary, if an accused has already

     been discharged under
Section 227
CrPC, no application or action under
Section 216
CrPC would be maintainable.
150. However, if careful attention is paid to the orders of the Special Judge in both

     the appeals, it cannot be said that they have exercised their power under Section

     216 to “alter” the charge of the accused persons. We say so because, the charge

     which existed under
Sections 8
,
22
and
29
of the NDPS Act in Criminal Appeal

     No. 1319 of 2013 and under
Sections 8
and
22
of the NDPS Act in Criminal

     Appeal No. 272 of 2014 respectively were not varied and a different charge

     under a specific provision of the D&C Act was not made. In such a

     circumstance, in effect, the Special Judge had discharged or deleted the charge

     of the accused persons under the
NDPS Act
in both the appeals.
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                    Page 179 of 189
b.    Whether charges could be deleted or the accused be discharged under
Section 216
CrPC.
151.
Section 216
CrPC provides the Court with the power to do two things – One,

     alter a charge and two, add to a charge. Nowhere, does the provision expressly

     or by necessary implication lead to an inference that a charge could be deleted

     altogether. No doubt, the Court is given an expansive and wide-ranging power.

     However, that must not mean that the powers conferred are without any limits.
156. It cannot be said that the dealing in of “Buprenorphine Hydrochloride” would

     not amount to an offence under
Section 8
of the NDPS Act owing to the fact

     that the said psychotropic substance only finds mention under the
Schedule to

     the NDPS Act
and is not listed under Schedule I of the NDPS Rules. There

     exists nothing to indicate that Rules 53 and 64 of the NDPS Rules respectively,

     are the governing rules in their respective Chapters, more so, when the language
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                   Page 185 of 189
of the other rules in Chapters VI and VII respectively, are clear about their

     application to the substances mentioned under the
Schedule to the Act
as well.
157. All the psychotropic substances mentioned under the
Schedule to the Act
have

     potential grave and harmful consequences to the individual and the society at

     large, when abused. Some psychotropic substances mentioned under the
Schedule to the NDPS Act
are also mentioned under the D&C Act and the rules

     framed thereunder. This is only because those substances while capable of

     being abused for their inherent properties could also be used in the field of

     medicine. However, the mere mention of certain psychotropic substances under

     the D&C regime would not take them away from the purview of the
NDPS Act
,

     if they are also mentioned under the
Schedule to the NDPS Act
.
159. Furthermore, the retrospective application of the dictum in Sanjeev V.

     Deshpande (supra) would not give rise to any implications as regards the rights

     of the accused persons under
Article 20(1)
of the Constitution. This is because

     while overruling the decision in Rajesh Kumar Gupta (supra), the decision in

     Sanjeev V. Deshpande (supra) has only clarified the law as it stood from its

     inception and given true effect to the meaning assigned to the relevant

     provisions of the
NDPS Act
and the Rules thereunder, by the lawmakers. The

     same cannot be construed as creating a new offence. Additionally, the

     overruling of a decision cannot be equated to the enactment of an ex-post facto

     law, especially when the interpretation given to the statute/provision in the

     overruling decision is not a novel and unreasonably expansive interpretation of
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                    Page 187 of 189
the provision in question such that it was completely unforseeable. It cannot be

     reasonably argued that the indiscriminate dealing in of substances which are

     only mentioned under the
Schedule to the NDPS Act
and absent under Schedule

     I of the NDPS Rules, was indubitably legal and allowed by the legislation, prior

     to the decision in Sanjeev V. Deshpande (supra). Therefore, there remains no

     doubt in our minds that giving retrospective effect to the decision in Sanjeev

     V. Deshpande (supra) would be necessary considering the facts and

     circumstances in the background of which we are called upon to adjudicate

     these matters","The DRI(HQ) officers recovered 25 corrugated card board cartons which

     contained small packets, each having ten unlabelled glass ampoules with a

     water coloured liquid, along with several sheets of printed labels which read as

     “Buprenorphine Hydrochloride”. They also recovered one labelled glass

     ampoule containing the same coloured liquid from the table drawer of the

     respondent no. 1. Upon preparing a detailed inventory, it was stated that 1
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                     Page 4 of 189
labelled and 40,000 unlabelled glass ampoules containing Buprenorphine

     Hydrochloride which is a substance listed in the
Schedule to the NDPS Act
were recovered. Since the respondent no. 1 was unable to provide any

     permission or licence for the possession of the recovered glass ampoules, they

     were seized under the provisions of the
NDPS Act
. The samples were drawn

     and the test memo was prepared in the presence of the respondent no. 1 and the

     witnesses. On 27.09.2003, i.e., on the same day, the officers of CEC, Rohtak

     are said to have seized 23400 injections of Buprenorphine along with 100

     grams of Buprenorphine in its powder form, from M/s Win Drugs Ltd at Jind,

     Haryana as well.
5.   In response to the summons issued, the respondent no. 1 appeared and is said

     to have made a voluntary statement in writing dated 28.09.2003 which

     mentioned that during the course of his business as a customs clearing agent,

     he came in contact with one Mohd. Shebar Khan (hereinafter, “respondent no.

     2”) who handled the customs clearance of the drugs and medicines on behalf

     of Devang Bipin Parekh (hereinafter, “respondent no. 3”) of M/s Sarvodiya

     Enterprises, Mumbai. The statement further revealed the fact that the

     respondents were collectively involved in the illegal manufacture, storage,

     transport, sale and purchase of Buprenorphine Hydrochloride along with one

     Naresh Mittal of Win Drugs Ltd.
6.   On 28.09.2003, the respondent no. 1 was arrested for the alleged commission

     of the offence punishable under
Sections 22
and
29
of the NDPS Act

     respectively and was remanded to judicial custody. Since Naresh Mittal of M/s

     Win Drugs Ltd. had failed to appear despite repeated summons, a complaint for

     non-compliance of summons was filed against him before the Court of ACMM,

     New Delhi. The court took cognizance of the alleged offence and also issued a

     non-bailable warrant for his arrest.
7.   The respondent no. 2 was summoned and is said to have tendered a voluntary

     statement dated 13.11.2004. The respondent no. 2 stated that during the course

     of his import business, he came in contact with one person named Mohd. Abdul

     who showed him three ampoules of Buprenorphine and enquired whether the

     respondent no. 2 could procure one lakh ampoules of Buprenorphine

     manufactured by Neon Laboratories Ltd. or in the alternative, procure

     unlabelled drug ampoules of a similar size and shape having a red ring on the

     neck of the ampoules for him. Mohd. Abdul is said to have given an advance

     of Rs. 2,50,000. The respondent no. 2, thereafter, contacted the respondent no.

     1 for the purpose of procuring the same and paid him the advance amount he

     had received along with three samples of the drug which he had obtained from

     Mohd. Abdul. Initially, 2,000 and 10,000 ampoules respectively, were procured

     and delivered. On 27.09.2003, the respondent no.1 informed the respondent

     no.2 that another consignment of 40,000 ampoules had been received by him
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                     Page 6 of 189
at his office. When the respondent no.2 tried to contact the respondent no. 1 at

     around 09:15 pm, on the same day, he came to know of the fact that the office

     premises of respondent no. 1 had been raided by a government agency. The

     respondent no. 2 further stated that upon complete delivery of one lakh

     ampoules, Mohd. Abdul had promised to give him an additional amount of Rs.

     25,000. In light of the same, on 13.11.2003, the respondent no. 2 was also

     arrested for having committed the offence punishable under
Sections 22
and
29
of the NDPS Act respectively and was remanded to judicial custody.
8.   In the meanwhile, the DRI officers of the Mumbai Zonal Unit visited the

     premises of M/s Sarvodaya Enterprises, which is run by the respondent no. 3

     and during the search recovered certain documents in the presence of witnesses.

     The respondent no. 3 was then summoned. He gave a voluntary statement dated

     03.12.2003 stating that as a part of his business, his company had bought

     Buprenorphine in its powder form from M/s Pioneer Agro Industries, Mumbai

     and were selling the same to the manufacturers like M/s Win Drugs Ltd. He

     further stated that he knew the respondent no. 1 since he used to clear their

     pharmaceutical import consignments on a need basis. The respondent no. 3

     further stated that he was the one who had directed the respondent no.1 to

     contact Naresh Mittal of M/s Win Drugs Ltd for the purchase of Buprenorphine

     injections and that he had also spoken to Naresh Mittal in that regard despite

     knowing that the respondent no. 1 did not possess any licence to deal with the
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                     Page 7 of 189
said psychotropic substance. The respondent no. 3 is also said to have

     intervened when the consignments were not being received in time from M/s

     Win Drugs Ltd and used to get the delivery to the respondent no. 1 expedited.

     In the transaction in question which involved the supply of one lakh ampoules

     to the respondent no. 1, the respondent no. 3 was to get Rs. 1 Lakh from M/s

     Win Drugs Ltd in addition to some amount from the respondent no.1, for his

     involvement. As a result, on 03.12.2003, the respondent no. 3 was also arrested

     for alleged commission of the offence punishable under
Sections 22
and
29
of

     the NDPS Act respectively and was remanded to judicial custody.
The file be sent immediately to the said Court.”
17. In such circumstances referred to above, the appellant is here before this Court

      with the present appeal.
18. On 07.10.2004, the Delhi Zonal Unit of the Narcotics Control Bureau

      (hereinafter, the “NCB”) received an information from the Ahmedabad Zonal
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                    Page 16 of 189
Unit that they had recovered and seized 50,000 ampoules of Buprenorphine and

     during the course of their investigation it was revealed that a huge quantity of

     these ampoules was also supplied by M/s Rusan Health Care Ltd. to their

     stockists in Delhi. One Monish Nayyer the proprietor of M/s Belsons was

     summoned in this regard. M/s Belsons had originally distributed the said

     ampoules to M/s Rusan Health Care Ltd. In his statement, he disclosed that his

     firm had a drug licence and therefore, they had received large quantities of the

     said psychotropic substance from their suppliers out of which the major chunk

     was sold to one M/s International Drugs. Sajesh Sharma (hereinafter, the

     “respondent no. 1” had taken delivery of the substance on behalf of M/s

     International Drugs. Pursuant to this information, summons were issued to the

     respondent no. 1 who admitted that his firm was selling the ampoules of

     Buprenorphine Hydrochloride/bunogesic injections after purchasing them from

     M/s Belsons with a valid invoice. The respondent no. 1 then stated that he had

     sold 2,50,400 injections to a person named Shakeel without an invoice or

     consignment note as required under Rule 67 of the NDPS Rules and that he was

     not aware whether Shakeel had a valid drug licence or permission in accordance

     with law. In the absence of any further information on Shakeel, it is the case of

     the appellant that no further action could be taken against him. However, on

     09.10.2004, the respondent no. 1 was arrested and remanded to judicial

     custody.
23. In such circumstance referred to above, the appellant is here before this Court

     with the present appeal.","25. It was submitted that the respondent no. 3 and respondent nos. 1 and 2

     respectively were granted bail by the High Court vide its orders dated

     11.01.2005 and 22.08.2005 respectively. However, in doing so, the High Court

     had observed that Buprenorphine Hydrochloride is beyond the pale of Chapter

     VII of the NDPS Rules and owing to it being a Schedule H drug under the D&C

     Act and its Rules, the offence under
Section 8
of the NDPS Act would not be

     made out. Consequently, it was observed that the accused cannot be punished

     under
Sections 22
and
29
of the NDPS Act respectively. Being aggrieved by

     the aforesaid observation made by the High Court, the appellant filed a Special

     Leave Petition against both the orders granting bail to the respondents and this

     Court vide its order dated 31.03.2006 had clarified and directed that the

     observations made by the High Court shall not have any binding effect when

     the matter is finally considered before the Special Judge on merits.
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                    Page 23 of 189
31. Mr. Arvind Kumar Sharma, the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the

     appellant herein adopted the submissions canvassed by the learned ASG. In

     addition, the counsel submitted that there is nothing to indicate that Rule 64 is

     the “governing rule” under Chapter VII of the NDPS Rules and since Rule 64
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                       Page 26 of 189
pertains only to Schedule I substances, all the other rules must also necessarily

      apply to Schedule I substances. The language of Rules 66 and 67 respectively,

      is unambiguous and they clearly apply to “any psychotropic substance” which

      cannot be read to exclude the substances which only find mention in the
Schedule to the NDPS Act
. Furthermore, Rules 65 and 66 respectively, adopt

      the provisions of the D&C Rules rather than excluding it. Therefore, the

      resultant effect must be that the contravention of the D&C Rules would ipso

      facto tantamount to a violation of Rules 65 and 66 of the NDPS Rules

      respectively, thereby attracting punishment under the
NDPS Act
.
32. It was submitted that certain drugs are regulated by both the
NDPS Act
and the

      D&C Act simultaneously since they can be used as both psychotropic

      substances as well as medicinal drugs in view of their narcotic properties. This

      does not necessarily mean that an accused would be absolved of his guilt under

      the
NDPS Act
once the substance finds mention under the D&C Rules.
36. It was submitted that the decision of the Delhi High Court in Rajesh Sharma

     (supra) cannot be said to be inapplicable solely because it was rendered in the

     context of a bail application. It was submitted that while dealing with an

     application for bail under the
NDPS Act
, the Court must get over the rigour

     contained in
Section 37(1)(b)(ii)
of the NDPS Act. Therefore, only after giving

     an opportunity to the Public Prosecutor and recording a satisfaction to the effect

     that there are reasonable grounds for believing that the accused is not guilty of
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                      Page 28 of 189
such offence, a decision to grant bail is arrived at. Hence, the findings rendered

     in a bail application are also extremely relevant while deciding the question

     whether an offence under
Section 8
of the NDPS Act is made out or not.
29. Moreover, the judgment of the Full Bench has attained finality.
            The special leave petition has been dismissed. The subsequent
            Division Bench, therefore, could not have said as to whether the
            law declared by the Full Bench would have a prospective
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                    Page 106 of 189
operation or not. The law declared by a court will have a
            retrospective effect if not otherwise stated to be so specifically.
            The Full Bench having not said so, the subsequent Division Bench
            did not have the jurisdiction in that behalf.”

                                                      (Emphasis supplied)
42. The learned counsel for the parties have also briefly
              referred to
Section 6
of the General Clauses Act, 1897. It would
              be appropriate to reproduce the said provision hereunder:","9.   The Chemical Examiner of the Central Revenue Control Laboratory, New

     Delhi, vide his report dated 20.11.2003 opined that, upon chemical analysis

     conducted by him, the samples were found to be of Buprenorphine which is a

     psychotropic substance under the
NDPS Act
. It is the case of the appellant that

     despite their best efforts, Naresh Mittal of M/s Win Drugs Ltd. could not be

     summoned and therefore, it was decided that the prosecution qua him and all

     other concerned persons would be considered as and when they would be

     available for enquiry.
11.   On 03.02.2005, the Special Court observed that Buprenorphine is a

      psychotropic substance as per the
Schedule to the NDPS Act
and its

      commercial quantity is fixed at 20 gms. The test memo as regards the present

      seizure indicated that the contents of each of the ampoules varied between 0.23

      mg to 0.34 mg. On a consideration of the above and the attendant

      circumstances, including that the respondent no. 1 did not possess any

      permission or licence for dealing in the substance and that all the respondents

      had conceded to their involvement in the crime, the Special Judge held that a

      prima facie contravention of
Section 22
along with a case of conspiracy under
Section 29
of the NDPS Act was made out. The Special Judge was also prima

      facie of the view that meticulous examination of the evidence is not required to

      be assessed at the stage of framing of charge and a mere strong suspicion of

      involvement in the crime is sufficient. Stating so, charge was directed to be

      framed. The charge was formally framed by the Special Judge on 08.02.2005.
24. Mr. Vikramjit Banerjee, the learned Additional Solicitor General appearing

     on behalf of the appellant, submitted that, in the present case, there was a

     recovery of 40,001 injections of buprenorphine, which is a psychotropic

     substance mentioned in the
Schedule to the NDPS Act
. Therefore, the

     Respondent could be said to have contravened
section 8(c)
of the NDPS Act

     which prohibits the production, manufacturing, possession, selling,
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                   Page 22 of 189
purchasing, transporting, warehousing, using, consuming, importing inter-
33. In the last, both the counsels prayed that the impugned orders of the High

      Court be set aside and the appeals be allowed.
ii.    Submissions on behalf of the Respondent(s)
34.   Mr. Yash Pal Dhingra, the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the

      respondents submitted that the drug/substance in question is covered by the
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                      Page 27 of 189
exception to
Section 8
of the NDPS Act i.e., non-applicability of the prohibition

     in case the substance is to be used for “medical or scientific purposes”.

     Furthermore, he argued that an offence under
Section 8
cannot be said to have

     been committed unless the substance also finds mention under Schedule I of

     the NDPS Rules. To fortify his contention, the learned counsel placed reliance

     on the decisions of the Delhi High Court in
Rajender Gupta & Ors. v. State
reported in 2005 SCC OnLine Del 873 and Rajesh Sharma v. Union of India

     reported in 2009 SCC OnLine Del 1330 along with the decision of this Court

     in Rajesh Kumar Gupta (supra).
37. In the last, the counsel submitted that there being no merit in the appeals, those

     may be dismissed.
49. With respect to the export of substances mentioned in Schedule III,
Article 12
states that exporters must draw up a declaration in triplicate, on a form, which

     contains information including the name and address of the exporter and

     importer, the international non-proprietary name or the designation of the

     substance in the Schedule, the quantity and the pharmaceutical form in which

     the substance is exported, the name of the preparation, if any, and the date of

     despatch. Exporters must furnish two copies of the declaration to the competent

     authorities of their country or region and attach the third copy to their

     consignment. Thereafter, the State from whose territory a Schedule III
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                    Page 38 of 189
substance has been exported, shall not later than 90 days after the date of

      despatch, send to the competent authorities of the importing country or region,

      one copy of the declaration received from the exporter by registered mail with

      return of receipt requested. The States may also require that after the

      consignment has been received, the importer shall transmit the copy of the

      declaration accompanying the consignment which has been duly endorsed

      stating the quantities received and the date of the receipt, to the competent

      authorities of the importing country or region.","13.   The appellant had preferred a petition for Special Leave to Appeal against both

      the orders of the High Court granting bail to the respondents. Vide order dated

      31.03.2006, this Court declined to interfere with the grant of bail, however,

      made it clear that the observations of the High Court that Buprenorphine

      Hydrochloride would not be covered under the
NDPS Act
and that no offence

      under the
NDPS Act
and its rules was made out, would not have any persuasive

      effect when the matter would be finally considered before the Special Judge on

      merits.
38. Having heard the learned counsel appearing for the parties and having gone

     through the materials on record, the following questions fall for our

     consideration:
43.   The Preamble to the Convention on Psychotropic Substances, 1971

      (hereinafter, the “Convention”), elucidates that the Convention was adopted

      keeping in mind the primary concern as regards the health and welfare of

      mankind along with the public health and social problems which arise as a

      result of abuse of certain psychotropic substances. It called for a collective and

      determinative action from all States to prevent and combat the abuse of such

      substances and the rise in illicit trade thereof. Rigorous measures were

      considered necessary to restrict the use of psychotropic substances to legitimate

      purposes while simultaneously acknowledging that their use for medical and

      scientific purposes must not be unduly restricted or curtailed. The Convention

      is annexed with four Schedules containing controlled psychotropic substances,
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                       Page 33 of 189
where arguably, Schedule I substances are the most restricted while Schedule

     IV substances are the least restricted.
50.   On a conspectus of the aforementioned Articles of the Convention, it can be

      seen that the substances mentioned in Schedules I, II, III and IV respectively

      are subject to different treatment and restrictions on their manufacture, use,

      possession, import and export, amongst others. While Schedule I substances

      are to be used for limited purposes by the authorized persons under a special

      licence or prior authorization, the substances mentioned under Schedule II, III

      and IV respectively, are used for a comparatively wider range of purposes by

      the licence holders and its supply is allowed to be made pursuant to a medical

      prescription. Therefore, it cannot be stated that the substances other than the

      Schedule I substances are completely unregulated or allowed to be dealt with

      in any manner whatsoever. These substances also have the potential to be
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                    Page 39 of 189
misused or abused and hence are subject to certain restrictions and procedural

      requirements albeit not up to the standards as strict as the Schedule I substances.
55. It is just not enough to prove or establish that the narcotic drug or psychotropic

     substance is capable of being used for a medical or scientific purpose. That

     would give unnecessary leeway to persons to indiscriminately deal with

     narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances under the garb that they could also

     be potentially used for medical or scientific purposes. Moreover, several of

     these drugs and substances are inherently of such a nature that they have

     widespread medicinal and scientific applications. Therefore, an expansive

     interpretation of the exception that the mere potential for usage of the narcotic

     drug or psychotropic substance ,for medical or scientific purpose, is sufficient

     would run counter to the object of the Act which seeks to act as a deterrent to

     the widespread dealing in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances. What

     must, therefore, be proved to take the benefit of the exception is that the

     narcotic drug or psychotropic substances was being dealt in for a specified and

     real medical or scientific purpose, in the manner and to the extent provided by

     the provisions of the Act, the rules and orders made thereunder and, in case

     such provisions imposes any requirement by way of licence, permit or

     authorisation, in accordance with the terms and conditions of such licence,

     permit or authorisation.
15. In light of the above observations, we find that the decision
              rendered by the High Court holding that the respondent-
92. The operation of a newly enacted statute or rule must not be confused with the

     effect of a judgment. A judgement or decision which interprets a statute or

     provision thereof declares the meaning of the statute as it should be construed

     from the date of its enactment. In other words, the judgment declares what the

     legislature had said at the time when the law was promulgated and therefore, it

     has retrospective effect. On the contrary, it is the statute or the rule which is

     presumed to be prospective unless expressly made retrospective. What follows

     from the same, is that a decision or judgment enunciating a principle of law is

     applicable to all cases irrespective of the stage of pendency before different

     forums since what has been enunciated is the meaning of the law which existed

     from the inception of the concerned statute or provision. What has been

     declared to be the law of the land must be held to have always been the law of

     the land. This conclusion also stems from the rationale that the duty of the court

     is not to “pronounce a new law but to maintain and expound the old one”. The

     judge rather than being the creator of the law, is only its discoverer.
25. In service matters, this Court on a number of occasions have
            passed orders on equitable consideration. But the same would not
            mean that whenever a law is declared, it will have an effect only
            because it has taken a different view from the earlier one. In those
            cases it is categorically stated that it would have prospective
            operation.
44. The need to make the law
laid down in
Mohd. Ramzan Khan
case [(1991) 1 SCC 588 : 1991 SCC (L&S) 612 : (1991) 16 ATC
           505] prospective in operation requires no emphasis. As pointed
           out above, in view of the unsettled position of the law on the
           subject, the authorities/managements all over the country had
           proceeded on the basis that there was no need to furnish a copy of
           the report of the enquiry officer to the delinquent employee and
           innumerable employees have been punished without giving them
           the copies of the reports. In some of the cases, the orders of
           punishment have long since become final while other cases are
           pending in courts at different stages. In many of the cases, the
           misconduct has been grave and in others the denial on the part of
           the management to furnish the report would ultimately prove to be
           no more than a technical mistake. To reopen all the disciplinary
           proceedings now would result in grave prejudice to administration
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                  Page 123 of 189
which will far outweigh the benefit to the employees concerned.
114. Another pertinent question for the purpose of our discussion would be, whether

     the prospective operation of a particular decision delivered in the past can be

     decided subsequently by a different bench, which is concerned with the same

     question of law, especially when the previous decision is silent on the question

     of prospectivity or retrospectivity. There has been some debate as to whether

     this would amount to a review of
the said decision
under a non-review

     jurisdiction.
118. As repeatedly discussed in the aforesaid parts of this judgment, the doctrine of

     prospective overruling was designed to prevent the unravelling of past

     transactions and the re-opening of matters which have already attained finality.

     In so far as the applicability of the doctrine or a rationale similar to it, to matters

     pertaining to criminal law are concerned, this Court has in the past held that

     acquittals granted on the basis of the earlier position/interpretation of law must

     not be interfered with.
124.
Article 20(1)
of the Constitution of India reads that – “No person shall be

     convicted of any offence except for violation of a law in force at the time of the

     commission of the act charged as an offence, nor be subjected to a penalty
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                      Page 149 of 189
greater than that which might have been inflicted under the law in force at the

     time of the commission of the offence.”. It is therefore, set in stone under the

     constitutional principles of our legal system that it would be absolutely

     impermissible for an accused to be convicted of an offence under any Act, if

     his act was not an offence at the time during which it was committed. Herein,

     the import of the words “law in force at the time of the commission” is

     especially important. It has been detailed by us, with sufficient clarity, in the

     preceding paragraphs, that judges do not make law but only find the right law.

     This is precisely the reason behind retrospectively applying any overruling

     decision as a default rule. However, can the overruling judgment and its

     declaration of law be considered to be the “law in force at the time of the

     commission”? Such a question is required to be considered by us more

     particularly as regards matters which pertain to substantive law, like the present

     one. Herein, the controversy is whether the dealing in of psychotropic

     substances which are mentioned under the
Schedule to the NDPS Act
and not

     under Schedule I of the NDPS Rules would constitute an offence or not. While

     the decision in Rajesh Kumar Gupta (supra) answered in the negative, the

     subsequent decision in Sanjeev V. Deshpande (supra) answered affirmatively

     and overruled the decision in Rajesh Kumar Gupta (supra). Following the

     general rule, the exposition of law in Sanjeev V. Deshpande (supra) is required

     to be considered as the right position of law from its inception. However, we
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                     Page 150 of 189
have to examine whether holding so would result in any implications on the

     fundamental rights of the accused, in the specific facts and attendant

     circumstances that accompany the present appeals.
134. The Blackstonian theory also lends great support to our conclusion since it

     underscores the principle that it is not the function of the court to pronounce a

     “new rule” but to maintain and expound the “old one”. Therefore, the

     overruling of a decision cannot be equated to the creation of a new law. The

     correct principle of law is merely clarified and applied retrospectively.

     Therefore, in the circumstances of the instant case, it cannot be said that a new

     offence was “created” subsequently. It is to be considered as always have

     existed. The offence under
Section 8
as expounded in
Sanjeev V Deshpande
(supra) was not introduced out of thin air and it cannot be said that its existence

     as construed in the aforesaid decision was undeniably absent from the scheme

     of the provisions under the
NDPS Act
. We have elaborated with sufficient

     detail, by even exhaustively and conscientiously discussing the Articles of the

     Convention of Psychotropic Substances, 1971 which motivated the enactment

     of the
NDPS Act
along with the object of the
NDPS Act
and concluding that it

     would be a grave error to assume that the law was ever otherwise.
137. We find it necessary to reiterate that acquittals which have already been

     recorded and have attained finality would not be unsettled in light of the

     overruling decision or the observations made by us. If it were a reverse scenario

     i.e., if the decision in Rajesh Kumar Gupta (supra) led to the conviction of

     several accused and then subsequently, the effect of the ratio in Sanjeev V.

     Deshpande (supra) was such that those accused were to be acquitted because
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                    Page 168 of 189
an offence was not made, we would have, without an iota of doubt leaned in

     favour of those matters being reconsidered and the convictions also being re-

     examined in light of the clarification given in the subsequent decision.

     However, presently, the situation not being such, we do not wish to subject any

     accused who has been acquitted, to trial again.
154. We are in agreement with the view that once charges have been framed by the

     Trial Court in exercise of the powers under
Section 228
CrPC, the accused

     cannot thereafter be discharged, be it through an exercise of the powers under

     Sections 227 or 216
CrPC
. It is reiterated that the language of
Section 216
CrPC

     provides only for the addition and alteration of charge(s) and not for the

     deletion or discharge of an accused. If the Legislature had intended to empower

     the Trial Court with the power to delete a charge at that stage, the same would

     have been expressly and unambiguously stated. Therefore, at such a stage of

     the trial, the accused must necessarily either be convicted or acquitted of the

     charges that were so framed against him. No shortcuts must be allowed.
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                   Page 184 of 189
155. In both the appeals before us i.e. Criminal Appeal Nos. 1319 of 2013 and 272

     of 2014 respectively, the Trial Courts vide their orders dated 30.11.2006 and

     17.04.2010 have in effect deleted the charge framed for the offence under the

     provisions of the
NDPS Act
and then transferred the file to the Court of the

     Metropolitan Magistrate for proceeding in accordance with the provisions of

     the D&C Act, without arriving at a decision to acquit the accused as regards

     the charges already framed under the provisions of the
NDPS Act
. The same is

     impermissible under the scheme of our criminal procedure code and both the

     Trial Courts could be said to have committed a grave error while reaching the

     conclusion that as the offences were not triable by them, the case should be

     transferred to the court of the Metropolitan Magistrate respectively.","In these circumstances it would be appropriate if the application
          under
Section 216
of the Code of Criminal Procedure which has
          been filed by the petitioner is disposed of taking into account, inter
          alia
,
the said decision
of this Court. While disposing of the
          application under
Section 216
Code of Criminal Procedure, the
          learned Sessions Courts shall not be influenced by what has been
          held in the impugned order and shall consider the entire issue
          afresh. The Learned Sessions Court shall decide the application
          under
Section 216
Code of Criminal Procedure first before
          proceeding further with the matter. It is, of course, goes without
          saying that not only the counsel for the petitioner but the counsel
          for the State shall also be heard on all submissions. In view of
          above, terms this revision petition stands disposed of.”

                                                     (Emphasis supplied)
16. In view of the foregoing discussion, the Petition is devoid of
           any merit; the same is accordingly dismissed.
5. The prospective declaration of law is a devise innovated by the
           Apex Court to avoid reopening of settled issues and to prevent
           multiplicity of proceedings. It is also a devise adopted to avoid
           uncertainty and avoidable litigation. By the very object of
           prospective declaration of law, it is deemed that all actions taken
           contrary to the declaration of law prior to its date of declaration
           are validated. This is done in the larger public interest.
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                     Page 110 of 189
Therefore, the subordinate forums which are legally bound to
           apply the declaration of law made by this Court are also duty-
           bound to apply such dictum to cases which would arise in future
           only. In matters where decisions opposed to the said principle
           have been taken prior to such declaration of law cannot be
           interfered with on the basis of such declaration of law. In the
           instant case, both decisions of the DPC as well as the appointing
           authority being prior to the judgment in Sabharwal case [(1995)
           2 SCC 745 : 1995 SCC (L&S) 548 : (1995) 29 ATC 481] we are
           of the opinion that the Tribunal was in error in applying this
           decision. For this reason, these appeals succeed and are hereby
           allowed; setting aside the orders and directions made by the
           Tribunal in OAs Nos. 186 of 1994 and 961 of 1995.”

                                                    (Emphasis supplied)
Both administrative reality and public interests do not, therefore,
           require that the orders of punishment passed prior to the decision
           in
Mohd. Ramzan Khan
case [(1991) 1 SCC 588 : 1991 SCC
           (L&S) 612 : (1991) 16 ATC 505] without furnishing the report of
           the enquiry officer should be disturbed and the disciplinary
           proceedings which gave rise to the said orders should be reopened
           on that account. Hence we hold as above.”

                                                   (Emphasis supplied)

19. For the reasons stated above, we dispose of these appeals by
           merely laying down the correct proposition of law but do not make
           any consequential orders setting aside the acquittal of any of the
           respondents or sending back the cases to the courts below or
           convicting any of them by an order of this Court.”

Similarly, under
Section 16(1)(a)(i)
any person who sells
           adulterated food commits an offence and is punishable therein.
           The sugar which is the commodity before us is food under
Section
           2(3)
of the Act. We have already pointed out that sugar by itself is
           an article used as food or at any rate it is an article which
           ordinarily enters into or is used in the composition or preparation
           of human food. In this case the sale was for analysis and the article
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                     Page 170 of 189
was an article of food and in view of the concurrent findings of
           both the courts that it was adulterated, the respondents have
           contravened
Sections 16(1)(a)(i)
of the Act. Hence it must be held
           that the respondents are technically guilty of the offence with
           which they were charged and they have been wrongly acquitted by
           the High Court and the District Magistrate. But in view of the fact
           that the appellant has argued the appeal only as a test case and
           does not challenge the acquittal of the respondents, we merely set
           aside the order and judgment of the High Court. But we may make
           it clear that apart from holding the respondents technically guilty,
           we are not setting aside the order of acquittal passed in their
           favour.”
                                                    (Emphasis supplied)
140.
In
Cherukattil Gopalan
(supra), this Court did not set aside the order of

     acquittal which was passed in favour of the accused but at the same time,

     streamlined the position of law in that regard and only set aside the order and

     judgment of the High Court.
Along similar lines, while we are refraining from

     directing that the orders of acquittal (if any) passed due to the decision in

     Rajesh Kumar Gupta (supra) be disturbed, in so far as the accused person

     before us are concerned, it would have been appropriate to declare them to be

     technically guilty of the offence under
Section 8
of the NDPS Act, had they

     been acquitted. However, what has been brought out from the facts of the

     appeals before us, is that the accused persons were not acquitted but discharged

     due to the decision in Rajesh Kumar Gupta (supra). Therefore, there arises no

     occasion for us to hold them technically guilty of the offences under the

     provisions of the
NDPS Act
that they were charged with. At this juncture, the
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                   Page 171 of 189
obvious next step would be for the trial qua all the accused before us to be

       commenced in accordance with law.


(1) Any Court may alter or add to any charge at any time before
             judgment is pronounced.
(2) Every such alteration or addition shall be read and explained
             to the accused.
(3) If the alteration or addition to a charge is such that proceeding
             immediately with the trial is not likely, in the opinion of the Court,
             to prejudice the accused in his defence or the prosecutor in the
             conduct of the case, the Court may, in its discretion, after such
             alteration or addition has been made, proceed with the trial as if
             the altered or added charge had been the original charge.

             (4) If the alteration or addition is such that proceeding
             immediately with the trial is likely, in the opinion of the Court, to
             prejudice the accused or the prosecutor as aforesaid, the Court
             may either direct a new trial or adjourn the trial for such period
             as may be necessary.
(5) If the offence stated in the altered or added charge is one for
             the prosecution of which previous sanction is necessary, the case
             shall not be proceeded with until such sanction is obtained, unless
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                       Page 172 of 189
sanction has been already obtained for a prosecution on the same
           facts as those on which the altered or added charge is founded.”

                                                   (Emphasis supplied)



Unfortunately, such applications are being filed in the trial courts
           sometimes in ignorance of law and sometimes deliberately to delay
           the proceedings. Once such applications though untenable are
           filed, the trial courts have no alternative but to decide them, and
           then again such orders would be challenged before the higher
           courts, and the whole criminal trial would get derailed. Suffice it
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                     Page 181 of 189
to say that such practice is highly deplorable, and if followed,
           should be dealt with sternly by the courts.”

                                                   (Emphasis supplied)
E.    CONCLUSION

161. We are, therefore, of the view that both the Trial Court and the High Court

     committed an error in holding that the offence under the provisions of the
NDPS Act
is not made out. The Trial Courts in both the appeals could also not

     have discharged/deleted the charge under the
NDPS Act
framed against the
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                   Page 188 of 189
accused persons while disposing of an application under
Section 216
CrPC.
This is something not permissible within our criminal procedure and the High

     Court unfortunately failed to take notice of this aspect.
162. In view of the law expounded by us, since the accused concerned in both the

     appeals were not acquitted in their respective trials, we direct that they be tried

     by the concerned Special Judge, NDPS, in accordance with law. The Trial

     Courts are directed to proceed with the trial and conclude it expeditiously.
163. With the aforesaid directions, we allow both the appeals filed by the appellants

     and set aside the impugned orders passed by the High Court.
164. We direct the Registry to send one copy each of this judgment to all the High

     Courts.

165. Pending application(s), if any, shall stand disposed of.

Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                     Page 189 of 189","The DRI(HQ) officers recovered 25 corrugated card board cartons which

     contained small packets, each having ten unlabelled glass ampoules with a

     water coloured liquid, along with several sheets of printed labels which read as

     “Buprenorphine Hydrochloride”. They also recovered one labelled glass

     ampoule containing the same coloured liquid from the table drawer of the

     respondent no. 1. Upon preparing a detailed inventory, it was stated that 1
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                     Page 4 of 189
labelled and 40,000 unlabelled glass ampoules containing Buprenorphine

     Hydrochloride which is a substance listed in the
Schedule to the NDPS Act
were recovered. Since the respondent no. 1 was unable to provide any

     permission or licence for the possession of the recovered glass ampoules, they

     were seized under the provisions of the
NDPS Act
. The samples were drawn

     and the test memo was prepared in the presence of the respondent no. 1 and the

     witnesses. On 27.09.2003, i.e., on the same day, the officers of CEC, Rohtak

     are said to have seized 23400 injections of Buprenorphine along with 100

     grams of Buprenorphine in its powder form, from M/s Win Drugs Ltd at Jind,

     Haryana as well.
5.   In response to the summons issued, the respondent no. 1 appeared and is said

     to have made a voluntary statement in writing dated 28.09.2003 which

     mentioned that during the course of his business as a customs clearing agent,

     he came in contact with one Mohd. Shebar Khan (hereinafter, “respondent no.

     2”) who handled the customs clearance of the drugs and medicines on behalf

     of Devang Bipin Parekh (hereinafter, “respondent no. 3”) of M/s Sarvodiya

     Enterprises, Mumbai. The statement further revealed the fact that the

     respondents were collectively involved in the illegal manufacture, storage,

     transport, sale and purchase of Buprenorphine Hydrochloride along with one

     Naresh Mittal of Win Drugs Ltd.
6.   On 28.09.2003, the respondent no. 1 was arrested for the alleged commission

     of the offence punishable under
Sections 22
and
29
of the NDPS Act

     respectively and was remanded to judicial custody. Since Naresh Mittal of M/s

     Win Drugs Ltd. had failed to appear despite repeated summons, a complaint for

     non-compliance of summons was filed against him before the Court of ACMM,

     New Delhi. The court took cognizance of the alleged offence and also issued a

     non-bailable warrant for his arrest.
7.   The respondent no. 2 was summoned and is said to have tendered a voluntary

     statement dated 13.11.2004. The respondent no. 2 stated that during the course

     of his import business, he came in contact with one person named Mohd. Abdul

     who showed him three ampoules of Buprenorphine and enquired whether the

     respondent no. 2 could procure one lakh ampoules of Buprenorphine

     manufactured by Neon Laboratories Ltd. or in the alternative, procure

     unlabelled drug ampoules of a similar size and shape having a red ring on the

     neck of the ampoules for him. Mohd. Abdul is said to have given an advance

     of Rs. 2,50,000. The respondent no. 2, thereafter, contacted the respondent no.

     1 for the purpose of procuring the same and paid him the advance amount he

     had received along with three samples of the drug which he had obtained from

     Mohd. Abdul. Initially, 2,000 and 10,000 ampoules respectively, were procured

     and delivered. On 27.09.2003, the respondent no.1 informed the respondent

     no.2 that another consignment of 40,000 ampoules had been received by him
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                     Page 6 of 189
at his office. When the respondent no.2 tried to contact the respondent no. 1 at

     around 09:15 pm, on the same day, he came to know of the fact that the office

     premises of respondent no. 1 had been raided by a government agency. The

     respondent no. 2 further stated that upon complete delivery of one lakh

     ampoules, Mohd. Abdul had promised to give him an additional amount of Rs.

     25,000. In light of the same, on 13.11.2003, the respondent no. 2 was also

     arrested for having committed the offence punishable under
Sections 22
and
29
of the NDPS Act respectively and was remanded to judicial custody.
8.   In the meanwhile, the DRI officers of the Mumbai Zonal Unit visited the

     premises of M/s Sarvodaya Enterprises, which is run by the respondent no. 3

     and during the search recovered certain documents in the presence of witnesses.

     The respondent no. 3 was then summoned. He gave a voluntary statement dated

     03.12.2003 stating that as a part of his business, his company had bought

     Buprenorphine in its powder form from M/s Pioneer Agro Industries, Mumbai

     and were selling the same to the manufacturers like M/s Win Drugs Ltd. He

     further stated that he knew the respondent no. 1 since he used to clear their

     pharmaceutical import consignments on a need basis. The respondent no. 3

     further stated that he was the one who had directed the respondent no.1 to

     contact Naresh Mittal of M/s Win Drugs Ltd for the purchase of Buprenorphine

     injections and that he had also spoken to Naresh Mittal in that regard despite

     knowing that the respondent no. 1 did not possess any licence to deal with the
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                     Page 7 of 189
said psychotropic substance. The respondent no. 3 is also said to have

     intervened when the consignments were not being received in time from M/s

     Win Drugs Ltd and used to get the delivery to the respondent no. 1 expedited.

     In the transaction in question which involved the supply of one lakh ampoules

     to the respondent no. 1, the respondent no. 3 was to get Rs. 1 Lakh from M/s

     Win Drugs Ltd in addition to some amount from the respondent no.1, for his

     involvement. As a result, on 03.12.2003, the respondent no. 3 was also arrested

     for alleged commission of the offence punishable under
Sections 22
and
29
of

     the NDPS Act respectively and was remanded to judicial custody.
The file be sent immediately to the said Court.”
17. In such circumstances referred to above, the appellant is here before this Court

      with the present appeal.
18. On 07.10.2004, the Delhi Zonal Unit of the Narcotics Control Bureau

      (hereinafter, the “NCB”) received an information from the Ahmedabad Zonal
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                    Page 16 of 189
Unit that they had recovered and seized 50,000 ampoules of Buprenorphine and

     during the course of their investigation it was revealed that a huge quantity of

     these ampoules was also supplied by M/s Rusan Health Care Ltd. to their

     stockists in Delhi. One Monish Nayyer the proprietor of M/s Belsons was

     summoned in this regard. M/s Belsons had originally distributed the said

     ampoules to M/s Rusan Health Care Ltd. In his statement, he disclosed that his

     firm had a drug licence and therefore, they had received large quantities of the

     said psychotropic substance from their suppliers out of which the major chunk

     was sold to one M/s International Drugs. Sajesh Sharma (hereinafter, the

     “respondent no. 1” had taken delivery of the substance on behalf of M/s

     International Drugs. Pursuant to this information, summons were issued to the

     respondent no. 1 who admitted that his firm was selling the ampoules of

     Buprenorphine Hydrochloride/bunogesic injections after purchasing them from

     M/s Belsons with a valid invoice. The respondent no. 1 then stated that he had

     sold 2,50,400 injections to a person named Shakeel without an invoice or

     consignment note as required under Rule 67 of the NDPS Rules and that he was

     not aware whether Shakeel had a valid drug licence or permission in accordance

     with law. In the absence of any further information on Shakeel, it is the case of

     the appellant that no further action could be taken against him. However, on

     09.10.2004, the respondent no. 1 was arrested and remanded to judicial

     custody.
23. In such circumstance referred to above, the appellant is here before this Court

     with the present appeal.J.B. PARDIWALA, J.:

10. On 25.03.2004, a criminal complaint as regards the offence punishable under
Sections 22
and
29
of the NDPS Act respectively was filed against the

     respondents by one Mr. R. Roy (hereinafter, the “complainant”), an
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                     Page 8 of 189
intelligence officer of the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence, New Delhi,

      (hereinafter, the “appellant”) before the Special Court for NDPS cases, New

      Delhi.

12.   The respondents applied for bail before the Special Judge and the same was

      declined. However, the High Court vide a common Judgment and Order dated

      11.01.2005 granted bail to the respondent no. 3 along with several others. The
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                      Page 9 of 189
respondent nos. 1 and 2 respectively, had also moved the High Court for bail

     and vide a common Judgment and Order dated 22.08.2005, the High Court

     stated that no offence under the
NDPS Act
was made out and directed that the

     respondent nos. 1 and 2 be released on bail upon furnishing a personal bond in

     the sum of Rs. 25,000 with one surety of the like amount to the satisfaction of

     the concerned trial court. The High Court in its common Judgement and Order

     dated 22.08.2005 had framed two questions of law for the purpose of

     considering the plea for bail – (a) Whether Buprenorphine Hydrochloride is a

     “psychotropic substance” within the meaning of the
NDPS Act
?, and (b) If yes,

     whether Buprenorphine Hydrochloride is a “psychotropic substance” to which

     Chapter VII of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Rules, 1985

     (hereinafter, the “NDPS Rules”) apply and to what effect? The first question

     was answered in the affirmative, however, on the second question, it was

     concluded that since Buprenorphine Hydrochloride is a psychotropic substance

     not included under Schedule I of the NDPS Rules, its manufacture, possession,

     sale and transport etc. would neither be prohibited nor regulated by the NDPS

     Rules and consequently by the
NDPS Act
. It was observed that an examination

     of Schedule H of the Drugs and Cosmetics Rules, 1940 (hereinafter, the “D&C

     Rules”) made it clear that Buprenorphine Hydrochloride was listed therein as

     a “Prescription Drug” and therefore, the offence would fall within the rigours

     of the D&C Act and its Rules.
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                   Page 10 of 189
14. The respondents thereafter preferred an application under
Section 216
of the

      Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (hereinafter, the “
CrPC
”) before the Special

      Judge for amendment/alteration of charge. Before filing the application under
Section 216
CrPC, the respondent no. 3 had filed a Criminal Revision Petition

      No. 204 of 2005 before the High Court challenging the order dated 03.02.2005

      and 08.02.2005 respectively, which framed charge against the respondents

      herein. Vide judgment and order dated 01.08.2006, the High Court disposed of

      the petition by observing that the application under Section 216 pending before

      the Special Judge shall be decided first before the matter is proceeded with. The

      relevant observations are as follows:
15.   The Special Judge heard the submissions of the counsel with respect to the
Section 216
CrPC application made before him. Vide order dated 30.11.2006,

      the Special Judge echoed the reasoning adopted by the High Court while

      granting bail to the respondents and also arrived at the conclusion that the

      respondents are to be tried under the D&C Act and the Rules thereunder. The

      Special Judge allowed the application filed under
Section 216
CrPC taking the

      view that since the offence under the
NDPS Act
was not made out, the file be
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                       Page 12 of 189
sent to the ACMM, New Delhi for further proceedings. The relevant

      observations are as thus:
ii.   Criminal Appeal No. 272 of 2014
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                     Page 17 of 189
19. On 02.03.2005, the appellant through its Intelligence Officer filed a complaint

     against the respondent no. 1 under
Sections 8(c)
and
22(c)
of the NDPS Act

     respectively and on 04.05.2005, upon a prima facie case being made against

     the accused, a charge for the offence under
Section 22(c)
was framed. On

     28.11.2006, in the midst of the trial and during the stage of recording evidence,

     the respondent filed an application under
Section 216
CrPC drawing the

     attention of the Special Judge to the decision rendered by the Delhi High Court

     in
Rajender Gupta v. State
reported in 2005 SCC OnLine Del 873 which held

     that dealing in substances mentioned in the
Schedule to the NDPS Act
and not

     mentioned in Schedule I of the NDPS Rules would not constitute an offence

     under the
NDPS Act
. As a consequence, the respondent no. 1 prayed that the

     charge be altered and the case be remitted to the appropriate court for trial under

     the D&C Act.


30. The offences under
Drugs and Cosmetics Act
and Rules are
           triable by the court of Metropolitan Magistrate and not by the
           Special Hon'ble or Court of Sessions. As such this case is
           remanded to Ld Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Delhi to deal with
           the case in accordance with law. Ld CMM may also assign the
           case to any other Metropolitan Magistrate as may deem fit. It is
           made clear that question of limitation would not stand in the
           present case.
Parties are directed to appear before Ld CMM on 07.05.2010.”

C.    ISSUES FOR DETERMINATION


42. There exist three Conventions (collectively referred to as the “International

      Drug Control Conventions”) under the auspices of the United Nations which

      form the current normative framework for the control of narcotic drugs,

      psychotropic substances and precursor chemicals. They are :- The Single

      Convention on Narcotic Drugs, 1961; The Convention on Psychotropic

      Substances of 1971; and the United Nations Convention against the Illicit

      Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances of 1988. India has

      acceded to and is therefore, a party to the abovementioned International Drug

      Control Convention framework.

Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                    Page 55 of 1899.   The Chemical Examiner of the Central Revenue Control Laboratory, New

     Delhi, vide his report dated 20.11.2003 opined that, upon chemical analysis

     conducted by him, the samples were found to be of Buprenorphine which is a

     psychotropic substance under the
NDPS Act
. It is the case of the appellant that

     despite their best efforts, Naresh Mittal of M/s Win Drugs Ltd. could not be

     summoned and therefore, it was decided that the prosecution qua him and all

     other concerned persons would be considered as and when they would be

     available for enquiry.
11.   On 03.02.2005, the Special Court observed that Buprenorphine is a

      psychotropic substance as per the
Schedule to the NDPS Act
and its

      commercial quantity is fixed at 20 gms. The test memo as regards the present

      seizure indicated that the contents of each of the ampoules varied between 0.23

      mg to 0.34 mg. On a consideration of the above and the attendant

      circumstances, including that the respondent no. 1 did not possess any

      permission or licence for dealing in the substance and that all the respondents

      had conceded to their involvement in the crime, the Special Judge held that a

      prima facie contravention of
Section 22
along with a case of conspiracy under
Section 29
of the NDPS Act was made out. The Special Judge was also prima

      facie of the view that meticulous examination of the evidence is not required to

      be assessed at the stage of framing of charge and a mere strong suspicion of

      involvement in the crime is sufficient. Stating so, charge was directed to be

      framed. The charge was formally framed by the Special Judge on 08.02.2005.
24. Mr. Vikramjit Banerjee, the learned Additional Solicitor General appearing

     on behalf of the appellant, submitted that, in the present case, there was a

     recovery of 40,001 injections of buprenorphine, which is a psychotropic

     substance mentioned in the
Schedule to the NDPS Act
. Therefore, the

     Respondent could be said to have contravened
section 8(c)
of the NDPS Act

     which prohibits the production, manufacturing, possession, selling,
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                   Page 22 of 189
purchasing, transporting, warehousing, using, consuming, importing inter-
33. In the last, both the counsels prayed that the impugned orders of the High

      Court be set aside and the appeals be allowed.
ii.    Submissions on behalf of the Respondent(s)
34.   Mr. Yash Pal Dhingra, the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the

      respondents submitted that the drug/substance in question is covered by the
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                      Page 27 of 189
exception to
Section 8
of the NDPS Act i.e., non-applicability of the prohibition

     in case the substance is to be used for “medical or scientific purposes”.

     Furthermore, he argued that an offence under
Section 8
cannot be said to have

     been committed unless the substance also finds mention under Schedule I of

     the NDPS Rules. To fortify his contention, the learned counsel placed reliance

     on the decisions of the Delhi High Court in
Rajender Gupta & Ors. v. State
reported in 2005 SCC OnLine Del 873 and Rajesh Sharma v. Union of India

     reported in 2009 SCC OnLine Del 1330 along with the decision of this Court

     in Rajesh Kumar Gupta (supra).
37. In the last, the counsel submitted that there being no merit in the appeals, those

     may be dismissed.
49. With respect to the export of substances mentioned in Schedule III,
Article 12
states that exporters must draw up a declaration in triplicate, on a form, which

     contains information including the name and address of the exporter and

     importer, the international non-proprietary name or the designation of the

     substance in the Schedule, the quantity and the pharmaceutical form in which

     the substance is exported, the name of the preparation, if any, and the date of

     despatch. Exporters must furnish two copies of the declaration to the competent

     authorities of their country or region and attach the third copy to their

     consignment. Thereafter, the State from whose territory a Schedule III
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                    Page 38 of 189
substance has been exported, shall not later than 90 days after the date of

      despatch, send to the competent authorities of the importing country or region,

      one copy of the declaration received from the exporter by registered mail with

      return of receipt requested. The States may also require that after the

      consignment has been received, the importer shall transmit the copy of the

      declaration accompanying the consignment which has been duly endorsed

      stating the quantities received and the date of the receipt, to the competent

      authorities of the importing country or region.25. It was submitted that the respondent no. 3 and respondent nos. 1 and 2

     respectively were granted bail by the High Court vide its orders dated

     11.01.2005 and 22.08.2005 respectively. However, in doing so, the High Court

     had observed that Buprenorphine Hydrochloride is beyond the pale of Chapter

     VII of the NDPS Rules and owing to it being a Schedule H drug under the D&C

     Act and its Rules, the offence under
Section 8
of the NDPS Act would not be

     made out. Consequently, it was observed that the accused cannot be punished

     under
Sections 22
and
29
of the NDPS Act respectively. Being aggrieved by

     the aforesaid observation made by the High Court, the appellant filed a Special

     Leave Petition against both the orders granting bail to the respondents and this

     Court vide its order dated 31.03.2006 had clarified and directed that the

     observations made by the High Court shall not have any binding effect when

     the matter is finally considered before the Special Judge on merits.
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                    Page 23 of 189
31. Mr. Arvind Kumar Sharma, the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the

     appellant herein adopted the submissions canvassed by the learned ASG. In

     addition, the counsel submitted that there is nothing to indicate that Rule 64 is

     the “governing rule” under Chapter VII of the NDPS Rules and since Rule 64
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                       Page 26 of 189
pertains only to Schedule I substances, all the other rules must also necessarily

      apply to Schedule I substances. The language of Rules 66 and 67 respectively,

      is unambiguous and they clearly apply to “any psychotropic substance” which

      cannot be read to exclude the substances which only find mention in the
Schedule to the NDPS Act
. Furthermore, Rules 65 and 66 respectively, adopt

      the provisions of the D&C Rules rather than excluding it. Therefore, the

      resultant effect must be that the contravention of the D&C Rules would ipso

      facto tantamount to a violation of Rules 65 and 66 of the NDPS Rules

      respectively, thereby attracting punishment under the
NDPS Act
.
32. It was submitted that certain drugs are regulated by both the
NDPS Act
and the

      D&C Act simultaneously since they can be used as both psychotropic

      substances as well as medicinal drugs in view of their narcotic properties. This

      does not necessarily mean that an accused would be absolved of his guilt under

      the
NDPS Act
once the substance finds mention under the D&C Rules.
36. It was submitted that the decision of the Delhi High Court in Rajesh Sharma

     (supra) cannot be said to be inapplicable solely because it was rendered in the

     context of a bail application. It was submitted that while dealing with an

     application for bail under the
NDPS Act
, the Court must get over the rigour

     contained in
Section 37(1)(b)(ii)
of the NDPS Act. Therefore, only after giving

     an opportunity to the Public Prosecutor and recording a satisfaction to the effect

     that there are reasonable grounds for believing that the accused is not guilty of
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                      Page 28 of 189
such offence, a decision to grant bail is arrived at. Hence, the findings rendered

     in a bail application are also extremely relevant while deciding the question

     whether an offence under
Section 8
of the NDPS Act is made out or not.
29. Moreover, the judgment of the Full Bench has attained finality.
            The special leave petition has been dismissed. The subsequent
            Division Bench, therefore, could not have said as to whether the
            law declared by the Full Bench would have a prospective
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                    Page 106 of 189
operation or not. The law declared by a court will have a
            retrospective effect if not otherwise stated to be so specifically.
            The Full Bench having not said so, the subsequent Division Bench
            did not have the jurisdiction in that behalf.”

                                                      (Emphasis supplied)
42. The learned counsel for the parties have also briefly
              referred to
Section 6
of the General Clauses Act, 1897. It would
              be appropriate to reproduce the said provision hereunder:16.   Aggrieved by the aforesaid order dated 30.11.2006 passed by the Special

      Judge, the appellant preferred Criminal Revision Petition No. 494 of 2007. Vide

      judgment and order dated 13.07.2011, the High Court dismissed the revision

      petition. The High Court followed the rationale adopted by this Court in State
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                     Page 13 of 189
of Uttranchal v. Rajesh Kumar Gupta reported in (2007) 1 SCC 355 wherein

     it was observed that if any particular drug does not find mention in the Schedule

     I appended to the NDPS Rules, then the provisions of
Section 8
of the NDPS

     Act would have no application whatsoever. On the question of the respondents

     being discharged under
Section 216
CrPC, the High Court remarked that it

     would not be right to say that the Special Judge had discharged the respondents.

     The matter was accordingly remitted to the Metropolitan Magistrate to proceed

     in accordance with the provisions of the D&C Act. The relevant observations

     have been reproduced below:
20. On 06.07.2009, the appellant moved an application before the Special Judge

     for stay of the proceedings since the matter on this issue was sub-judice before

     this Court by way of an SLP and also that the decision of the Delhi High Court

     in
Rajender Gupta
(supra) was challenged in appeal. Since this application was

     not being heard, the appellant also preferred a petition before the High Court

     seeking stay of the further proceedings. Vide order dated 16.09.2009, the High
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                       Page 18 of 189
Court directed the Special Judge to hear and dispose of the said application in

     the first instance before proceeding with the main matter.
21. Vide order dated 17.04.2010, the Special Judge observed that the judgement

     rendered in
Rajender Gupta
(supra) was not stayed by this Court in appeal.
In

     fact, the same was even approved by this Court in Rajesh Kumar Gupta

     (supra). Therefore, the application dated 06.07.2009 made by the appellant was

     rejected. In the same breath, the Special Judge held that Buprenorphine

     Hydrochloride is a Schedule “H” drug under the D&C Act read with its Rules.

     Despite it being a psychotropic substance under the
NDPS Act
, it was not

     included in Schedule I of the NDPS Rules. That being the case, dealing in the

     said substance is not prohibited under the
NDPS Act
and the offence under
Sections 8
and
22
of the NDPS Act respectively, were not made out. However,

     it was observed that the respondent no. 1 was involved in the illegal sale of the

     said substance since no record had been maintained in that regard. In such a

     scenario, the case was remanded to the Court of the Metropolitan Magistrate,

     Delhi to deal with in accordance with law. The relevant observations of the

     Special Judge are reproduced hereinbelow:
22. Aggrieved by the aforesaid order, the appellant preferred a Criminal M.C. No.

     2335 of 2010 under
Section 482
of the CrPC before the High Court. However,

     vide impugned Judgement and Order dated 20.03.2013, the High Court

     dismissed the petition being devoid of any merit and observed as thus:
where relying on Rajinder Gupta and Rajesh Kumar Gupta, the
           learned Single Judge of this Court held that a person found in
           possession of Buprenorphine Hydrochloride will not be guilty
           under
Section 22
of the NDPS Act.
26. It was further submitted that the High Court committed an error in placing

     reliance on the decision in
State of Uttaranchal vs. Rajesh Kumar Gupta
reported in 2007 (1) SCC 355 as
the said decision
is not applicable to the facts

     of the present case. In the said case, the accused who possessed an Ayurveda

     Shashtri Degree was running a clinic while being assisted by eight other

     medical practitioners who were Allopathic and Ayurvedic doctors. A total of 7

     medicines were seized and all of them were mentioned in Schedules G & H of

     the D&C Rules and the same were said to be used for medical purposes.

     However, in the present case, the contraband found in the illegal possession of

     the respondent no. 1 was without any label. Furthermore, the respondents are

     neither registered medical practitioners nor were they able to produce any

     document, permit or license to deal with said substances or medicines.
27. It was vehemently submitted that the High Court had erred in holding that Rules

     53 and 64 of the NDPS Rules respectively, only pertain to the psychotropic

     substances mentioned in Schedule I to the NDPS Rules and since

     Buprenorphine Hydrochloride is a psychotropic substance mentioned in the
Schedule to the NDPS Act
but not in Schedule I to the NDPS Rules, the offence

     under the
NDPS Act
would not be made out. It was argued that the said

     observation was contrary to the subsequent judgement passed by this Court in
Union of India & Anr. Vs. Sanjeev V. Deshpande
reported in 2014 13 SCC 1,
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                    Page 24 of 189
wherein it has been clearly held that the prohibition under 8 of the
NDPS Act
is attracted in respect of the psychotropic substances listed in
Schedule to the

     NDPS Act
as well as Schedule I to the NDPS Rules framed under the Act. It

     was further held that the
NDPS Act
does not contemplate the framing of rules

     for prohibiting activities involving drugs and psychotropic substances for the

     reason that
Section 8(c)
of the NDPS Act already prohibits such activities.
28. As regards the issue of prospective overruling, the counsel submitted that the

     decision of this Court in Sanjeev V. Deshpande (supra) overruled the decision

     in Rajesh Kumar Gupta (supra) without a specific declaration that the same

     was prospectively overruled. In the absence of such a declaration, the

     interpretation of law in Sanjeev V. Deshpande (supra) must be held to be

     retrospectively applicable to all cases, including those which have been

     pending before different courts.
30. In the last, the learned counsel submitted that subsequent to bail being granted,

     the respondents, as a clever device, filed an application under
section 216
of

     the CrPC, seeking alteration of charges. The Special Judge, in complete

     disregard to the direction passed by this Court, allowed the application and held

     that the offence under the
NDPS Act
is not made out qua all the respondents,

     and that the case rather pertains to the D&C Act. Such an order could not be

     said to be in tune with the judgement rendered by this Court in
K. Ravi vs. State

     of Tamil Nadu & Anr.
reported in (2024) SCC OnLine SC 2283, wherein it

     was specifically held that
Section 216
of the CrPC does not entitle the accused

     to file a fresh application seeking discharge, once the charges have been framed

     by the Court. It was further stated therein that an application under
Section 216
CrPC is sometimes filed due to the ignorance of law and also with an aim to

     deliberately delay the trial proceedings. In the present case, the application filed

     under
Section 216
CrPC was absolutely misconceived and was with a sole

     intent to derail the trial proceedings.
35. The counsel vehemently submitted that the decision in Sanjeev V. Deshpande

     (supra) must strictly be held to be prospectively applicable. If not, it would

     serve to cause immense prejudice to the respondents who have already been

     discharged by the Special Judge.
40.   As per its Preamble, the NDPS Act, 1985 seeks to consolidate and amend the

      law relating to narcotic drugs, make stringent provisions for the control and

      regulation of operations relating to narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances

      and implement the provisions of the International Conventions on Narcotic

      Drugs and Psychotropic Substances, amongst others. This Court in
State of

      Rajasthan v. Udai Lal
reported in (2008) 11 SCC 408 elaborated that the
NDPS Act
is a special Act which has been enacted with a view to make

      stringent provisions for the control and regulation of operations relating to

      narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances and stated as thus:
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                       Page 30 of 189
41.   Another decision of this Court in
Hira Singh v. Union of India
reported in

      (2020) 20 SCC 272 opined that while determining the “small or commercial

      quantity” of the narcotic drug or psychotropic substance in cases of seizure of

      a mixture of narcotic drugs or psychotropic substances with one or more neutral

      substances, the quantity of the neutral substance(s) is not to be excluded and is

      to be taken into consideration along with the actual content by weight of the

      offending drug. While declaring so, the Court also discussed the object of the
NDPS Act
and highlighted that the enactment was intended to be a deterrent

      against the use of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances. The relevant

      observations are reproduced below:
47.
Article 11
elaborates on record-keeping and provides that – (a) In respect of

     substances in Schedule I, manufacturers and all other authorised persons under
Article 7
shall maintain records indicating the details of the quantity

     manufactured, the quantity held in stock and, for each acquisition and disposal,

     the details of the quantity, date, supplier and recipient; (b) In respect of

     substances in Schedules II and III respectively, manufacturers, wholesale

     distributors, exporters and importers must keep records showing details of the

     quantity manufactured and, for each acquisition and disposal, details of the
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                     Page 36 of 189
quantity, date, supplier and recipient; (c) In respect of substances mentioned in

     Schedule II, retail distributors, institutions for hospitalization and care, and

     scientific institutions must keep records showing for each acquisition and

     disposal, details of the quantity, date, supplier and recipient; (d) Information

     regarding the acquisition and disposal of substances in Schedule III by retail

     distributors, institutions for hospitalization and care, and scientific institutions

     must be made readily available through appropriate methods and by taking into

     account the professional and trade practices of the respective States; and (e) In

     respect of substances in Schedule IV, manufacturers, exporters and importers

     must keep records indicating the quantity manufactured, exported and

     imported.
64.   Under Chapter VII, Rule 64 on ‘General Prohibition’ states that no person shall

      manufacture, possess, transport, import inter-State, export inter-State, sell,

      purchase, consume or use any of the “psychotropic substances specified under

      Schedule I” of the Rules. Rule 65 relating to the ‘Manufacture of psychotropic

      substances’, under sub-rule (1), provides that, subject to the provisions of sub-

      rule (2), the manufacture of any of the psychotropic substances other than those

      specified in Schedule I (i.e., those mentioned only under the
Schedule to the

      Act
) shall be in accordance with the conditions of a licence granted under the
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                      Page 50 of 189
Drugs and Cosmetics Rules, 1945 framed under the
Drugs and Cosmetics Act,

     1940
, by an authority in charge of Drugs Control in a State appointed by the

     State Government in this behalf. Sub-rule (2) states that the authority in charge

     of drugs control in a State/the Licensing Authority shall consult the Drugs

     Controller (India) with regard to the assessed annual requirements of each of

     the psychotropic substance (which has been referred to in sub-rule (1) i.e., the

     substances mentioned only under the
Schedule to the Act
) in bulk form in the

     country and after taking into account the requirement of such psychotropic

     substances in the State, as also the quantity of such substance required for

     supply to other manufacturers outside the State and the quantity of such

     substance required for reasonable inventory to be held by a manufacturer, the

     authority in charge of drugs control in a State/the Licensing Authority shall

     specify, by order, a limit to the quantity of such substance which may be

     manufactured by the manufacturer in the State. Sub-rule (3) provides that the

     specific quantity which may be manufactured by a specific licensee in a year

     shall be intimated by the Licensing Authority to the licensee at the time of

     issuing the licence. Then, there are two provisos to Rule 65 sub-rule (3) which

     were inserted vide notification dated 25th June, 1997 w.e.f 27.06.1997. Through

     the first proviso, an exception has been carved out under the Rule by stating

     that nothing contained in this rule shall apply in case the “psychotropic

     substances specified in Schedule I” are manufactured, possessed, transported,
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                     Page 51 of 189
imported inter-State, exported inter-State, sold, purchased, consumed or used

     subject to other provisions of this Chapter which apply to psychotropic

     substances which are not included in Schedule I and for the purposes mentioned

     in Chapter VIIA. The second proviso contemplates that the authority in charge

     of drugs control in a State shall consult the Narcotics Commissioner before

     issuing a licence under Rule 65 in respect of psychotropic substances included

     in “Schedule I appended to the Rules” and Schedule III appended to the Rules

     as well.
70.   It is evident from the decision of this Court in
Hussain v. State of Kerala
reported in (2000) 8 SCC 139 that “Buprenorphine” being listed under the
Schedule to the NDPS Act
and not under Schedule I of the NDPS Rules, would

      be a psychotropic substance under the NDPS regime, to which
Section 8
of the

      NDPS Act would apply. The appellant therein was found in possession of 6

      ampoules of “Buprenorphine tidigesic” each containing 2ml. The defence that

      he put forth to justify his possession was that he was regularly using it under

      medical advice with a valid prescription. Despite such defence put forward by

      the appellant, the Trial Court convicted him under
Section 21
of the NDPS Act

      which relates to the contravention of the law in respect of “manufactured drugs

      and preparations” since the District Medical Officer had opined that

      “Buprenorphine tidigesic” is a manufactured drug. He was sentenced to
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                      Page 58 of 189
undergo rigorous imprisonment for a period of 10 years along with payment of

     fine. On appeal, the High Court affirmed the conviction and sentence. However,

     this Court opined that the prosecution had, first, failed to prove that the

     substance in question was a ‘manufactured drug’ falling within the definition

     given under
Section 2(xi)
of the NDPS Act. Instead, it was observed that

     “Buprenorphine” is a substance listed under Item 92 of the
Schedule to the Act
and is therefore, a psychotropic substance. Secondly, this Court proceeded to

     examine whether the possession of the said substance would constitute an

     offence under
Section 8
of the NDPS Act. Upon examining Rule 66 of the

     NDPS Rules, it was held that a person is permitted to keep in his possession,

     for his personal medical use, a psychotropic substance up to 100 dosage units

     at a time and the 6 ampoules possessed by the appellant therein could not be

     said to exceed the said limit of 100 dosage units. It was declared that, in such

     circumstances, the conviction and sentence imposed on the appellant was

     without the sanction of law and as a consequence, the judgment of the High

     Court as well as the Sessions Court was set aside. The relevant observations

     made by this Court are reproduced hereinbelow:
72.
In yet another decision of this Court in Ouseph alias
Thankachan v. State of

     Kerala
reported in (2004) 4 SCC 446, it was declared that “Buprenorphine” is

     a psychotropic substance and if an accused is found in possession of the same,

     his case would have to be examined through the rigours of
Sections 8
and
22
of the NDPS Act read with Rule 66 of the NDPS Rules respectively. The

     appellant therein was found to be in possession of 110 ampoules of

     Buprenorphine. He stood convicted under
Section 22
of the NDPS Act and

     was sentenced to ten years of rigorous imprisonment along with fine. The High

     Court dismissed the appeal challenging the order of conviction and sentence.

     This Court considered the alternate argument canvassed under
Section 27
of

     the NDPS Act which provides that whoever, in contravention of any provision

     of this Act, possesses any psychotropic substance, “which is proved to have

     been intended for his personal consumption and not for sale or distribution”

     shall be punishable for a term which may extend to 6 months or fine or both.

     To consider the applicability of the aforesaid provision, it had to be determined

     whether the substance was in a “small quantity” and if so, whether it was
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                     Page 62 of 189
intended for personal consumption. Answering both the questions in the

     affirmative, it was held that the offence proved to have been committed by the

     appellant would fall under
Section 27
of the Act and accordingly, the conviction

     of the appellant therein was altered. The relevant observations made by this

     Court are reproduced as thus:
73.
In Ravindran alias
John and Anr. v. Superintendent of Customs
reported in

      (2007) 6 SCC 410 the two appellants along with one another accused named

      Hiralal were convicted for the offence under
Section 8(c)
read with
Sections 22
and
29
of the NDPS Act respectively and were sentenced to undergo rigorous

      imprisonment for 10 years along with fine, in relation to the possession,

      transport and sale of diazepam (which is also a substance listed under the
Schedule to the Act
and not in Schedule I of the Rules) weighing 1.53 kgs. On

      appeal, the High Court affirmed the conviction of the appellants but acquitted

      Hiralal against whom it found no satisfactory evidence to prove the charges.

      While dismissing the appeal so far as one of the accused was concerned and

      allowing the appeal against conviction of the other, this Court observed that
Section 8
along with
Section 22(c)
of the NDPS Act would be attracted even

      while the substance in question was Diazepam which is listed as Sl. No. 43
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                     Page 65 of 189
under the
Schedule to the NDPS Act
and absent in Schedule I of the NDPS

      Rules. The relevant observations are as thus:
74.   In Rajesh Kumar Gupta (supra) this Court considered the plea of the State to

      cancel the bail granted to the accused therein. In the said case, the premises of

      the two clinics run by the respondent claiming to be a Ayurvedacharya was

      raided. In the search, 70kg of pure Phenobarbitone was recovered and seized.

      It was further found out that huge quantities of Phenobarbitone was being sold

      to the patients in both his clinics over a period of several years. Therefore, the

      respondent was charged under
Section 8
read with
Section 22
of the NDPS Act.

      While the Special Judge had refused to grant bail, the High Court allowed the

      bail application and released the accused on bail. Agreeing with the High Court,

      this Court held that prima facie the provisions of the Act were not found to be
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                       Page 66 of 189
applicable in a case wherein the psychotropic substance in question was only

     mentioned under the
Schedule to the NDPS Act
and not under Schedule I of

     the NDPS Rules.
75. While declining to interfere with the grant of bail, this Court in Rajesh Kumar

     Gupta (supra) expounded the law on several aspects:
(Emphasis supplied)

     ii. Secondly, it was held that Rules 53 and 64 of the NDPS Rules

         respectively, contain a genus and the other provisions following the

         same under the said Chapter are species thereof. Both the rules were said

         to contain a general prohibition as regard the narcotic drugs and

         psychotropic substances specified in Schedule I of the NDPS Rules.

         Therefore, the reference to “psychotropic substances” in the other rules

         following in Chapters VI and VII of the NDPS Rules respectively were

         also said to be construed as a reference to the Schedule I psychotropic

         substances under the NDPS Rules and not the larger list of substances

         mentioned in the
Schedule to the Act
itself. Hence, if the said

         psychotropic substances do not find a place in Schedule I appended to

         the NDPS Rules, the provisions of
Section 8
of the NDPS Act would
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                      Page 69 of 189
have no application whatsoever. The relevant observations are

         reproduced hereinbelow:
76.
In
Sanjay Kumar Kedia v. Narcotics Control Bureau and Another
reported in

     (2008) 2 SCC 294, this Court was faced with deciding, yet again, whether bail

     should be granted to the appellant wherein he was arrested in connection with

     the commission of offence under
Sections 24
and
29
of the NDPS Act

     respectively, for the illegal sale of drugs, more particularly “Phentermine” and

     “Butalbital”, through the internet. These two substances feature at Sl. Nos. 70

     and 93 of the
Schedule to the NDPS Act
respectively and are not found in

     Schedule I of the NDPS Rules. While agreeing with the High Court that bail

     should not be granted and also providing a disclaimer that the observations

     made by this Court must not influence the decision on trial, this Court said that

     the benefit under
Section 79
of the Information Technology Act, 2002 given to

     the intermediaries could not be extended to the appellant. In declaring so, it was

     held that the two drugs finding a place in the
Schedule to the Act
made it clear

     that they are psychotropic substances falling within the prohibition contained

     in
Section 8
thereof and stated thus:
Furthermore, it was contended that since the drugs were used for medicinal

     purposes, the same is acknowledged in terms of the proviso under
Section 8(c)
of the NDPS Act. However, this Court took the view that the fact that the

     appellant and his co-accused had obtained licences under the D&C Act with a

     general permission for import and export did not enure any particular benefit

     to them since the D&C Act does not deal with exports. The appellant and his

     co-accused being licensees were thus required to comply with the specific

     requirements of the
NDPS Act
and its Rules. Hence, an offence under
Section

     8(c)
was said to have been made out in the absence of an export authorisation

     and it was held that the application for bail was rightly rejected by the Special

     Judge as also the High Court. The relevant observations are as thus:
78. A three-Judge Bench decision of this Court in Union of India and Another v.
Sanjeev V. Deshpande reported in (2014) 13 SCC 1 related to a batch of

     matters, all pertaining to prosecutions under the provisions of the
NDPS Act
wherein each one of the accused was alleged to have been in possession of a

     psychotropic substance only mentioned under the
Schedule to the Act
. In some

     of the cases bail was granted by the concerned High Court and in few others,

     bail was denied. This Court examined the legality of the conclusion that the

     absence of mention of a particular psychotropic substance in Schedule I to the

     Rules excludes the application of
Section 8
, notwithstanding the fact that such

     a drug is included in the
Schedule to the Act
.
The relevant observations are reproduced hereinbelow:
79.   What is discernible from the aforementioned decisions is that, there is no

      shadow of doubt on the proposition that dealing in psychotropic substances not

      finding a mention in Schedule I of the NDPS Rules but finding place in the
Schedule to the Act
, would also constitute an offence under
Section 8
of the

      NDPS Act. Such was the position even before the decision of this Court in

      Sanjeev V. Deshpande (supra). The only decision of this Court that laid down

      an alternate position of law was Rajesh Kumar Gupta (supra) which now

      stands overruled. It would be preposterous to say that no offence could be said

      to be made out when an accused deals with substances which are only

      mentioned under the
Schedule to the Act
. For then, the entire presence of the
Schedule to the Act
would have to be considered unnecessary to the scheme of

      the NDPS Regime. To render an entire Schedule nugatory could not have been

      the intention of the legislature.

80.   What we understand to be the clarification of the position of law in Rajesh

      Kumar Gupta (supra) and Sanjeev V. Deshpande (supra) is thus:




88.   In Sanjeev V. Deshpande (supra), while it was deemed unnecessary to

      undertake a complete analysis of the implications of
Section 80
of the NDPS

      Act in view of the conclusion arrived at therein, yet it was observed that the

      provisions of the
NDPS Act
apply in addition to the provisions of the D&C

      Act. Furthermore, it was stated that while the D&C Act deals with various

      operations of manufacture, sale, purchase etc. of drugs generally, the
NDPS

      Act
deals with a more specific class of drugs and is therefore, a special law on

      the subject. The relevant observations are reproduced hereinbelow:
89. The object of the
NDPS Act
and D&C Act, respectively was reiterated in
State

     of Punjab v. Rakesh Kumar
reported in (2019) 2 SCC 466. Herein, several

     respondent-accused were convicted for the offence committed either under
Section 21
or
Section 22
of the NDPS Act for the bulk possession of

     “manufactured drugs” without any valid authorisation. The High Court allowed

     the applications seeking suspension of sentence, preferred by the respondent-

     accused and directed that they be released on bail pending the final disposal of

     the appeals before it. In doing so, it was observed by the High Court that in

     cases of manufactured drugs, be it containing narcotic drugs or psychotropic

     substances, if manufactured by a manufacturer, the same must be tried if a

     violation has been committed, under the D&C Act and not under the
NDPS

     Act
, except in cases where the substance is in a loose form i.e., powder, liquid

     etc. This Court disagreed with the High Court that the respondent-accused

     could only be prosecuted for an offence under the D&C Act despite there being
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                       Page 89 of 189
a prima facie violation of
Section 8
of the NDPS Act. In opining so, the decision

     elaborated on the following aspects:
accused must be tried under the
Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940
instead of the
NDPS Act
, as they were found in possession of the
              “manufactured drugs”, does not hold good in law. [...]”.

x.     Several decisions of this Court including
Hussain
(supra), Ouseph

            alias
Thankachan
(supra), Ravindran alias
John
(supra),
Sanjay

            Kumar Kedia
(supra),
D. Ramakrishnan
(supra) and Sanjeev V.

            Deshpande (supra) have held that an offence under
Section 8
of the

            NDPS Act can be made out even in respect of substances only

            mentioned under the
Schedule to the NDPS Act
and absent under

            Schedule I of the NDPS Rules.
The outlier amongst these decisions

            was Rajesh Kumar Gupta (supra) which was subsequently overruled

            in Sanjeev V. Deshpande (supra).

       with prospective effect?
a.     An overruling decision generally operates retrospectively.

93. This Court in
Sarwan Kumar and Another v. Madan Lal Aggarwal
reported

     in (2003) 4 SCC 147, opined that when this Court interprets an existing law

     while overruling the interpretation assigned to it earlier, it cannot be said that a

     new law is laid down. The declaration of law relates back to the law itself. In

     other words, it would be deemed that the law was never otherwise.
Herein, a 5-
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                      Page 101 of 189
judge bench of this Court in Gian Devi Anand v. Jeevan Kumar and Others

     reported in (1985) 2 SCC 683 had held that the rule of heritability extends to

     the statutory tenancy of a commercial premises as much as to a residential

     premises under the
Delhi Rent Control Act, 1958
.
In light of the same, the

     question for determination in
Sarwan Kumar
(supra) was whether a decree for

     ejectment which was passed by a civil court qua a commercial tenancy on the

     basis that the tenancy was not heritable, before the declaration of law in Gian

     Devi Anand (supra), was executable or not? By stating that the jurisdiction of

     the civil court to pass the decree for ejectment was barred and that the decree

     obtained by the decree-holder cannot be executed owing to it being a nullity

     and non-est, this Court observed as follows:
Invocation of the doctrine of “prospective overruling” is left to the
           discretion of the Court to mould with the justice of the cause or the
           matter before the Court. This Court while deciding Gian Devi
           Anand case [(1985) 2 SCC 683 : 1985 Supp (1) SCR 1] did not
           hold that the law declared by it would be prospective in operation.
           It was not for the High Court to say that the law laid down by this
           Court in Gian Devi Anand case [(1985) 2 SCC 683 : 1985 Supp
           (1) SCR 1] would be prospective in operation. If this is to be
           accepted then conflicting rules can supposedly be laid down by
           different High Courts regarding the applicability of the law laid
           down by this Court in Gian Devi Anand case [(1985) 2 SCC 683 :
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                    Page 102 of 189
When the court decides that the interpretation given to a particular
           provision earlier was not legal, it declares the law as it stood right
           from the beginning as per its decision. In Gian Devi case [(1980)
           17 DLT 197] the interpretation given by the Delhi High Court that
           commercial tenancies were not heritable was overruled being
           erroneous. Interpretation given by the Delhi High Court was not
           legal. The interpretation given by this Court declaring that the
           commercial tenancies heritable would be the law as it stood from
           the beginning as per the interpretation put by this Court. It would
           be deemed that the law was never otherwise. Jurisdiction of the
           civil court has not been taken away by the interpretation given
           by this Court. This Court declared that the civil court had no
           jurisdiction to pass such a decree. It was not a question of taking
           away the jurisdiction; it was the declaration of law by this Court
           to that effect. The civil court assumed the jurisdiction on the basis
           of the interpretation given by the High Court in Gian Devi
           case [(1980) 17 DLT 197] which was set aside by this Court.

94. While addressing the issue of the temporal and retrospective effect of a judicial

     decision and declaring that a tribunal or court is bound by a higher court’s

     decision on the point in issue, irrespective of whether it is declared either prior
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                     Page 103 of 189
to or subsequent to the order which is sought to be called into question by a

     party, this Court in
Assistant Commissioner, Income Tax, Rajkot v.

     Saurashtra Kutch Stick Exchange Limited
reported in (2008) 14 SCC 171

     stated that a judicial decision acts retrospectively by placing reliance on the

     Blackstonian theory. According to this theory, it is not the function of the court

     to pronounce a “new rule” but to maintain and expound the “old one”.

     Therefore, if the subsequent decision alters or overrules the earlier one, it

     cannot be said to have made a new law. The correct principle of law is just

     discovered and applied retrospectively. In other words, if in a given situation

     an earlier decision of the court operated for quite some time and it is overruled

     by a subsequent decision, the decision rendered subsequently would have

     retrospective effect and would serve to clarify the legal position which was not

     clearly understood earlier. Any transaction would then be covered by the law

     declared by the overruling decision. The overruling is generally retrospective

     with the only caveat being that matters that are res judicatae or accounts that

     have been settled in the meantime would not be disturbed. The relevant

     observations made by this Court are reproduced hereinbelow:
95. Resorting to the doctrine of “prospective overruling” is therefore, an exception

     to the normal rule that a judgement or decision applies retrospectively and to

     the general rule of doctrine of precedent. The application of the doctrine is

     based on the philosophy that “The past cannot always be erased by a new

     judicial declaration”. That the Court can contemplate giving prospective

     application to a law declared by it, stems from the premise that the Court is

     neither required to apply a decision retrospectively nor is it prohibited from

     applying it retrospectively. The merits and demerits of retrospective or
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                  Page 105 of 189
prospective application is examined and the doctrine is applied wherever

      appropriate and necessary. This is precisely why the express declaration by a

      court that its decision is prospectively applicable is a requisite condition.

      Prospectivity as a concept cannot be considered to be inhered in all situations

      since the intention to attribute prospectivity to a decision must be limpid and

      clear. The same has been reiterated in a catena of decisions by this Court.
96.   That there is no prospective overruling unless it is so indicated expressly and

      in the clearest possible terms was
laid down by
this Court in
P.V. George and

      Others v. State of Kerala and Others
reported in (2007) 3 SCC 557.
“19. It may be true that when the doctrine of stare decisis is not
            adhered to, a change in the law may adversely affect the interest
            of the citizens. The doctrine of prospective overruling although is
            applied to overcome such a situation, but then it must be stated
            expressly. The power must be exercised in the clearest possible
            term. The decisions of this Court are clear pointer thereto.

97.   In another decision of this Court in B.A. Linga Reddy and Others v.
Karnataka State Transport Authority and Others reported in (2015) 4 SCC

      515, it was reiterated that in the absence of a declaration that the decision would

      operate prospectively, it must be given retrospective effect. The relevant

      observations are as thus:
98.
In yet another decision of this Court in
Manoj Parihar and Others v. State of

     Jammu and Kashmir and Others
reported in (2022) 14 SCC 72, where the

     bench comprised of one of us (J.B. Pardiwala, J.), it was opined that the doctrine

     of prospective overruling must be exercised in explicit terms and therefore, the

     law declared by this Court would have a retrospective effect unless stated

     otherwise. The observations are reproduced as thus:
99. Prospective Overruling which was initially a doctrine familiar to American

     Jurisprudence was applied by this Court for the first time in
C. Golak Nath and

     Others v. State of Punjab and Another
reported in AIR 1967 SC 1643. By

     setting out certain limits for the application of this doctrine, it was laid down

     that the doctrine of prospective overruling can be invoked only in matters

     arising under the Constitution; that it could be applied only by this Court since

     it has the constitutional jurisdiction to declare the law binding on all courts in

     the country; and that the scope of the retroactive operation of the law which has

     been declared in supersession of its earlier decision(s) would be left to the

     Court’s discretion to be moulded in accordance with the justice of the cause or

     matter before it. Over the period of time, this doctrine has been extended to the

     interpretation of ordinary statutes as well. Furthermore, the doctrine has also

     been applied in situations wherein the Court has dealt with the issue or the

     question of law for the first time. Therefore, it can be said that case-law

     trajectory has seen both the prospective declaration and the prospective

     overruling of law.

100. This Court in
Baburam v. C.C.Jacob and Others
reported in (1999) 3 SCC

     362 elaborated on the reasons which necessitate the prospective declaration of
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                     Page 109 of 189
law by this Court, by stating that the object would be to avoid the reopening of

     settled issues, to prevent the multiplicity of proceedings, to curb uncertainty in

     law and thwart avoidable litigation. It was stated that, on the application of this

     doctrine, it is deemed that all actions taken contrary to the declaration of law

     but prior to the date of the declaration, are validated. The subordinate forums

     which are legally bound to apply the declaration of law made by this Court are

     also required to apply such a dictum to cases which would arise in future only.

     The pertinent observations made in the decision are reproduced hereinbelow:
101. However, partly differing from the interpretation given in
Baburam
(supra),

     the Constitutional Bench of this Court in
Somaiya Organics (India) Ltd. and

     Another v. State of U.P. and Another
reported in (2001) 5 SCC 519 had

     clarified that the application of the doctrine of prospective overruling would

     not have the effect of validating an invalid law.
Therein, initially, a seven-judge

     bench of this Court in
Synthetics and Chemicals Ltd. and Others v. State of

     U.P. and Others
reported in (1990) 1 SCC 109, held that the provisions of State

     enactments permitting the levy of excise duty in the form of vend fee must be

     struck down prospectively from the date of its judgment i.e., from 25.10.1989.

     There was, however, some confusion on whether the State was entitled to

     collect the taxes in respect of the period prior to 25.10.1989 or not. As per the

     majority, prospective overruling, despite the terminology is only a recognition

     of the principle that the court moulds the relief claimed in order to meet the
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                     Page 111 of 189
justice of the case, more particularly justice not in its logical but in its equitable

     sense. Prospective overruling could be seen as a method which was evolved by

     the courts to adjust the competing rights of the parties so as to save transactions,

     whether statutory or otherwise, that were effected by the earlier law. Therefore,

     it was held that it would not be right to say that upon applying the doctrine of

     prospective overruling, an invalid law has been held to be valid during the past

     period. All that is done is that the declaration of invalidity of the legislation is

     directed to take effect from a future date. In the facts of the case, it was

     elaborated that what was intended was that the status quo as on 25.10.1989 be

     maintained as regards the actual payment or levy concerned. Hence, what had

     gone into the coffers of the Government with or without any strings attached,

     was to remain with it and what was not received was also not to be later realised

     by the Government. The relevant observations are reproduced hereinbelow:
Ultimately, it is a question of this Court's discretion and is, for this
           reason, relatable directly to the words of the Court granting the
           relief.
xxx            xxx           xxx
33. [...] These observations are in consonance with the directions
           given in para 89 of the judgment in second
Synthetics
case [(1990)
           1 SCC 109] and applying the said principles to the present appeals
           the only conclusion which can be arrived at is that this Court
           intended the status quo as on 25-10-1989 to be maintained as
           regards actual payment or levy was concerned. What had gone to
           the coffers of the Government with or without any strings attached,
           was to remain with it and what was not received could not be
           realised by the Government.

36. It is true that the effect of a legislation without legislative
           competence is that it is non est. (See

Strictly speaking, this would have entitled the appellant to a refund
           from the respondents of all amounts collected by way of vend fee.
           But because, as stated in Synthetics [(1990) 1 SCC 109] decision
           itself, over a period of time imposts and levies had been imposed
           by virtue of the earlier decision and that the States as well as the
           petitioners and manufacturers had adjusted their rights and their
           positions on that basis, this relief was denied. The Court did not,
           by denying the relief, authorise or validate what had been
           declared to be illegal or void nor did it imbue the legislature with
           competence up to the date of the judgment.”

                                                   (Emphasis supplied)
103. Therefore, the court does not make legal, something that is illegal, for the past

     period by invoking the doctrine of prospective overruling. On the contrary,

     upon giving due consideration to what has been expounded in
Somaiya

     Organics
(supra), it is clear that the idea behind the invocation of the doctrine

     is to meet the justice of each case in the most practical and equitable sense. In
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                    Page 115 of 189
addition to this, the doctrine also seeks to adjust and balance the competing

     rights of all the parties involved i.e., parties who on one hand, had acted solely

     on the basis of an invalid law or an overruled decision and altered their

     respective rights and positions, and on the other, the parties who had brought a

     successful case in establishing that the law or decision which existed in

     operation was invalid. To prevent the chaotic unscrambling of actions done in

     the past, a middle-ground is reached by postponing the decision declaring the

     invalidity to a particular date while keeping in mind the larger interest of doing

     complete justice. That ensuring “complete justice” in the most equitable way is

     the true essence of the doctrine is also evident from the fact that this Court also

     has, on several occasions, prescribed the limits of retroactivity of the law

     declared by it.

104. Such a demarcation of the limits of retroactivity was done in
Kailash Chand

     Sharma v. State of Rajasthan and Others
reported in (2002) 6 SCC 562,

     wherein the issue was as regards the grant of bonus marks in the recruitment

     process for Primary School Teachers in Zila Parishads solely to applicants

     belonging to the district and rural areas of certain specified districts and,

     whether the same would be violative of
Articles 14
and
16
of the Constitution

     respectively.
By relying on the Full Bench decision of the High Court dated

     21.10.1999 rendered in
Deepak Kumar Suthar v. State of Rajasthan
reported
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                     Page 116 of 189
in (1999) 2 Raj LR 692 (FB), the impugned Full Bench decision dated

     18.11.1999 and another impugned Division Bench decision of the High Court

     reiterated that, providing any form of advantage or weightage in public

     employment in any State service, would not be permissible on the ground of

     place of birth or residence or, on the ground of being a resident of an urban area

     or rural area. This Court while agreeing with the impugned decisions had

     observed that the legality of the selection process which included the addition

     of bonus marks could not have been seriously doubted either by the appointing

     authorities or by the candidates, in view of the judicial precedents which

     operated at the relevant time. A cloud of doubt was cast on the said practice

     only at a time when the selection process was completed and the results were

     declared or about to be declared. Therefore, under such circumstances, it was

     considered proper to apply the impugned judgment dated 18.11.1999 rendered

     by the Full Bench of the High Court prospectively. Such a recourse was also

     considered appropriate considering that none of the appointed or selected

     candidates were made parties to the respective writ petitions before the High

     Court. Therefore, this Court thought fit to not implement the Full Bench

     decision of the High Court, which treaded a new path, to the detriment of the

     candidates who were already appointed. With a view to balance the competing

     claims, the relief was confined only to the petitioners who were affected by the

     grant of bonus marks and who had moved the High Court on or before
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                     Page 117 of 189
17.11.1999. Therefore, the appointments made on or after 18.11.1999 was

     subject to the claims of the writ petitioners i.e., if upon a fresh consideration of

     the candidature of the writ petitioners as against those candidates who were

     appointed on or after 18.11.1999, the writ petitioners were found to have had

     superior merit, they would be offered appointments even by displacing the

     candidates appointed on or after 18.11.1999, if necessary. In other words, only

     for the petitioners who had moved the High Court prior to 18.11.1999,

     retrospective benefit of the Full Bench decision was given. Otherwise, the

     appointments made up to 17.11.1999 were not to be reopened or reconsidered.

     However, the aforesaid relief was tailored with a clear disclaimer that it was

     moulded in view of the special facts and circumstances of the case and while

     acting within the jurisdiction conferred upon this Court under
Article 142
of

     the Constitution. The relevant observations are reproduced hereinbelow:
107. While holding so, it was stated that courts can make the law
laid down by
them

     prospective in operation to prevent the unsettlement of settled positions, to

     prevent administrative chaos and to meet the ends of justice. The law on the

     subject being in a state of flux was also a factor that was emphasized to a large

     extent.
In
B. Karunakar
(supra), the authorities all over the country had

     proceeded on the basis that there was no need to furnish a copy of the report of
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                    Page 121 of 189
the enquiry officer to the delinquent employee and innumerable employees

     were also punished as a result of those proceedings. There were some cases

     wherein the orders of punishment had become final and in some others, the

     matters were pending in courts at different stages. Reopening all those

     disciplinary proceedings would have resulted in grave prejudice to the

     administration which was considered as far outweighing the benefit which

     would potentially accrue to the employees concerned if the disciplinary

     proceedings were allowed to be disturbed.
Therefore, on a holistic perspective

     and giving due regard to both administrative reality and public interest, it was

     considered necessary that the prospectivity given to the decision in
Mohd.

     Ramzan Khan
(supra) not be disturbed. The relevant observations of the

     majority opinion are reproduced hereinbelow:
Ramzan Khan
case [(1991) 1 SCC 588 : 1991 SCC (L&S) 612 :
108. The minority opinion rendered by K. Ramaswamy, J., also illustrated the

     circumstances and the potential reasons due to which the doctrine of

     prospective overruling may be resorted to. It was opined that under

     constitutional law, retrospective operation of an overruling judgment is neither

     required nor prohibited. The decision as regards retrospectivity or prospectivity

     must depend on the facts and circumstances of each case, as also the nature and

     purpose which the overruling decision seeks to serve. Other relevant factors

     which must be taken account of include the justifiable reliance which has been

     placed by the administration on the overruled decision, the ability to effectuate

     the new rule adopted in the overruling case without doing injustice and whether

     the likelihood of its retrospective operation substantially burdens the

     administration of justice. Prior history of the rule in question, its purpose and

     effect and whether the retroactive operation will accelerate or retard its

     operation are also significant considerations. The relevant observations are

     reproduced as thus:
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                    Page 124 of 189
ability to effectuate the new rule adopted in the overruling case
           without doing injustice; the likelihood of its operation whether
           substantially burdens the administration of justice or retards the
           purpose. All these factors are to be taken into account while
           overruling the earlier decision or laying down a new principle.
           The benefit of the decision must be given to the parties before the
           Court even though applied to future cases from that date
           prospectively would not be extended to the parties whose
           adjudication either had become final or matters are pending trial
           or in appeal. [...] This Court would adopt retroactive or non-
           retroactive effect of a decision not as a matter of constitutional
           compulsion but a matter of judicial policy determined in each case
           after evaluating the merits and demerits of the particular case by
           looking to the prior history of the rule in question, its purpose and
           effect and whether retroactive operation will accelerate or retard
           its operation. The reliance on the old rule and the cost of the
           burden of the administration are equally germane and be taken
           into account in deciding to give effect to prospective or
           retrospective operation.”

109. Following the spirit of the discussion in
B. Karunakar
(supra), this Court has

     invoked the doctrine of prospective overruling only when it has been

     appropriate and absolutely necessary to do so. In
K. Madhava Reddy and

     Others v. State of Andhra Pradesh and Others
reported in (2014) 6 SCC 537,

     it was observed that the doctrine of prospective overruling was a rule of judicial

     craftsmanship laced with pragmatism and judicial statesmanship which intends

     to serve as an useful tool, ensuring the smooth transition of the operation of

     law, without unduly affecting the rights of the people who acted upon the law

     which existed or operated previously. In the facts of the case, it was observed

     that the reversion of the petitioner to their parent cadre was bound to have a

     cascading effect which would prejudice several persons who are not even

     parties before the Court. The relevant observations are as follows:
110. On the other hand, in
Justice Chandrashekaraiah (Retired) v. Janekere C.

     Krishna and Others
reported in (2013) 3 SCC 117 while holding that the

     appointment of the Upa-Lokayukta made in the absence of any consultation

     with the Chief Justice was void ab-initio, the Court refused to apply the

     principle of prospective overruling to save the appointment in question. It was

     stated that there was no overwhelming reason to save the appointment from

     attack and the defence that such were the appointments made in the past would

     be of no avail since merely because a wrong had been committed several times

     in the past, would not mean that it must be allowed to persist, otherwise the

     wrong would never be corrected. The relevant observations of this Court are

     reproduced hereinbelow:
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                    Page 127 of 189
111. Yet another decision of this Court in
Union of India v. I.P. Awasthi and Others
reported in (2015) 17 SCC 340 took the view that it would not be appropriate

     to apply the doctrine of prospective overruling when a large number of parties

     are not affected. The doctrine was stated to have been evolved to avoid

     confusion in matters where a large number of parties have settled their affairs

     on account of the overruled law. Since larger public interest was not involved

     in the facts of the case, this Court refrained from applying the said doctrine and

     struck down the amended rule retrospectively. The relevant observations are

     reproduced as thus:
Second, the doctrine of prospective overruling pertains only to the
           powers of this Court. As far as CAT is concerned, we doubt that
           there is any such doctrine available for exercise of its powers. For
           both reasons, we decline the suggestion made.”

                                                   (Emphasis supplied)
112.
In
Union of India and Another v. Ganpati Dealcom Private Limited
reported

     in (2023) 1 SCC 315, it was succinctly explained that the application of the

     doctrine is only a limited exception and must be resorted to when substantial

     actions have been undertaken under the invalid laws such that going back to the

     original position would be next to impossible and observed as thus:
113. Therefore, it is clear as a noon day that the invocation of the doctrine of

     prospective overruling or the attribution of prospectivity to a decision must not

     be resorted to in a routine manner without the Court satisfying itself that the

     circumstances demand such a solution, both to do complete justice to the matter

     at hand and also to reorient the law in the right direction without creating

     widespread chaos and disruption. By employing the doctrine of prospective

     overruling, the matter pending before different forums would still be governed

     under the old law or the overruled decision. In simpler words, the pending cases

     would not be affected by the new declaration of law. In the absence of this the

     Court applying this doctrine, all pending matters and future cases would

     automatically and inescapably be governed by the law declared in the

     overruling decision. In certain situations, it might be preferable on a holistic

     consideration of several competing interests and factors to invoke the doctrine

     of prospective overruling and therefore, it could be said that the ambit of the

     doctrine is co-extensive with the equity of a situation to prevent the intrusion

     into matters which have already been settled or have attained finality. The

     principle involves giving effect to the new law laid down from a prospective

d.    It would be open for another bench to subsequently decide on the
      application of the doctrine of prospective overruling to a past decision.
115.
In
Saurabh Chaudri (Dr.) and Others v. Union of India and Others
reported

     (2004) 5 SCC 618, a constitutional Bench of this Court decided on the issue of

     the temporal operation of a judgment already declared.
Here, several

     applications were filed seeking clarifications and directions for implementing

     the judgment of a Coordinate Bench of this Court in
Saurabh Chaudri v. Union

     of India
reported in (2003) 11 SCC 146 which concluded that for post-graduate

     (PG) admission to medical colleges, the all-India quota must be increased from

     25% to 50%. The aforesaid decision was rendered on 04.11.2003 but was silent

     both on whether it would be applicable to the process of admissions which had

     already commenced or if it would have prospective application.
In a majority

     opinion, it was declared that the judgement of the Coordinate Bench in
Saurabh
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                   Page 131 of 189
Chaudri
(supra) delivered on 04.11.2003 would be implemented prospectively

     from the academic year 2005-06 since the entire admission procedure for the

     academic year 2004-05 was already planned on the basis of the 25% all-India

     quota. However, S.B. Sinha, J in his minority opinion was of the view that the

     decision must be implemented from the academic year 2004-05 itself since the

     examinations were conducted much after the rendition of the judgment on

     04.11.2003 and any action taken contrary to the decision thereto must be

     considered to be taken by the appropriate authorities at their own peril. The

     relevant observations made by this Court, in its majority opinion, is as follows:
It was not an occasion where an altogether different bench was tasked with

     deciding on the prospective applicability of a previous decision rendered by a

     completely different bench. This question was, however, directly in issue

     before a three-judge bench of this Court in
Jarnail Singh and Others v.

     Lachhmi Narain Gupta and Others
reported in (2022) 10 SCC 595.
Herein,

     one of the issues was whether the judgment in
M. Nagaraj v. Union of India
reported in (2006) 8 SCC 212 could be said to operate prospectively.
M.

     Nagaraj
(supra) upheld the constitutional validity of
Article 16(4-A)
subject to

     the State collecting quantifiable data showing inadequate representation. The

     law laid down therein applied from 17.06.1995 i.e., the date on which
Article

     16(4-A)
came into force.
While agreeing with the contention that the decision

     in
M. Nagaraj
(supra) must be given prospective effect from the date of its

     decision on 19.10.2006, the Court referred to the US Supreme Court decision

     in Victor Linkletter v. Victor G. Walker reported in 1965 SCC OnLine US SC

     126 where an earlier judgement of the US Supreme Court in Mapp v. Ohio

     reported in 367 U.S. 643 was declared to be prospective in operation after

     considering the consequences that will ensue with its retrospective operation.

     With a view to avoid any confusion, and also to prevent the debilitating effect

     that it would have had on a very large number of employees, the Court declared

     that a prior judgment of this Court can be made prospectively applicable by a
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                   Page 135 of 189
different or even a smaller bench of this Court subsequently, in exercise of the

     power to do complete justice under
Article 142.
Furthermore, it was held that

     it would not be an absolute rule that prospective overruling or the prospective

     operation of a decision must be declared only by the bench which has rendered

     the decision in question.
The contrary view taken by this Court in
M.A. Murthy

     v. State of Karnataka
reported in (2003) 7 SCC 517 that there shall be no

     prospective overruling unless indicated in the “particular decision” was

     declared to be obiter and not binding.
Therefore, the three-judge bench in
Jarnail Singh
(supra) declared the decision of the five-judge Constitution

     Bench in
M. Nagaraj
(supra) to have prospective operation. The relevant

     observations are as thus:
119. In State of Kerala and Others v. Alassery Mohammed and Others reported in

     (1978) 2 SCC 386, the issue pertained to whether non-compliance with the

     requirement of Rule 22 of the Prevention of Food Adulteration Rules, 1955

     would vitiate the entire trial and the conviction recorded therein.
While this

     Court’s decision in
Rajal Das Guru Namal Pamanani v. State of Maharashtra
reported in (1975) 3 SCC 375 held that the quantities mentioned under the said

     rule are required for a correct analysis and any shortage in the said quantity is
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                         Page 137 of 189
not permitted by the Statute, however, Alassery (supra) held that if the quantity

     sent to the Public Analyst, even though less than prescribed, is sufficient and

     enables the Public Analyst to make a correct analysis, then merely because the

     quantity sent was not in strict compliance with the Rule will not result in the

     nullification of the report and obliterate its evidentiary value. This was held by

     keeping in mind that it would endanger public health to acquit offenders on

     technical grounds which have no substance.
However since
Pamanani
(supra)

     had held the field for a significant time and several prosecutions had resulted

     in acquittals in the meantime, the Court found it fit to dispose of the appeals by

     only laying down the correct proposition of law. Neither were the acquittals of

     any of the respondents set aside nor were their cases sent back to the Courts

     below. The relevant observations are reproduced hereinbelow:
Decision in many of them became final and only a few could be
           brought to this Court. Each one of the Food Inspectors concerned
           had failed in discharging his duty strictly in accordance with the
           requirements of the law, and, in such a situation, after great
           harassment, long delay, and expenses which the respondents had
           to incur, they should not be punished by this Court.
18. In the three Kerala cases Mr S.V. Gupte appearing with Mr
           K.R. Nambiar and Mr Sudhakaran stated before us that the State
           was interested more in the correct enunciation of the law than in
           seeing that the respondents in these appeals are convicted. They
           were not anxious to prosecute these matters to obtain ultimate
           conviction of the respondents. A large number of the other appeals
           are by the Municipal Corporation of Delhi for whom the Attorney
           General appeared assisted by Mr B.P. Maheshwari. Although a
           categorical stand was not taken on behalf of the appellants in these
           appeals as the one taken in the Kerala cases, eventually, the
           learned Attorney General did not seriously object to the course
           indicated by us. In the few Bombay appeals M/s V.S. Desai and
           M.N. Shroff showed their anxiety for obtaining ultimate
           convictions of the offenders, but we do not find sufficient reason
           for passing a different kind of order in the Bombay appeals.
In
           similar situations in the case of
State of Bihar v. Hiralal
           Kejriwal
[AIR 1960 SC 47 : (1960) 1 SCR 726 : 1960 Cri LJ 150]
           this Court refused to exercise its discretionary jurisdiction under
Article 136
of the Constitution and did not order the continuance
           of the criminal proceeding any further.
In
Food Inspector, Calicut
           Corporation v. Cherukattil Gopalan
[(1971) 2 SCC 322 : 1971
           SCC (Cri) 522 : 1971 Supp SCR 721] this Court said at p. 730 :
120. In Alassery (supra), there was no mention of the doctrine of prospective

     overruling being applied to the facts of the case. What was done was that the
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                   Page 139 of 189
Court refrained from setting aside the acquittals of any of the respondents

     therein or sending their cases back for re-trial to the appropriate court or

     convicting any of the respondents therein by an order of the Court itself.

     However, there was no mention as regards matters which may have been

     pending before a trial court and which required a consideration of this issue.
This may have been so because Rule 22-B which was introduced three years

     after the decision in
Pamanani
(supra) clarified the position of law
laid down

     in
Pamanani
(supra) by stating that “Notwithstanding anything contained in

     Rule 22, the quantity of sample sent for analysis shall be considered as

     sufficient unless the public analyst or the Director reports to the contrary”.

     Therefore, it was more likely that all the pending matters came to be instituted

     only after Rule 22-B was introduced and there remained no doubt on the

     position of law since. Therefore, this Court confined itself to making an

     observation relating to the acquittals alone i.e., that the acquittals would not be

     interfered with.
However, if in case, there existed a matter, instituted before the

     trial court, before Rule 22-B came into being and was concerned with the same

     question, the decision in Alassery (supra) could be said to have been applicable

     to it retrospectively.
121. The applicability or discussion relating to the doctrine of prospective overruling

     can be noticed in a few other matters under the criminal arena, though
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                     Page 140 of 189
prominently on matters pertaining to procedural law.
In
Ramesh Kumar Soni

     v. State of Madhya Pradesh
reported in (2013) 14 SCC 696, the Court was

     concerned with an amendment changing the triability of certain offences i.e.,

     from the Judicial Magistrate First Class to the Court of Session and its effect

     on the cases pending trial or pending investigation. This Court had held that

     any amendment shifting the forum of the trial had to be, on principle,

     retrospective in nature in the absence of any indication to the contrary in the

     Amendment Act. This retrospective operation of amendments relating to

     procedure would be subject to the exception that the earlier procedure which

     was correctly adopted and which led to the proceedings being concluded under

     the old law cannot be reopened for the purpose of applying the new procedure.

     Furthermore, it was also reiterated that an accused does not possess a “vested

     right of forum” for his trial. However, the decision of a Full Bench of the

     Madhya Pradesh High Court in Amendment of First Schedule of
Criminal

     Procedure Code
by Criminal Procedure Code (M.P. Amendment) Act, 2007,

     In re, reported in (2008) SCC OnLine MP 185 had opined that all the cases

     which were pending before the Judicial Magistrate as on 22.02.2008 i.e., the

     date of the amendment, would remain unaffected by the Amendment.

     Therefore, the Full Bench of the High Court directed that all the cases which

     were pending before the Judicial Magistrate and had already been committed

     to the Court of Session due to the coming into force of the amendment, to be
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                  Page 141 of 189
sent back to the Judicial Magistrate.
This Court in
Ramesh Kumar Soni
(supra)

     disagreed and overruled the decision of the Full Bench but only prospectively.

     This was done because the trial of the cases that were sent back from the

     Sessions Court to the Judicial Magistrate under the orders of the Full Bench

     may have also been concluded or may be at an advanced stage. Therefore, any

     change of forum at that stage would have caused unnecessary and avoidable

     hardship to the accused if they were transferred again to the Court of Sessions

     in light of the conclusion that an amendment to procedural law would operate

     retrospectively. The relevant observations are reproduced hereinbelow:
122. On a conspectus of the aforesaid discussion on the doctrine of prospective

     overruling, the following can be summarised:
ix.   One another decision on the doctrine of prospective overruling which

         pertains to criminal law was rendered in
Ramesh Kumar Soni
(supra).
Herein, this Court overruled the decision of the Full Bench of the High

         Court prospectively, by stating that any change of forum at this stage

         would cause unnecessary and avoidable hardship to the accused if they

         were transferred again in light of the conclusion arrived at in
Ramesh

         Kumar Soni
(supra).
123. In light of the elaborate discussion hereinabove, we do not find it necessary, in

     the facts and circumstances of the matter at hand, to exercise the powers

     available to us and declare the decision given in Sanjeev V. Deshpande (supra)

     to be prospectively applicable. We have decided so because there exists no

     overwhelming reason for us to apply the doctrine of prospective overruling. On
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                    Page 148 of 189
the other hand, in order to meet the ends of justice and with a view to ensure

     that public interest is safeguarded and to give effect to the salutary object

     behind the enactment of the
NDPS Act
, the decision must necessarily be

     retrospectively applicable. This Court in Sanjeev V. Deshpande (supra),

     perhaps, did not think fit to confine or restrict its interpretation of
Section 8
of

     the NDPS Act to future cases only.
This is evinced from the fact that whilst

     overruling Rajesh Kumar Gupta (supra), it deliberately chose not to discuss

     the doctrine of prospective overruling let alone resort to it. This conspicuous

     silence in
Sanjeev Deshpande
(supra) as regards the prospective or

     retrospective effect of overruling Rajesh Kumar Gupta (supra) has to be borne

     in mind and given due deference. As a natural corollary to the aforesaid, we see

     no reason why we should deviate from the default rule of retrospectivity and

     instead, resort to the doctrine of prospective overruling.
Therefore, pending

     cases, if any, which were instituted before the decision of this Court in Sanjeev

     V. Deshpande (supra) would also be governed by the law as clarified by it.



f.
Article 20(1)
considerations on the retrospective applicability of the
     decision in Sanjeev V. Deshpande (supra).
126. A reflection of this proposition laid down by Salmond was evident in the

     decision of the Indiana Supreme Court, way back in the year 1898, in Center

     School Township v. State reported in 150 Ind. 168., which discussed the effect

     of the overruling of a decision. It was held that a decision of a court of last

     resort, is only an exposition of what the court “construes the law to be”,

     therefore, while overruling a former decision, the court does not declare the

     overruled decision to be bad in law, but that it was “never the law”. The

     overruling would be indicative of the fact that the court was simply mistaken

     in regard to the law in its former decision and it would have the effect of

     obliterating the former decision altogether. However, it was cautioned that
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                    Page 151 of 189
courts will not apply a change made by the overruling decision to the

     construction of the law given in the overruled decision, so as to invade the

     vested rights of any person. The relevant observations are reproduced

     hereinbelow:
127. The aforementioned decision reiterates that any decision of a court would only

     be an evidence or an exposition of what the court construes the law to be and

     this is precisely why the overruling decision would remove any authoritative

     value that the overruled decision might have had, even during the intervening

     period. Center School Township (supra) also clarified that the vested right, if

     any, which is sought to be protected as an exception to the retrospective

     application of the overruling decision, must be real. They must be rights of

     property or those founded on contracts, express or implied. For example, say a

     right has arisen on a contract or a transaction in the nature of a contract which

     is authorised by a statute and the statute concerned, is repealed. In such a

     scenario, a vested right would exist independently of the repealed statute. It was

     also held that the vested right must be something more than a mere expectation

     based upon an anticipated continuance of the existing law.
129. A constitutional Bench of this Court in
Rao Shiv Bahadur Singh and Another

     v. State of Vindhya Pradesh
reported in (1953) 2 SCC 111 was concerned with

     the invocation of
Article 20(1)
with respect to a pre-Constitution ex-post facto

     law and held that
Article 20(1)
prohibits all convictions or subjections to

     penalty, after the Constitution, in respect of ex-post facto laws, irrespective of

     whether the same was a post-Constitution or a pre-Constitution law. Herein, the

     Vindhya Pradesh Ordinance 48 of 1949, though enacted on 11.09.1949, i.e.,

     after the alleged offences in the case therein were committed, was made

     retrospective and deemed to have been in force from 09.08.1948. It was
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                     Page 154 of 189
therefore, urged that the Ordinance was a “law in force” during the time the

     offences were committed and would not be hit by
Article 20.
However, this

     Court disagreed with such a contention and said that to accept such an argument

     would be to give a hyper-technical meaning to the words “law in force”. If it

     were accepted then the very purpose of
Article 20
would be defeated since any

     ex-post facto law could be given retrospective effect by the legislature to

     overcome the rigours of
Article 20.
It was this Court’s opinion that “law in

     force” must be understood as being the law in fact in existence and in operation

     at the time of commission of the offence as distinct from the law “deemed” to

     have become operative by virtue of the power of the legislature to pass

     retrospective laws. The relevant observations are reproduced hereinbelow:
130. On the other hand, the issue in question before this Court in
Soni Devrajbhai

     Babubhai v. State of Gujarat
reported in (1991) 4 SCC 298 related to the

     insertion of Section 304-B to the
IPC
, 1860 w.e.f. 19.11.1986 which created a

     new substantive offence more stringent than
Section 498-A
IPC. The incident

     in question in the case occurred prior to 19.11.1986 and therefore, the accused

     were tried under Section 498-A instead of Section 304-B since their trial under

     the latter provision would be hit by
Article 20(1).
While affirming the view

     taken by the High Court, it was elaborated that, it was Section 498-A which

     was in the statute book when the incident occurred. The offence punishable

     under Section 304-B, known as dowry death, was inserted into the statute books

     only after the offence had been committed. Another indication that a new

     offence was “created” was that
Section 304-B
IPC is punishable with a

     minimum sentence of seven years which may extend to life imprisonment and

     was triable by a Court of Session whereas
Section 498-A
IPC is triable by a

     Magistrate of the First Class and is punishable for a term which may extend to

     three years in addition to a fine. The relevant observations are reproduced

     below:
131. Another Constitutional Bench of this Court in
Central Bureau of Investigation

     v. R.R. Kishore
reported in (2023) 15 SCC 339 was faced with the issue

     whether the declaration of
Section 6-A
of the DSPE Act, 1946 as

     unconstitutional by the judgment rendered in
Subramanian Swamy v.

     Director, Central Bureau of Investigation and Another
reported in (2014) 8

     SCC 682 led to the creation of a new offence, which had the effect of causing

     implications on the fundamental right guaranteed under
Article 20(1)
of the

     Constitution, and also whether the declaration of unconstitutionality must be

     given prospective effect. This Court held that the declaration of Section 6-A as

     unconstitutional would not have any implications as far as fundamental rights

     are concerned since the provision purely related to a procedural aspect.

     Furthermore, since the declaration of a provision as unconstitutional goes to the

     root of it and makes it void ab initio and non-est, it’s effect would be

     retrospective in nature. In declaring so, the Bench elaborated on the following

     aspects:
The relevant observations are reproduced hereinbelow:
in Phillips v. Eyre [Phillips v. Eyre, (1870) LR 6 QB 1 at pp. 23
              and 25] and of the United States Supreme Court
              in Calder v. Bull [Calder v. Bull, 1 L Ed 648 at p. 649 : 3 Dall
              386 : 3 US 386 (1798)] , to hold that it would be highly unjust,
              unfair and in violation of human rights to punish a person under
              the ex post facto law for acts or omissions that were not an
              offence when committed. [...]
39.
Rao Shiv Bahadur Singh [Rao Shiv Bahadur Singh v. State
              of Vindhya Pradesh
, (1953) 2 SCC 111 : 1953 SCR 1188]
              observes that the language of clause (1) of
Article 20
of the
              Constitution is much wider in terms as the prohibition under the
              article is not confined to the passing of validity of the law, and
              that fullest effect must be given to the actual words used and
              what they convey. Accordingly, the decision had struck down
              Vidhya Pradesh Ordinance 48 of 1949, which though enacted
              on 11-9-1949, had postulated that the provisions would deemed
              to have come into force in Vidhya Pradesh on 9-4-1948, a date
              prior to the date of commission of offences. Interpreting the
              term “law in force”, it was held that the Ordinance giving
              retrospective effect would not fall within the meaning of the
              phrase “law in force” as used in clause (1) of
Article 20
of the
              Constitution. The “law in force” must be taken to relate not to
              a law deemed to be in force, but factually in force, and then only
              it will fall within the meaning of “existing law”. Artifice or
              fiction will fall foul, when they are with the intent to defeat the
              salutary object and purpose behind clause (1) of
Article 20
of
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                     Page 161 of 189
the Constitution. [In the present case, we need not examine
              when an offence is a continuous offence, an aspect and matter
              of considerable debate.]

                             xxx            xxx          xxx
132. The background and context under which we are examining the applicability

     of
Article 20(1)
to the facts of our case are quite different and distinguishable.

     We are not concerned with a situation where the legislature or another

     competent authority had once enacted a provision/rule wherein the dealing of

     substances only mentioned in Schedule I of the NDPS Rules, would constitute

     an offence and the same later came to be substituted with a provision/rule which

     stated that the dealing in of all substances mentioned under the
Schedule to the

     Act
would also constitute an offence under
Section 8
. It is just that the position

     of law was assumed to be so in Rajesh Kumar Gupta (supra), however, that

     conclusion was expressly declared as wrong in
Sanjeev V Deshpande
(supra).
The three-judge Bench in
Sanjeev V Deshpande
(supra) while overruling

     Rajesh Kumar Gupta (supra) went to the extent of saying that Rajesh Kumar

     Gupta (supra) ignored the mandate of
Section 8(c)
of the NDPS Act and that it

     was wrongly decided. Therefore, the intention of the legislature along with the

     true import and meaning of
Section 8(c)
read with the relevant rules was always

     that the dealing in of any psychotropic substance mentioned under the
Schedule

     to the Act
in contravention of the provisions of the Act and Rules framed

     thereunder, must necessarily be punished.
The consistent line of decisions of
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                     Page 163 of 189
this Court, as elaborated by us in the preceding parts of this judgment, which

     pre-existed the decision in Rajesh Kumar Gupta (supra) and which also

     support the conclusion reached by
Sanjeev V Deshpande
(supra) and by us,

     serve as a testament to the undoubted position of law contained in the
NDPS

     Act
and its Rules, in this regard.
133. Furthermore, we are also not concerned with a scenario wherein the language

     of
Section 8
of the NDPS Act is visibly narrow and through the act of judicial

     interpretation, an unreasonably wide or expansive interpretation has been

     accorded to it by the decision in
Sanjeev V Deshpande
(supra) and also by us.

     On the contrary, it is our opinion that the construction to
Section 8
of the NDPS

     Act was inordinately restricted in Rajesh Kumar Gupta (supra) when the scope

     and ambit of the provision was clear in itself.
Hence, the decision in
Sanjeev V

     Deshpande
(supra) taken along with the elaborate discussion which we have

     engaged in on the position of law, has only served to clarify the true meaning

     as exactly reflected in the statute, without any undue narrowing or expansion.
Therefore, there is no doubt in our mind while clarifying that the decision in
Sanjeev V Deshpande
(supra) overruling the decision in Rajesh Kumar Gupta

     (supra) would have retrospective effect, that there would arise no adverse

     implications as regards the
Article 20(1)
rights which the accused persons are

     otherwise entitled to.
136. The decisions of this Court in
Rao Shiv Bahadur Singh
(supra),
Soni

     Devrajbhai Babubhai
(supra) and
R.R. Kishore
(supra) would not in any

     manner be an impediment to the above conclusion since – First, in
Rao Shiv

     Bahadur Singh
(supra), it was opined that the expression “law in force” must

     be understood as being the law in fact in existence and in operation at the time

     of commission of the offence as distinct from the law “deemed” to have become

     operative by virtue of the power of the legislature to pass retrospective laws.

     The same is inapplicable herein since; (a) we are not dealing with a situation

     where the legislature has introduced a new offence which is sought to be

     retrospectively enforced and (b) the overruling of a decision and the declaration

     of the right meaning of law is not attributed to the provision by the overruling

     court through a “deeming fiction”. The overruling decision only mirrors what

     the lawmakers wanted the law to be and what it always was. Therefore, it

     cannot be disputed that the interpretation given in the overruling decision was

     infallibly the “law in force” at all times.
Secondly, in
Soni Devrajbhai

     Babubhai
(supra), it was apparent that the offences were traceable to two

     different provisions, the latter of which created a distinct offence and entered

     into the statute books much later in time. Therefore, it could be said without
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                    Page 167 of 189
any doubt that a new offence was “created”.
Thirdly, in
R.R. Kishore
(supra).
138.
In
Somaiya
(supra), this Court had emphasized that it cannot be said that the

     past actions would be validated when the doctrine of prospective overruling is

     resorted to. Therefore, the idea is not to declare all the actions that were taken

     contrary to law or in pursuance of an unconstitutional provision as valid, but to

     save those transactions on a balance of considerations.
Similarly, if the accused

     before us had been acquitted directly as a consequence of the decision in Rajesh

     Kumar Gupta (supra), the same cannot be said to have been made in

     accordance with law. Although, we have expressed our intention to not disturb

     any acquittal made in the past, which have attained finality, if the accused

     persons before us were acquitted by the respective Trial Courts due to the

     interpretation given in Rajesh Kumar Gupta (supra) and after an examination

     of materials placed on record, we were satisfied that the accused before us were

     indeed guilty of the offence with which they were charged, we could have held

     them “technically guilty” of the offence under
Section 8
of the NDPS Act.
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                     Page 169 of 189
139. This concept of “technical guilt” found mention in the decision of this Court in
Food Inspector, Calicut Corporation v. Cherukattil Gopalan and Another
reported in (1971) 2 SCC 322. Here, the issue was whether the respondent

     running a tea-stall could be said to have “sold” the sugar to the Food Inspector

     under
Section 2(xiii)
of the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act, 1954 and

     hence fall under the ambit of
Sections 7
and
16(1)(a)(i)
of the Act which

     prohibits and punishes the manufacture, sale etc. of adulterated articles of food.

     The counsel for the appellant had, during the course of the arguments, made it

     clear that the appellant did not want the respondents to be convicted in case his

     contentions were accepted and that the Corporation only wished to clarify the

     legal position on the aforesaid issue. In conclusion, while this Court agreed with

     the contentions of the appellant, the respondents were only held to be

     “technically guilty” of the offence with which they were charged and this Court

     opined that they had been wrongly acquitted by the High Court and the Trial

     Court respectively. The relevant observations are reproduced below:
144. The Court may alter or add to any charge either upon its own motion or on an

     application by the parties concerned. Therefore, such a power can be invoked

     by the Court suo moto as well. This power under
Section 216
CrPC is exclusive

     to the concerned Court and no party can seek such an addition or alteration of

     charge as a matter of right by filing an application. It would be the Trial Court

     which must decide whether a proper charge has been framed or not, at the

     appropriate stage of the trial. On a consideration of the broad probabilities of
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                    Page 173 of 189
the case, the total effect of the evidence and documents adduced, the Trial Court

     must satisfy itself that the exercise of power under Section 216 is necessary.

     The provision has been enacted with the salutary object to ensure a fair and full

     trial to the accused person(s) in each case.
145. This Court in
Anant Prakash Sinha v. State of Haryana and Another
reported

     in (2016) 6 SCC 105 summarised the principles as regards
Section 216
CrPC.

     Herein, charges were framed against the appellant-husband for the commission

     of offences punishable under
Sections 498-A
and
323
IPC. During the

     pendency of the matter, the informant wife had filed an application under
Section 216
CrPC for framing an additional charge under
Section 406
IPC

     against both the husband and the mother-in-law on the ground that there was

     an express complaint with regard to the misappropriation of her entire Stridhan

     and other articles. Hence, it was contended that the accused persons had

     committed criminal breach of trust, however, a charge sheet was not filed in

     respect of the said offence. The application was allowed by the Trial Court and

     subsequently, the Revisional Court upheld the framing of charge under
Section

     406
IPC only against the appellant-husband. This Court while agreeing with

     the High Court summarised the principles underlying
Section 216
CrPC as

     follows:
147. P. Ramanatha Aiyar in his Law Lexicon (6th Edn.) defined “alter” as “to make

     a change in; to modify; to vary in some degree”. “Alteration” is defined as a
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                    Page 177 of 189
“change or substitution of one thing for another”. Further, it has been

     elaborated that the term “alter” is to be distinguished from its synonyms i.e.,

     “change” and “amend”. To change something may import the substitution of

     an entirely different thing, while on the other hand, to alter would be to operate

     upon a subject matter which continues to be the same objectively while just

     modified in some particular. To illustrate it better in the context of charging an

     accused with an offence, let’s say an accused is charged with an offence

     initially under
Section 323
IPC for simple hurt. If the Trial Court is of the

     opinion that the case is in fact one of grievous hurt, it may alter the charge of

     the accused for an offence under
Section 325
IPC. This would be an alteration

     since the broad subject matter continues to be the same. Further, to amend

     would imply that the modification made in the subject improves it, which might

     not necessarily be the case with an alteration. In other words, an amendment

     may involve an alteration but an alteration does not always amend.
148.
In
Sohan Lal and Others v. State of Rajasthan
reported in (1990) 4 SCC 580,

     this Court while holding that an application under Section 216 would not be

     maintainable against persons who have already been discharged, elaborated the

     meaning of the words “alter and add to” as follows:
149. Therefore, to alter a charge would be to vary an existing charge and make a

     different charge. Hence, when the Court exercises its power under Section 216,

     either on its own motion or on an application made by the parties, and “alters”

     a charge, it would be necessary that the existing charge be varied and a new

     charge be made. In the instant case, in Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013, the

     Trial Court in its order dated 30.11.2006 had held that the charge framed by his

     predecessor for the offence under
Sections 8
,
22
and
29
of the NDPS Act had

     not been made out and that the case of the accused had to be a case under the

     D&C Act which would be triable by the Metropolitan Magistrate. In Criminal

     Appeal No. 272 of 2014, again, the Trial Court in its order dated 17.04.2010

     similarly held that the offences under
Sections 8
and
22
of the NDPS Act were

     not made out and the matter would fall within the rigours of the D&C Act.
152.
In a recent decision of this Court in
K. Ravi v. State of Tamil Nadu and

     Another
reported in 2024 SCC OnLine SC 2283, this Court had categorically

     observed that Section 216 does not give any right to the accused to file a fresh

     application seeking discharge after the charge has been framed by the Court.

     Herein, several accused were charge-sheeted under
Sections 147
,
148
,
323
,
324
,
307
and
302
of the IPC respectively. The respondent no. 2 - accused filed

     an application for discharge under
Section 227
CrPC which was dismissed by

     the Sessions Court. After charges were framed, the respondent no.2 along with

     the other accused then filed an application under
Section 216
CrPC seeking

     alteration of charge, which was also dismissed. In revision, the High Court,

     however, set aside the charge framed against the respondent no. 2. While

     holding that an accused cannot seek a discharge under the garb of

     modification/alteration of charge through a Section 216 application, this Court
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                   Page 180 of 189
also highlighted that it has become routine practice for the accused to file an

     application under
Section 216
CrPC after their application for discharge under
Section 227
CrPC is dismissed, sometimes in ignorance of the law but also on

     other occasions with the sole intent of derailing the trial. The relevant

     observations are as thus:
153. A few High Courts have also rightly taken the view that an application under
Section 216
CrPC cannot lead to the deletion of charge or the discharge of an

     accused.
In a relatively recent decision of the High Court of Allahabad in
Dev

     Narain v. State of U.P. and Another
reported in 2023 SCC OnLine All 3216,

     it was stated that a prayer for discharge cannot be sustained in an application

     under
Section 216
CrPC. Herein the sole-accused moved an application for

     discharge and the same was rejected. The application under
Section 482
CrPC

     filed before the High Court was also dismissed but with the observation that “it

     is open to the applicant to move an application for alteration of charge under
Section 216
CrPC before the Trial Court”. Charges were framed against the

     accused under
Sections 498-A
,
304-B
,
323
IPC and
Sections 3
and
4
of the

     Dowry prohibition Act, 1961. After the evidence of PW-1 was recorded, the

     accused moved an application under
Section 216
CrPC for alteration of charge

     and the same also came to be dismissed by the Trial Court. The High Court

     stated that the alteration of charge and deletion of charge hold different field

     and that these two cannot be intermingled. A perusal of the prayer made by the

     accused in the 216
CrPC
application indicated that it was, in essence, a prayer

     for discharge and quashing of the charges levelled against him. Therefore, it

     was held that such a power to delete charges is not conferred on the Court under
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                   Page 182 of 189
Section 216
CrPC. It was added that a charge once framed, it must lead either

     to an acquittal or conviction at the end of the trial and charges cannot be

     permitted to be deleted mid-trial. The relevant observations are reproduced

     hereinbelow:
I am in agreement with this conclusion. The petitioner is seeking
           the deletion of a charge of conspiracy altogether that is not
           permissible under Section 216 of the Code. The charge once
           framed must lead to either acquittal or conviction at the
           conclusion of trial. Section 216 of the Code does not permit the
           deletion of the same. Subsequently, Delhi High Court in the case
           of
Verghese Stephen v. Central Bureau Of Investigation
, 2007 Cri
           LJ 4080, placed reliance on aforesaid judgment of this Court in
           the case of
Vibhuti Narayan Chaubey
(supra).”

                                                   (Emphasis supplied)
158. There arises no occasion for us to declare the interpretation given to
Section 8
of the NDPS Act and the relevant NDPS Rules, by the decision in Sanjeev V.

     Deshpande (supra), as prospectively applicable. There exists no overwhelming

     reason for us to do so. On the other hand, in order to meet the ends of justice

     and with a view to ensure that public interest is safeguarded and to give effect

     to the salutary object behind the enactment of the
NDPS Act
, the decision must

     necessarily be retrospectively applicable. This Court in Sanjeev V. Deshpande

     (supra), perhaps, did not think fit to confine or restrict its interpretation of
Section 8
of the NDPS Act to future cases only.
This is evinced from the fact
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                   Page 186 of 189
that whilst overruling Rajesh Kumar Gupta (supra), it deliberately chose not

     to discuss the doctrine of prospective overruling let alone resort to it. This

     conspicuous silence in
Sanjeev Deshpande
(supra) as regards the prospective

     or retrospective effect of overruling Rajesh Kumar Gupta (supra) has to be

     borne in mind and given due deference. As a natural corollary to the aforesaid,

     we see no reason why we should deviate from the default rule of retrospectivity

     and instead, resort to the doctrine of prospective overruling.
Therefore, pending

     cases, if any, which were instituted before the decision of this Court in Sanjeev

     V. Deshpande (supra) would also be governed by the law as clarified by it.
160. However, having held that the decision in Sanjeev V. Deshpande (supra) must

     be given retrospective effect, we find it necessary to clarify that acquittals

     which have already been recorded as a consequence of the decision in Rajesh

     Kumar Gupta (supra) and have attained finality, would not be unsettled in light

     of the overruling decision in Sanjeev V. Deshpande (supra) or the observations

     made by us.

(J.B. Pardiwala)



                                            ……………………………………… J.Thus it being Schedule ‘H’ drug, it would fall within the rigors of
Drugs and Cosmetics Act
and Rules.
State, exporting inter-State, importing into India, exporting from India or

     transhipment of any narcotic drug or psychotropic substance, except for

     medical or scientific purposes and in the manner and to the extent provided

     by the provisions of this Act or the rules or orders made thereunder.
29. It was then submitted that
Section 80
of the NDPS Act provides that the

     provisions of the
NDPS Act
and Rules made thereunder, shall be in addition to,

     and not in derogation of the D&C Act, 1940 or the Rules made thereunder.

     Therefore, the High Court wrongly held that the psychotropic substance in the

     present case is governed exclusively by the D&C Act without attracting an

     offence under the
NDPS Act
.
a.
Object of the NDPS Act
and the United Nations Convention on
       Psychotropic Substances, 1971.
39. Before we advert to the rival submissions canvassed on either side, it would be

      apposite to first look into the object and history behind the enactment of the
NDPS Act
and its Rules along with the broad scheme of the United Nations

      Convention on Psychotropic Substances, 1971.
However, with the passage of time and the development in the field
           of illicit drug traffic and during abuse at national and
           international level, many deficiencies in the existing laws have
           come to notice. Therefore, in order to remove such deficiencies
           and difficulties, there was urgent need for the enactment of a
           comprehensive legislation on narcotic drugs and psychotropic
           substances, which led to enactment of the
NDPS Act
. As observed
           hereinabove, the Act is a special law and has a laudable purpose
           to serve and is intended to combat the menace otherwise bent upon
           destroying the public health and national health. The guilty must
           be in and the innocent ones must be out. The punishment part in
           drug trafficking is an important one but its preventive part is more
           important. Therefore, prevention of illicit traffic in the
Narcotic
           Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985
came to be
           introduced. The aim was to prevent illicit traffic rather than punish
           after the offence was committed. Therefore, the courts will have to
           safeguard the life and liberty of the innocent persons. Therefore,
           the provisions of the
NDPS Act
are required to be interpreted
           keeping in mind the object and purpose of the
NDPS Act
; impact
           on the society as a whole and the Act is required to be interpreted
           literally and not liberally which may ultimately frustrate the
           object, purpose and Preamble of the Act [...].”

44.
Article 1(e)
of the Convention defines a “psychotropic substance” as any

     substance, natural or synthetic, or any natural material in Schedules I, II, III or

     IV of the Convention.
Article 4
provides that, as regards the substances other

     than those mentioned in Schedule I i.e., in Schedule II, II and IV respectively,

     the States may permit – (a) the carrying by international travellers of small

     quantities of lawfully obtained preparations for personal use; (b) the use of such

     psychotropic substances in industry for the manufacture of non-psychotropic

     substances or products subject to the application of control measures until the

     psychotropic substances come to be in such a condition that they will not be

     abused or recovered in practice; and (c) the use of such psychotropic substances

     for the capture of animals by specifically authorised persons subject to the

     application of control measures.
Article 5
, in addition, states that the

     manufacture, export, import, distribution, stocking, trade, use and possession,

     of substances in Schedules II, III and IV respectively, must be limited to

     medical and scientific purposes, except for those purposes already enumerated

     under
Article 4.
Furthermore,
Article 5
states that it would be desirable if States
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                       Page 34 of 189
do not permit the possession of substances mentioned in Schedules II, III and

      IV respectively, except under legal authority.
45.   As per
Article 8
, the manufacture of, trade in, and distribution of substances

      listed in Schedules II, III and IV respectively, must also be under a licence or

      other similar control measures, provided that the requirements of licencing or

      other control measures need not apply to persons who are duly authorised to

      perform or are performing therapeutic or scientific functions.
Article 9
states

      that the substances in Schedules II, III and IV respectively, shall be supplied or

      dispensed for use by individuals only pursuant to a medical prescription except

      when being lawfully obtained, used, dispensed or administered in the duly

      authorised exercise of therapeutic or scientific functions.
46. In so far as the substances mentioned in Schedule I are concerned,
Articles 4
and
7
respectively state that their use shall be prohibited except for scientific

      and very limited medical purposes, by duly authorized persons in medical or

      scientific establishments, which are either directly under the control of the

      government or specifically approved by them. Such persons performing

      medical or scientific functions must be required to maintain records concerning

      the acquisition of the substances and the details of their use which must be
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                       Page 35 of 189
preserved for at least two years after the last use recorded therein. States must

     also require that the manufacture, trade, distribution and possession of Schedule

     I substances be under a special licence or prior authorization and be closely

     supervised. The quantity of Schedule I substances supplied to a duly authorised

     person must also be restricted to such level as required for his authorized

     purpose. The export and import of Schedule I substances shall be prohibited

     except when both the exporter and importer are the competent authorities or

     agencies of the exporting or importing country, or other persons or enterprises

     which are specifically authorised for that purpose. During the export and import

     as enumerated above, the authorities or persons specifically authorized must

     have export and import authorizations for the substances mentioned in

     Schedule I.
48.
Article 12
elaborates on the provisions relating to international trade and states

     that every State permitting the export or import of substances in Schedules I or

     II respectively, shall require a separate import or export authorization which

     shall state the international non-proprietary name or the designation of the

     substance in the Schedule, the quantity to be exported or imported, the

     pharmaceutical form, the name and address of the exporter and importer, and

     the period within which the export or import must be effected. Additionally,

     the export authorization shall also state the number and date of the import

     authorization and the authority by whom it has been issued. Before an export
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                       Page 37 of 189
authorization is issued, the States shall require an import authorization issued

     by the competent authority of the importing country or region which certifies

     that the importing of the substance(s) referred to therein is approved and such

     an authorization shall be produced by the person or establishment while

     applying for the export authorization. A copy of the export authorisation is to

     accompany each consignment and the government issuing the export

     authorisation shall also send a copy to the government of the importing country

     or region. When the importation has been effected, the government of the

     importing country or region shall then return the export authorization to the

     government of the exporting country or region, with an endorsement certifying

     the amount of the substance which has actually been imported.
51.   On a closer look at the substances mentioned in the Schedules to the

      Convention, it is evident that Buprenorphine and its salt Buprenorphine

      Hydrochloride is listed under Schedule III. Therefore, according to the scheme

      of the Convention, the manufacture, distribution, stocking, and possession of

      Buprenorphine and its salt Buprenorphine Hydrochloride shall be limited to

      medical and scientific purposes in addition to the limited purposes as provided

      in
Article 4.
The Convention casts a mandate upon States that the manufacture

      of, trade in and distribution of Buprenorphine and its salt Buprenorphine

      Hydrochloride be under a licence or other similar control measure. The only

      exception being that such a licence or other control measure need not

      necessarily apply to persons who are duly authorised to perform therapeutic or

      scientific functions.
b.     Relevant Statutory Provisions of the NDPS Act and its Rules

Section 2(xxiii)
of the NDPS Act defines a “Psychotropic substance” as –

            “any substance, natural or synthetic, or any natural material or
            any salt or preparation of such substance or material included in
            the list of psychotropic substances specified in the Schedule”
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                        Page 40 of 189
A bare reading of the definition would indicate that all items listed in

     the
Schedule to the Act
along with its salts and preparations come within the

     purview of a “psychotropic substance” under the
NDPS Act
.
53.
Section 8
of the NDPS Act prohibits certain operations and reads as thus:
54.   The mandate under
Section 8
is that no person shall produce, manufacture,

      possess, sell, purchase, transport, warehouse, use, consume, import inter-State,

      export inter-State, import into India, export from India or tranship (hereinafter

      collectively referred to as “deal in/dealing in”) any narcotic drug or

      psychotropic substance, except for medical or scientific purposes and in the

      manner and to the extent provided by the provisions of this Act or the rules or

      orders made thereunder. In a case where any such provision imposes any

      requirement by way of licence, permit or authorisation, the narcotic drugs and

      psychotropic substances must also be dealt in accordance with the terms and

      conditions of such licence, permit or authorisation. The term “psychotropic

      substance” mentioned in
Section 8
must be seen in light of
Section 2(xxiii)
which refers to the
Schedule to the Act
and all the psychotropic substances

      mentioned therein. Additionally, to bring a case within the exception carved

      out under
Section 8
, each of the conditions specified therein must be satisfied.

      In other words, for the accused to take the plea that his dealing in the narcotic

      drug or psychotropic substance does not constitute an offence under
Section 8
,

      it must be proved that the drug or substance was being dealt with (a) for medical

      or scientific purposes AND; (b) in the manner and to the extent provided by the

      provisions of the
NDPS Act
or the NDPS Rules or the orders made thereunder

      AND; (c) in accordance with the terms and conditions of the licence, permit or

      authorisation, if any.
56. Therefore, if any psychotropic substance mentioned in the
Schedule to the Act
is being dealt with for a purpose other than medical or scientific purposes, an
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                     Page 43 of 189
offence under
Section 8(c)
of the NDPS Act would be made out. Furthermore,

     if any psychotropic substance mentioned in the
Schedule to the Act
is being

     dealt with for a medical or scientific purpose, but not in accordance with other

     provisions of the Act, rules, orders or, the terms and conditions of the licence,

     permit or authorisations, if any, then also, an offence under
Section 8(c)
of the

     NDPS Act could be said to have been made out. It is only when the exception

     is complied with entirely or wholly, that an accused can lay claim to the benefit

     provided under the said provision.
57.
Section 9
of the NDPS Act empowers the Central Government to permit and

     regulate certain activities subject to the provisions of
Section 8
. The same reads

     thus:
58.
Section 76
of the NDPS Act also empowers the Central Government to make

      rules for carrying out the purposes of the
NDPS Act
and reads thus:
59.   The NDPS Rules, 1985, have been brought into being by the Central

      Government in exercise of its powers under
Sections 9
and
76
of the NDPS

      Act, respectively
referred to above
. However, what must necessarily be kept in

      mind is that the power conferred upon the Central Government under
Sections

      9
and
76
of the NDPS Act, respectively, is subject to
Section 8
and this is

      evident by the use of the phrase “subject to the provisions of
Section 8
” and

      “subject to the other provisions of the Act” in both the provisions. Therefore,

      the NDPS rules must not be understood as laying down standards different from

      or inconsistent with the substantive provisions of the
NDPS Act
, especially
Section 8
and the
Schedule to the NDPS Act
. The underlying object of the

      NDPS rules is to “permit and regulate” certain activities for carrying out the

      purposes of the
NDPS Act
and not to “prohibit” those activities.
60. Rule 2(k) of the NDPS Rules, 1985, states that – “words and expressions used

      herein and not defined, but defined in the Act shall have the meanings

      respectively assigned to them in the Act.”. Therefore, any reference to

      “psychotropic substances” under the NDPS Rules must relate to the definition

      provided under
Section 2(xxiii)
of the NDPS Act, which consists of the entire

      list of psychotropic substances enumerated under the
Schedule to the Act
.

      Chapter VI of the NDPS rules relate to the import, export and transhipment of

      narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances and Chapter VII deals with the
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                    Page 46 of 189
manufacture, sale, purchase, consumption, use, possession and transport of

      psychotropic substances. Chapter VIIA details certain special provisions

      regarding the manufacture, possession, transport, import-export, purchase and

      consumption of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances for medical,

      scientific and training purposes. It would be apposite to mention at this stage

      that the NDPS rules have undergone some significant changes over the years.

      However, our inquiry would be limited to the version of the NDPS Rules as it

      existed during the time the offence is alleged to have been committed in the

      present case i.e., as on 27.09.2003.
61.   Chapters VI and VII respectively, contain Rules 53 to 63 and 64 to 67

      respectively. Under Chapter VI, Rule 53 provides for a general prohibition and

      states that subject to the other provisions of this Chapter, the import into and

      export out of India of the narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances specified

      in “Schedule I appended to the Rules” is prohibited. However, an exception to

      this general rule was carved out under its first proviso by stating that nothing

      in this rule shall apply in case “the drug substance” is imported into or exported

      out of India subject to an import certificate or export authorisation issued under

      the provision of this Chapter and for the purpose mentioned under Chapter

      VIIA. The expression “the drug substance” mentioned in the proviso must

      naturally be read to mean a “Schedule I substance” since the language of Rule
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                       Page 47 of 189
53 is phrased such that it alludes to a Schedule I substance only. Therefore, in

      short, the import and export of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances

      specifically mentioned under Schedule I of the Rules is generally disallowed

      provided that person may import and export them, with a valid import

      certificate or export authorisation, for the limited purposes mentioned under

      Chapter VIIA.
62.   Rule 55 on the ‘Application for an Import Certificate’ provides that, subject to

      Rule 53 as enumerated above, no narcotic drug or psychotropic substance

      specified in the “
Schedule of the Act
” shall be imported into India without an

      import certificate, in respect of the consignment, issued by the issuing

      authority, as per the form appended to the Rules. Rule 57 on ‘Transit’ states

      that subject to the provisions of
Section 79
of the NDPS Act and Rule 53, no

      consignment of any narcotic drug or psychotropic substance specified in the

      “
Schedule of the Act
” shall be allowed to be transited through India unless such

      consignment is accompanied by a valid export authorisation in this behalf

      issued by the Government of the exporting country. Rule 58 relating to the

      ‘Application for Export Authorisation’ provides that, subject to Rules 53 and

      53A, no narcotic drugs or psychotropic substances specified in the “
Schedule

      of the Act
” shall be exported out of India without an export authorisation in

      respect of the consignment, issued by the issuing authority in the requisite form
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                      Page 48 of 189
appended to the Rules. Rule 60 relating to ‘Transhipment’ provides that, subject

      to the provisions of
Section 79
of the NDPS Act and Rule 53, no consignment

      of narcotic drug or psychotropic substance specified in the “
Schedule to the

      Act
” shall be allowed to be transhipped at any port in India save with the

      permission of the Collector of Customs. Rule 61 on the ‘Procedure for

      Transhipment’ states that while allowing any consignment of narcotic drug or

      psychotropic substance specified in the “
Schedule to the Act
” to be transhipped,

      the Collector of Customs shall inter alia satisfy himself that the consignment

      is accompanied by a valid export authorisation issued by the exporting country.
63.   What is discernible from the aforementioned rules under Chapter VI is that the

      import into and export out of India of all psychotropic substances (as listed in

      the
Schedule to the Act
) must be accompanied by a valid import certificate and

      export authorisation issued by the issuing authority in India. As regards the

      transit and transhipment of any psychotropic substance (as listed in the
Schedule to the Act
) in India, a valid export authorisation issued by the

      exporting country is a requisite. On the other hand, what Rule 53 seeks to

      achieve is to restrict the import and export of substances enumerated in

      Schedule I of the Rules to a pre-determined set of purposes as explained under

      Chapter VIIA, despite having obtained an import certificate or export

      authorisation under the other rules of this Chapter. This provision i.e., Rule 53
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                      Page 49 of 189
relating to the Schedule I substances must not be flouted and this is especially

      evident through the phrase “subject to Rule 53” featuring in almost every rule

      under this Chapter. It is therefore, clear that, as far as import or export is

      concerned, the substances mentioned in Schedule I appended to the Rules are

      more strictly regulated or restricted in comparison to the larger list of

      psychotropic substances mentioned in the
Schedule to the Act
. However, this

      is not to say that the psychotropic substances mentioned only in the
Schedule

      to the Act
are unregulated. Furthermore, it also cannot be said that the

      substances mentioned in Schedule I of the NDPS Rules are absolutely

      prohibited from being imported or exported as per
Section 8
of the NDPS Act

      since they are clearly allowed to be validly imported and exported for the

      limited purposes enumerated under Chapter VIIA.
65. What can be discerned from the Rules 64 and 65 respectively, elaborated

     hereinabove is that: First, the manufacture of all psychotropic substances (as

     listed in the
Schedule to the Act
) must be in accordance with the conditions

     prescribed in the licence granted under the D&C Rules and the permissible

     quantity to be manufactured would be intimated to the licensee at the time the

     licence is issued. Notwithstanding the prohibition to deal in psychotropic

     substances contained in
Section 8(c)
of the NDPS Act, the manufacture thereof

     is permitted subject to compliance with the D&C Act and its Rules. Secondly,

     there is a general rule absolutely prohibiting the manufacture, possession,

     transport, import inter-State, export inter-State, sale, purchase, consumption or

     use of any of the psychotropic substances which find mention in Schedule I

     appended to the Rules. However, the above activities can be done vis-á-vis the
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                     Page 52 of 189
substances mentioned in Schedule I appended to the Rules if their manufacture,

     possession, transport, import inter-State, export inter-State, sale, purchase,

     consumption or use is in accordance with other provisions of the Chapter which

     generally apply to all psychotropic substances (as listed in the
Schedule to the

     Act
) and for the limited purposes mentioned under Chapter VIIA. In other

     words, Schedule I substances can also be dealt in, in due compliance with the

     rules applicable generally to all the psychotropic substances but specifically

     only for the purposes mentioned under Chapter VIIA. However, while issuing

     a licence of manufacture with respect to the Schedule I substances, the

     Licensing Authority shall consult the Narcotics Commissioner. Therefore,

     Rules 64 and 65 respectively, permit the manufacture of psychotropic

     substances mentioned under Schedule I of the Rules however subject to certain

     provisions and purposes. This can be culled out from a holistic reading of Rules

     64 and 65 respectively, and the two provisos which follow Rule 65(3). Thirdly,

     the manufacture of all psychotropic substances (as listed in the
Schedule to the

     Act
), and those mentioned under Schedule I of the Rules specifically for the

     purposes elaborated under Chapter VIIA, in violation of the conditions of

     licence of manufacture issued under the D&C Act would amount to a

     contravention of Rule 65 of the NDPS Rules and thereby
Section 8
of the NDPS

     Act itself. Therefore, when such a contravention of the conditions of licence

     occurs, it cannot be said that an offence under the
NDPS Act
would not be made
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                    Page 53 of 189
out and that the contravention would be solely covered by the D&C regime.
Due to the operation of Rule 65, violation of any of the conditions of licence

      under the D&C Act read with its Rules would ipso facto tantamount to a

      violation of the
NDPS Act
read with its Rules as well.
66.   Rule 66 on ‘Possession etc. of psychotropic substances’ states that no person

      shall possess any psychotropic substance (as listed in the
Schedule to the Act
)

      for any of the purposes covered by the D&C Rules, unless he is lawfully

      authorised to possess such substance for any of the said purposes under these

      rules. Therefore, what is being conveyed herein is that as far as substances

      mentioned under Schedule I are concerned, they can be possessed only for the

      purposes mentioned under Chapter VIIA, and as far as the other substances not

      being Schedule I substances but which are listed in the
Schedule to the Act
are

      concerned, they can be possessed for the purposes mentioned under Chapter

      VIIA and also for other purposes which necessarily fall under the broader

      considerations of medical or scientific purposes as mentioned under
Section 8
of the NDPS Act. This compliance is in addition to the accused persons

      possessing the said substances in accordance with the purposes elaborated

      under the D&C Rules and the requirements thereunder. Sub-rule (2), however,

      allows any research institution or a hospital or a dispensary maintained or

      supported by the Government or local body or by charity or voluntary
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                    Page 54 of 189
subscription, which is not normally authorised to possess the psychotropic

     substances under the D&C Rules, or any person who is not so authorised under

     the D&C Rules, to possess a reasonable quantity of such substance as may be

     necessary for their genuine scientific or medical requirements or both, for such

     period as is deemed necessary by the said research institution or hospital or

     dispensary or person, as the case may be. In case, of an individual person,

     possessing the substance for his personal medical use, the quantity shall not

     exceed one 100 dosage units at a time. The research institution, hospital and

     dispensary referred to herein shall maintain proper accounts and records in

     relation to the purchase and consumption of the psychotropic substance in their

     possession.
67. Rule 67 on ‘Transport of psychotropic substance’ provides that, subject to the

     provisions of Rule 64, no consignment of psychotropic substance shall be

     transported, imported inter-State or exported inter-State unless such a

     consignment is accompanied by a consignment note appended to the Rules and

     in the manner provided under the Rules. The consignor and consignee must

     keep the consignment note for a period of two years and the said note may be

     inspected at any time by an officer authorised in this behalf by the Central

     Government. This Rule would again apply to all psychotropic substances (as

     mentioned under the
Schedule to the Act
).
68. At this stage, it may be observed that it was vide a notification dated 25th June,

     1997 that Chapter VIIA containing Rule 67A came to be inserted in the NDPS

     Rules. Chapter VIIA states that, notwithstanding anything contained in the

     foregoing provisions of these Rules, a narcotic drug or psychotropic substance

     may be used for - (i) scientific requirements including analytical requirements

     of any Government laboratory or any research institution in India or abroad; or
(ii) very limited medical requirements of a foreigner by a duly authorised

     person of a hospital or any other establishment of the Government especially

     approved by that foreign Government; or (iii) the purpose of de-addiction of

     drug addicts by the Government or local body or by an approved charity or

     voluntary organisation or by such other institution as may be approved by the

     Central Government. The persons performing medical or scientific functions as

     mentioned hereinabove shall maintain records concerning the acquisition of the

     substance and the details of their use in Form 7 of these rules and such records

     are to be preserved for at least two years. Furthermore, a narcotic drug or

     psychotropic substance may be supplied or dispensed for use to a foreigner

     pursuant to a medical prescription only from authorised licensed pharmacists

     or other authorised retail distributors designated by authorities responsible for

     public health.
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                     Page 56 of 189
69. Upon a meticulous analysis of the NDPS rules relating to psychotropic

     substances and analysing the purposes for which they are to be dealt in, along

     with the requirements and procedures to be complied with for each kind of

     dealing in the psychotropic substances, an underlying idea resonates throughout

     these rules i.e., that any dealing in the psychotropic substances mentioned under

     Schedule I of the Rules must strictly be in accordance with the NDPS Rules

     AND ONLY for the purposes enumerated under Chapter VIIA of the NDPS

     Rules. The substances not finding a mention under Schedule I of the Rules but

     listed in the
Schedule to the Act
must also meet with the requirements cast upon

     by the NDPS Rules. The difference as regards these substances however is that

     while they may be dealt with for the purposes enumerated under Chapter VIIA

     of the NDPS Rules, they can also be dealt with for other purposes, provided

     that those purposes strictly fall under the larger umbrella of “medical or

     scientific purposes” as provided for in
Section 8
of the NDPS Act. Whether the

     accused has dealt with it within the confines of the expression “medical or

     scientific purposes” must obviously be determined on the facts and

     circumstances of each case. It can therefore be said that the substances under

     Schedule I to the Rules are more strictly restricted compared to the remaining

     psychotropic substances under the
Schedule to the Act
which are restricted

     more moderately in comparison. On this aspect, our scheme is more or less

     similar to the scheme of the Convention on Psychotropic substances, 1971. The
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                     Page 57 of 189
different levels in restriction could be seen as the primary reason behind

      providing two different schedules, i.e., one under the Act and another under the

      Rules.
Moreover, the Schedule to the Act
can be considered as a superset of all

      psychotropic substances wherein those substances mentioned under Schedule I

      of the Rules form a small, more restricted subset of the larger superset.



c.     Analysing the treatment of substances mentioned in the
Schedule to
       the Act
and not in Schedule I of the Rules by previous decisions of this
       Court.

71.   Therefore, the dictum as laid in
Hussain
(supra) is that “Buprenorphine

      tidigesic” is a psychotropic substance to which the rigours of
Section 8
of the

      NDPS Act and Rule 66 of the NDPS Rules would apply, however, as the
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                      Page 61 of 189
accused was found to be in possession of less than 100 dosage units of the

     substance, with a valid medical prescription, for his personal medical use, he

     was held to have not committed an offence under
Section 8
of the NDPS Act

     as there was no violation of Rule 66.


(Emphasis supplied)
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                      Page 71 of 189
77.   Again in
D. Ramakrishnan v. Intelligence Officer, Narcotic Control Bureau
reported in (2009) 14 SCC 603, the appellant and a co-accused were engaged

      in the internet pharmacy business and were alleged to have exported drugs

      abroad including “Alprazolam”, “Lorazepam” and “Nitrazepam” which find

      place at S. Nos. 30, 56 and 64 of the
Schedule to the NDPS Act
respectively.

      Since the activities were carried on without a valid export authorisation as

      required under the NDPS regime, the appellant and his co-accused were

      prosecuted under
Section 8(c)
read with
Sections 22
,
23
,
25
,
27-A
,
53
,
53-A
and
58
of the NDPS Act.
Taking recourse to Rajesh Kumar Gupta (supra), it

      was argued that the drugs being Schedule G and H drugs under the D&C Rules

      and not mentioned in Schedule I to the NDPS Rules, its export thereof would

      not attract the provisions of Rule 58 of the NDPS Rules which requires an

      export authorisation. This is because Rules 53 and 64 respectively being the

      genus and dealing with substances under Schedule I of the NDPS Rules would
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                      Page 72 of 189
mean that Rule 58 is also applicable only to such Schedule I substances.
i.    First, this Court in its decision analysed the true scope and ambit of
Section 8(c)
of the NDPS Act and stated that
Section 8(c)
in no

           uncertain terms prohibits the dealing in any manner in any narcotic

           drug or psychotropic substance. However, an exception to such

           prohibition is also contained in the said section and that is, that the

           dealing in any narcotic drug or psychotropic substance would be

           permitted “in the manner and to the extent provided by the provisions

           of this Act or the Rules or Orders made thereunder”. Therefore, it was

           declared that a twin condition must be fulfilled i.e., the dealing must
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                    Page 74 of 189
be for medical or scientific purposes AND in the manner and to the

           extent provided by the provisions of the Act, Rules, or Orders made

           thereunder and the Court stated as thus:
Therefore, it cannot be said that the prohibition contained under
Section 8
would not be attracted in respect of all those psychotropic

           substances which find a mention only in the
Schedule to the Act
but

           not in Schedule I to the Rules framed under the Act. The relevant

           observations are as thus:
Unfortunately, the learned Judges in reaching such a
              conclusion ignored the mandate of
Section 8(c)
which inter alia
              prohibits in absolute terms import into and export out of India
              of any narcotic drug and psychotropic substance. Rules framed
              under the Act cannot be understood to create rights and
              obligations contrary to those contained in the parent Act.
30. On examination of the scheme of Rules 53 to 63 which
              appear in Chapter VI, we are of the opinion that Rule 53 [
              “53.General prohibition.—Subject to the other provisions of
              this Chapter, the import into and export out of India of the
              narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances specified in
              Schedule I is prohibited: Provided that nothing in this rule shall
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                      Page 78 of 189
apply in case the drug substance is imported into or exported
              out of India subject to an import certificate or export
              authorisation issued under the provision of this Chapter and for
              the purposes mentioned in Chapter VII-A.”] reiterates an
              aspect of the larger prohibition contained in
Section 8(c)
i.e. the
              prohibition of import into and export out of India of the narcotic
              drugs and psychotropic substances specified in Schedule I to the
              Rules. The proviso thereto however enables the import into and
              export out of India on the basis of an import certificate or export
              authorisation issued under the provisions of Chapter VI. The
              subsequent rules stipulate the conditions subject to which and
              the procedure to be followed by which some of the narcotic
              drugs and psychotropic substances could be imported into India
              or exported out of India. For example, opium is a narcotic drug
              by definition under
Section 2(xiv)
of the Act whose export and
              import is prohibited under
Section 8(c)
. But Rule 54 [
              “54.Import of opium, etc.—The import of—(i) opium,
              concentrate of poppy straw, and(ii) morphine, codeine,
              thebaine, and their salts is prohibited save by the Government
              Opium Factory; Provided that nothing in this rule shall apply
              to import of morphine, codeine, thebaine and their salts by
              manufacturers notified by the Government, for use in
              manufacture of products to be exported or to imports of small
              quantities of morphine, codeine and thebaine and their salts not
              exceeding a total of 1 kilogram during a calendar year for
              analytical purposes by an importer, after following the
              procedure under Rule 55 and subject to such conditions as may
              be specified in the import certificate issued in Form 4-
              A.”(emphasis supplied)] authorises the import of opium by the
              Government opium factory. The construction such as the one
              placed on Rule 53 in Rajesh Kumar Gupta case [
State of
              Uttaranchal v. Rajesh Kumar Gupta
, (2007) 1 SCC 355 :
31. Chapter VII deals with psychotropic substances. No doubt
              Rule 64 [ “64.General prohibition.—No person shall
              manufacture, possess, transport, import inter-State, export
              inter-State, sell, purchase, consume or use any of the
              psychotropic substances specified in Schedule I.”] once again
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                      Page 79 of 189
purports to prohibit various operations other than import into
              or export out of India in psychotropic substances specified in
              Schedule I for the obvious reason that import and export
              operations are already covered by Rule 53. Rule 65 authorises
              the manufacture of psychotropic substances other than those
              specified in Schedule I to the Rules subject to and in accordance
              with the conditions of a licence granted under the 1945 Rules.
              The rule also provides for various other incidental matters. Rule
              65-A prohibits the sale, purchase, consumption or use of any
              psychotropic substances except in accordance with the 1945
              Rules.
32. Rule 66 prohibits any person from having in possession any
              psychotropic substance even for any of the purposes authorised
              under the 1945 Rules unless the person in possession of such a
              psychotropic substance is lawfully authorised to possess such
              substance for any of the purposes mentioned under the 1985
              Rules. Persons who are authorised under the 1985 Rules, and
              the quantities of the material such persons are authorised to
              possess, are specified under Rule 66(2). They are:
33. Rule 66 reads as follows:
34. On the above analysis of the provisions of Chapters VI and
              VII of the 1985 Rules, we are of the opinion, both these chapters
              contain rules permitting and regulating the import and export
              of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances other than those
              specified in Schedule I to the 1985 Rules subject to various
              conditions and procedure stipulated in Chapter VI. Whereas
              Chapter VII deals exclusively with various other aspects
              of dealing in psychotropic substances and the conditions
              subject to which such dealing in is permitted. We are of the
              opinion that both Rules 53 and 64 are really in the nature of
              exception to the general scheme of Chapters VI and VII
              respectively containing a list of narcotic drugs and
              psychotropic substances which cannot be dealt in any manner
              notwithstanding the other provisions of these two chapters. We
              are of the clear opinion that neither Rule 53 nor Rule 64 is a
              source of authority for prohibiting the dealing in narcotic drugs
              and psychotropic substances, the source is
Section 8
. Rajesh
              Kumar Gupta case [
State of Uttaranchal v. Rajesh Kumar
              Gupta
, (2007) 1 SCC 355 : (2007) 1 SCC (Cri) 356] in our view
              is wrongly decided.”
                                                    (Emphasis supplied)
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                    Page 81 of 189
Therefore, it was declared that it is only the psychotropic substances

           appended to Schedule I of the Rules which are regulated by the NDPS

           Rules, and dealing in substances, not finding a mention in Schedule I,

           would be unregulated and thus, not amount to an offence under
Section 8(c)
.
ii.   Sanjeev V. Deshpande (supra) while overruling Rajesh Kumar

           Gupta (supra) dispelled the idea that Rules 53 and 64 respectively,

           constituted a genus but instead stated that Rules 53 and 64

           respectively, are in the nature of an exception to the general scheme

           of their respective Chapters. To put it more clearly, that Rules 53 and

           64 respectively stated that substances under Schedule I of the Rules

           cannot be dealt with in any manner whatsoever and the other Rules in

           the Chapter proceeded to lay down the procedure and conditions

           under which substances other than those mentioned in Schedule I of

           the Rules but contained in the
Schedule to the Act
, could be dealt with.

           Therefore, if an accused is charged with an offence for dealing with a

           substance mentioned under the
Schedule to the Act
and not in

           Schedule I of the Rules, he would be guilty of an offence under
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                     Page 83 of 189
Section 8(c)
if the conditions and procedure laid down under the

            Rules, other than Rules 53 and 64, are not complied with.
81.   However, a detailed and comprehensive analysis of Chapters VI and VII of the

      NDPS Rules, inter alia, makes it clear that the substances mentioned under

      Schedule I of the Rules are not absolutely prohibited to be dealt in, as stated in

      Sanjeev V. Deshpande (supra). They are indeed allowed to be dealt with for

      the limited purposes as detailed in Chapter VIIA of the NDPS Rules. It goes

      without saying that in such dealing for the purposes mentioned under Chapter

      VIIA, persons would have to comply with the set of procedures and conditions

      to which the other substances are subjected to and strict compliance of all those

      rules are mandatory considering the high degree of havoc and menace that the

      substances mentioned in Schedule I to the NDPS Rules can create on public

      health and societal well-being.
82.   The NDPS rules were revamped in the year 2015 vide G.S.R. 224(E) dated

      25.03.2015 with a view to remove the ambiguity that the phrasing of several

      rules created. That the psychotropic substances mentioned under Schedule I of

      the NDPS Rules can also be dealt with but for the restricted and limited

      purposes enumerated under Chapter VIIA of the Rules and in compliance with

      the requirements under the other rules, is evident from the language of the rules
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                       Page 84 of 189
which came into effect post 25.03.2015. To illustrate, Rule 53 of the NDPS

      Rules now reads as thus:
d.     The provisions of the
NDPS Act
and its Rules are “in addition to” the
       D&C Act and the Rules made thereunder.
86.
Section 80
of the NDPS Act states that the application of the D&C Act would

      not be barred and reads as follows:
87.   In P. Ramanatha Aiyar’s Advanced Law Lexicon, the word derogation is

      defined as “the partial repeal or abrogation of a law by a later act that limits

      its scope or impairs its utility and force”. It is also stated that the word

      “derogate” is a term of legislation. “Derogation” is partial and indirect

      abrogation i.e., when a subsequent law reduces the force and application of an

      older law, the character of the subsequent law is technically said to be

      derogatory. Therefore, the express language employed herein which states that

      the
NDPS Act
is not in derogation of the D&C Act leads to the inference that

      the enactment of the
NDPS Act
must not in any way be understood to take away

      the scope of an offence being also made out under the D&C Act. Furthermore,

      it is also stated that the provisions of the
NDPS Act
and its Rules “shall be in

      addition to” the D&C Act or the Rules made thereunder. Therefore, in the

      reverse scenario, i.e., when an offence under the D&C Act is made out or can

      potentially be made out, the accused can also be charged or prosecuted for an
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                     Page 87 of 189
offence under the
NDPS Act
. Any argument to the contrary would be

      untenable. This is so because the
NDPS Act
applies in addition to the provisions

      of the D&C Act. Inevitably, there may arise situations wherein the substance

      in question in a particular case falls under the ambit of both the
NDPS Act
and

      D&C Act. However, the overlap would not necessarily imply that the

      application of the provisions of the
NDPS Act
would be at the cost of exclusion

      of the provisions of D&C Act, or vice versa.
Section 80
of the NDPS Act must

      be understood in the context and object behind the coming into force of these

      two legislations i.e., the
NDPS Act
and D&C Act respectively, and the distinct

      purposes that they seek to achieve.
90. On a conspectus of the foregoing discussion on the scheme of the
NDPS Act
and its rules along with the D&C Act and the rules made thereunder, the

     position of law can be succinctly stated as follows:
iii.   The NDPS Rules, 1985 have been brought into being by the Central

            Government in exercise of the powers under
Sections 9
and
76
of the
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                       Page 93 of 189
NDPS Act
, respectively. The underlying object of the NDPS rules is

           to “permit and regulate” certain activities for carrying out the

           purposes of the
NDPS Act
and not to “prohibit” those activities. The

           NDPS rules must not be understood as laying down standards

           different from or inconsistent with the substantive provisions of the
NDPS Act
, especially
Section 8
and the
Schedule to the NDPS Act
.

     iv.   Chapter VI of the NDPS Rules, inter alia, states that the import into

           and export out of India of all psychotropic substances, including those

           only mentioned under the
Schedule to the Act
, must be accompanied

           by a valid import certificate and export authorisation. However, the

           import and export of substances enumerated in Schedule I of the Rules

           is restricted to a pre-determined set of purposes as explained under

           Chapter VIIA, irrespective of having obtained an import certificate or

           export authorisation under the other rules of this Chapter.

     v.    Chapter VII indicates that the manufacture of all psychotropic

           substances, including those mentioned only under the
Schedule to the

           Act
must be in accordance with the conditions of licence issued under

           the D&C Rules. Despite there being a general rule absolutely

           prohibiting the manufacture, possession, transport, import inter-State,

           export inter-State, sale, purchase, consumption or use of any of the

           psychotropic substances which find mention in Schedule I appended
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                    Page 94 of 189
to the Rules, still the above activities can be done vis-á-vis the

            substances mentioned in Schedule I appended to the Rules, provided

            such activities are in accordance with other provisions of the Chapter

            which generally apply to all psychotropic substances, and for the

            limited purposes mentioned under Chapter VIIA.
vi.    The manufacture of all psychotropic substances mentioned under the
Schedule to the Act
, and those mentioned under Schedule I of the

            Rules (provided they are manufactured only for the purposes

            elaborated under Chapter VIIA), in violation of the conditions of

            licence of manufacture issued under the D&C Act and its rules would

            amount to a contravention of Rule 65 of the NDPS Rules and thereby
Section 8
of the NDPS Act itself. In other words, due to the operation

            of Rule 65, a violation of the condition of licence under the D&C Act

            read with its Rules would ipso facto tantamount to a violation of the
NDPS Act
read with its Rules.
vii.   Furthermore, no person shall possess any psychotropic substance,

            including those mentioned only under the
Schedule to the Act
for any

            of the purposes covered by the D&C Rules, unless he is lawfully

            authorised to possess such substance for any of the said purposes

            under the NDPS rules. Therefore, Schedule I substances can be

            possessed only for the purposes mentioned under Chapter VIIA. All
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                    Page 95 of 189
other substances mentioned only under the
Schedule to the Act
can be

             possessed for the purposes mentioned under Chapter VIIA and also

             for the purposes falling under the broad umbrella of “medical or

             scientific purposes” as mentioned under
Section 8
of the NDPS Act.

             The above is in addition to the fulfilment of the requirements under

             the D&C Rules.
viii.   The underlying idea that resonates throughout the NDPS rules is that

             dealing in any of the psychotropic substances mentioned under

             Schedule I of the NDPS Rules must strictly be in accordance with the

             NDPS Rules AND ONLY for the purposes enumerated under Chapter

             VIIA of the NDPS Rules. The substances not figuring under Schedule

             I of the Rules but listed in the
Schedule to the Act
must also abide by

             the requirements cast upon by the NDPS Rules. The difference as

             regards these substances, however, is that while they may be dealt

             with for the purposes enumerated under Chapter VIIA of the NDPS

             Rules, they can also be dealt with for other “medical and scientific

             purposes”. Whether the accused has dealt with it within the confines

             of the expression “medical or scientific purposes” would be

             determined on the facts and circumstances of each case.
ix.     Therefore, the substances under Schedule I to the Rules are more

             strictly restricted and the remaining psychotropic substances under
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                       Page 96 of 189
the
Schedule to the Act
are more leniently restricted. The different

            levels in restriction could be seen as the primary reason behind

            providing two different schedules, i.e., one under the Act and another

            under the Rules.
xi.    To say that no offence would be made out in a case where an accused

            deals with a substance mentioned only under the
Schedule to the Act
,

            would have the consequence of rendering the entire
Schedule to the

            Act
useless, unnecessary and nugatory.
xii.   Rajesh Kumar Gupta (supra) assumed that the prohibitory power

            could only be traced to Rules 53 and 64 of the NDPS Rules

            respectively, and stated that Rules 53 and 64 of the NDPS Rules

            respectively, were a genus and the other rules following in their
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                    Page 97 of 189
respective Chapters were species thereof. Therefore, since Rules 53

             and 64 respectively, only related to the substances listed under

             Schedule I of the Rules, it was held that the dealing in of substances

             not finding a mention in Schedule I of the Rules and only listed under

             the
Schedule to the Act
, would be unregulated by the Rules and thus,

             would not amount to an offence under
Section 8(c)
.
xiii.   On the other hand, Sanjeev V. Deshpande (supra) overruled Rajesh

             Kumar Gupta (supra) by explaining that it is
Section 8(c)
of the

             NDPS Act which prohibits various activities with respect to

             psychotropic substances and the source of this prohibitory power

             cannot be attributed to Rules 53 and 64 respectively. Rules 53 and 64

             are in the nature of an exception to the general scheme of the NDPS

             Rules. While Rules 53 and 64 state that the substances under Schedule

             I of the Rules cannot be dealt with in any manner, the other substances

             i.e., those mentioned under the
Schedule to the Act
, are also regulated

             under the other rules in the respective Chapters of the NDPS Rules.

     xiv.    However, what we understand as also being the essence of the scheme

             of the NDPS Rules is that, it does not absolutely prohibit the dealing

             in of the substances mentioned under Schedule I of the Rules as held

             in Sanjeev V. Deshpande (supra). These substances figuring in

             Schedule I of the Rules can also be dealt with but only for the limited
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                      Page 98 of 189
purposes mentioned under Chapter VIIA of the NDPS Rules. This is

           evident from the re-phrasing of the NDPS Rules which was effected

           on 25.03.2015, which according to us, has not changed the meaning

           of the Rules but only altered its language.
xv.
Section 80
states that the provisions of the
NDPS Act
or the Rules

           made thereunder shall be in addition to, and not in derogation of the

           D&C Act and the Rules made thereunder. Therefore, when an offence

           under the D&C Act is made out or can potentially be made out, the

           accused can also be charged or prosecuted for an offence under the
NDPS Act
or vice-versa. The object sought to be achieved under both

           the legislations is also distinct i.e. the
NDPS Act
is a special law

           enacted to regulate the operations relating to narcotic drugs and

           psychotropic substances with a view to curb and penalise the usage of

           drugs by persons for intoxication etc., whereas the D&C Act was

           enacted to prevent substandard, adulterated and spurious drugs from

           entering the medical market and to maintain high standards in medical

           treatment. Hence, offences under both the enactments can also be said

           to have been constituted simultaneously, where the circumstances so

           require.
91.   The declaration of a statute dealing with substantive rights, by the legislature,

      is considered to be prospective unless it is expressly or by necessary implication

      made to have retrospective operation. The legal maxim “Nova Constitutio

      Futuris Forman Imponere Debet, Non Praeteritis” indicating that a new law

      ought to regulate what is to follow and not the past, carries with it a presumption

      of prospectivity and this presumption is generally said to operate unless the

      contrary is shown by an express provision in the statute or if the retrospectivity

      is otherwise discernible through necessary implication. This is because such

      statutes would have the consequence of affecting vested rights, impose new

      burdens or impair existing obligations. However, when a decision rendering an

      opinion as regards the interpretation of a penal provision is subsequently

      overruled by the decision of a larger bench, the consequence of the overruling

      is starkly different and by default, retrospective. This is because it is settled law

      that the law declared by this Court is retrospective and is normally assumed to

      be the law from the inception.
Prospective operation is only exception to this normal rule. [...]”

                                                      (Emphasis supplied)
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                      Page 107 of 189
125. Salmond, in his acclaimed work on jurisprudence, is of the opinion that a judge

     does not make law and merely declares it. According to him, when a particular

     decision is overruled, it is declared that the supposed rule laid down in such an

     overruled decision was never the right law. Since, it’s authoritative value is

     erased completely, any intermediate transaction, despite being made on the

     strength of that supposed rule, would be governed by the principles established

     in the overruling decision.
128. It is obvious that, in the factual circumstances before us, especially in matters

     of a criminal nature, the essence of the decision laid down in Rajesh Kumar

     Gupta (supra) could not be considered to have been separately embraced in
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                     Page 153 of 189
any contract, both express or implied. On the contrary, it is the legislative

     authority of the
NDPS Act
, more particularly
Section 8
of the NDPS Act, which

     would have the final say on whether an offence is made out or not or govern

     the facts which the accused persons have subjected themselves to. When the

     very legal interpretation given to
Section 8
of the NDPS Act could be said to

     have been wrong and misplaced in the overruled decision, it naturally follows

     that no vested right, whatsoever, could have accrued or be said to have existed

     independently of the statute, to such persons accused of a committing an

     offence under
Section 8
. More so, when the decision in Rajesh Kumar Gupta

     (supra) was an outlier on the issue when compared to several decisions that

     came prior to it.
and any such investigation, legal proceeding or
                  remedy may be instituted, continued or enforced, and
                  any such penalty, forfeiture or punishment may be
                  imposed as if the repealing Act or Regulation had not
                  been passed.”

              A plain reading of the above provision indicates that the repeal
              of an enactment shall not affect previous operation, unless a
              different intention appears. It may be appropriately noted here
              that the present case does not involve repeal or revival of any
              enactment but is a case where a Constitution Bench of this
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                    Page 162 of 189
Court has declared a statutory provision as invalid and
              unconstitutional being hit by
Article 14
of the Constitution. As
              such
Section 6
of the 1897 Act will have no application.”

                                                    (Emphasis supplied)
135. Moreover, consider a situation wherein a certain statute or provision is declared

     to be unconstitutional by this Court for being violative of
Article 14
of the

     Constitution but with prospective effect. Can it be argued that the actions

     undertaken on the basis of that unconstitutional provision or legislation, until

     the date of the judgment, would be open to being challenged for also being
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                     Page 165 of 189
violative of
Article 14?
This would necessarily be answered in the negative

     because the Court consciously declares prospectivity after weighing and

     balancing all interests and practical realities. No individual can claim the

     benefit of the decision declaring a provision as unconstitutional for transactions

     or events which occurred prior to that decision if the intention to give

     prospective effect to the decision is plain and direct. No doubt, the actions

     wrongly taken in the past would not be automatically validated but on a balance

     of equities, a challenge to those actions are also disallowed. Similarly, while a

     decision is being overruled and the default rule of retrospectivity in matters of

     overruling is applied, it would not be permissible for anyone to contend that

     any right accrued to them on the basis of the judgement which declared the

     wrong proposition of law. Therefore, the retrospective overruling of the

     decision in Rajesh Kumar Gupta (supra) cannot be faulted with for being

     possibly hit by
Article 20(1)
of the Constitution. It would not be open for an

     accused to contend that any right accrued to them on the basis of the judgement

     in Rajesh Kumar Gupta (supra). However, with a view to do complete justice

     to the issue at hand, we declare that matters in which the trial has already

     concluded on the basis of the incorrect exposition of law and have attained

     finality, would not be disturbed. It would be tedious endeavour for all those

     acquittals to be re-opened and re-tried again.
Having said so, any and all
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                     Page 166 of 189
pending matters would be adjudged on the basis of the correct interpretation of

     law as declared in
Sanjeev V Deshpande
(supra).
it was reiterated that it was only the conviction or sentence for any offence

     under an ex-post facto law that is prohibited under
Article 20(1).
The overruling

     of a decision cannot be equated to the enactment of an ex-post facto law,

     especially when the interpretation given to the statute/provision in the

     overruling decision is not a novel and unreasonably expansive interpretation of

     the provision in question such that it was completely unforseeable. An ex-post

     facto law lays down a new or completely alternate legal position from what

     existed before. The same is not the effect of an overruling decision which only

     interprets the intention which always remained with the legislature while

     enacting the concerned provision. The indiscriminate dealing in of substances

     which are only mentioned under the
Schedule to the Act
cannot be said to have

     been indubitably legal and allowed by the legislation prior to the decision in
Sanjeev V Deshpande
(supra).
141. One another question of law which has sprung up in the facts of our case is

       whether, after the charges are framed by the Trial Court, an accused could be

       discharged or his charges could be deleted through an application made under
Section 216
of the CrPC.
143. Under this provision, any Court is empowered to “alter” or “add” to any charge

     framed against the accused, at any time before the judgment is pronounced.

     Therefore, an outer time limit is set i.e. the power conferred upon the Courts

     cannot be exercised after a decision is pronounced in the matter. Although the

     provision does not expressly provide for the stage of the trial after which the

     power under
Section 216
CrPC can be exercised, yet logic and rationale

     obviously requires it to be exercised after a charge has been framed by the Trial

     Court under
Section 228
CrPC. For if no charge has been framed, there arises

     no occasion to add or alter it. As a natural corollary, if an accused has already

     been discharged under
Section 227
CrPC, no application or action under
Section 216
CrPC would be maintainable.
150. However, if careful attention is paid to the orders of the Special Judge in both

     the appeals, it cannot be said that they have exercised their power under Section

     216 to “alter” the charge of the accused persons. We say so because, the charge

     which existed under
Sections 8
,
22
and
29
of the NDPS Act in Criminal Appeal

     No. 1319 of 2013 and under
Sections 8
and
22
of the NDPS Act in Criminal

     Appeal No. 272 of 2014 respectively were not varied and a different charge

     under a specific provision of the D&C Act was not made. In such a

     circumstance, in effect, the Special Judge had discharged or deleted the charge

     of the accused persons under the
NDPS Act
in both the appeals.
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                    Page 179 of 189
b.    Whether charges could be deleted or the accused be discharged under
Section 216
CrPC.
151.
Section 216
CrPC provides the Court with the power to do two things – One,

     alter a charge and two, add to a charge. Nowhere, does the provision expressly

     or by necessary implication lead to an inference that a charge could be deleted

     altogether. No doubt, the Court is given an expansive and wide-ranging power.

     However, that must not mean that the powers conferred are without any limits.
156. It cannot be said that the dealing in of “Buprenorphine Hydrochloride” would

     not amount to an offence under
Section 8
of the NDPS Act owing to the fact

     that the said psychotropic substance only finds mention under the
Schedule to

     the NDPS Act
and is not listed under Schedule I of the NDPS Rules. There

     exists nothing to indicate that Rules 53 and 64 of the NDPS Rules respectively,

     are the governing rules in their respective Chapters, more so, when the language
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                   Page 185 of 189
of the other rules in Chapters VI and VII respectively, are clear about their

     application to the substances mentioned under the
Schedule to the Act
as well.
157. All the psychotropic substances mentioned under the
Schedule to the Act
have

     potential grave and harmful consequences to the individual and the society at

     large, when abused. Some psychotropic substances mentioned under the
Schedule to the NDPS Act
are also mentioned under the D&C Act and the rules

     framed thereunder. This is only because those substances while capable of

     being abused for their inherent properties could also be used in the field of

     medicine. However, the mere mention of certain psychotropic substances under

     the D&C regime would not take them away from the purview of the
NDPS Act
,

     if they are also mentioned under the
Schedule to the NDPS Act
.
159. Furthermore, the retrospective application of the dictum in Sanjeev V.

     Deshpande (supra) would not give rise to any implications as regards the rights

     of the accused persons under
Article 20(1)
of the Constitution. This is because

     while overruling the decision in Rajesh Kumar Gupta (supra), the decision in

     Sanjeev V. Deshpande (supra) has only clarified the law as it stood from its

     inception and given true effect to the meaning assigned to the relevant

     provisions of the
NDPS Act
and the Rules thereunder, by the lawmakers. The

     same cannot be construed as creating a new offence. Additionally, the

     overruling of a decision cannot be equated to the enactment of an ex-post facto

     law, especially when the interpretation given to the statute/provision in the

     overruling decision is not a novel and unreasonably expansive interpretation of
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                    Page 187 of 189
the provision in question such that it was completely unforseeable. It cannot be

     reasonably argued that the indiscriminate dealing in of substances which are

     only mentioned under the
Schedule to the NDPS Act
and absent under Schedule

     I of the NDPS Rules, was indubitably legal and allowed by the legislation, prior

     to the decision in Sanjeev V. Deshpande (supra). Therefore, there remains no

     doubt in our minds that giving retrospective effect to the decision in Sanjeev

     V. Deshpande (supra) would be necessary considering the facts and

     circumstances in the background of which we are called upon to adjudicate

     these matters13.   The appellant had preferred a petition for Special Leave to Appeal against both

      the orders of the High Court granting bail to the respondents. Vide order dated

      31.03.2006, this Court declined to interfere with the grant of bail, however,

      made it clear that the observations of the High Court that Buprenorphine

      Hydrochloride would not be covered under the
NDPS Act
and that no offence

      under the
NDPS Act
and its rules was made out, would not have any persuasive

      effect when the matter would be finally considered before the Special Judge on

      merits.
38. Having heard the learned counsel appearing for the parties and having gone

     through the materials on record, the following questions fall for our

     consideration:
43.   The Preamble to the Convention on Psychotropic Substances, 1971

      (hereinafter, the “Convention”), elucidates that the Convention was adopted

      keeping in mind the primary concern as regards the health and welfare of

      mankind along with the public health and social problems which arise as a

      result of abuse of certain psychotropic substances. It called for a collective and

      determinative action from all States to prevent and combat the abuse of such

      substances and the rise in illicit trade thereof. Rigorous measures were

      considered necessary to restrict the use of psychotropic substances to legitimate

      purposes while simultaneously acknowledging that their use for medical and

      scientific purposes must not be unduly restricted or curtailed. The Convention

      is annexed with four Schedules containing controlled psychotropic substances,
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                       Page 33 of 189
where arguably, Schedule I substances are the most restricted while Schedule

     IV substances are the least restricted.
50.   On a conspectus of the aforementioned Articles of the Convention, it can be

      seen that the substances mentioned in Schedules I, II, III and IV respectively

      are subject to different treatment and restrictions on their manufacture, use,

      possession, import and export, amongst others. While Schedule I substances

      are to be used for limited purposes by the authorized persons under a special

      licence or prior authorization, the substances mentioned under Schedule II, III

      and IV respectively, are used for a comparatively wider range of purposes by

      the licence holders and its supply is allowed to be made pursuant to a medical

      prescription. Therefore, it cannot be stated that the substances other than the

      Schedule I substances are completely unregulated or allowed to be dealt with

      in any manner whatsoever. These substances also have the potential to be
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                    Page 39 of 189
misused or abused and hence are subject to certain restrictions and procedural

      requirements albeit not up to the standards as strict as the Schedule I substances.
55. It is just not enough to prove or establish that the narcotic drug or psychotropic

     substance is capable of being used for a medical or scientific purpose. That

     would give unnecessary leeway to persons to indiscriminately deal with

     narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances under the garb that they could also

     be potentially used for medical or scientific purposes. Moreover, several of

     these drugs and substances are inherently of such a nature that they have

     widespread medicinal and scientific applications. Therefore, an expansive

     interpretation of the exception that the mere potential for usage of the narcotic

     drug or psychotropic substance ,for medical or scientific purpose, is sufficient

     would run counter to the object of the Act which seeks to act as a deterrent to

     the widespread dealing in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances. What

     must, therefore, be proved to take the benefit of the exception is that the

     narcotic drug or psychotropic substances was being dealt in for a specified and

     real medical or scientific purpose, in the manner and to the extent provided by

     the provisions of the Act, the rules and orders made thereunder and, in case

     such provisions imposes any requirement by way of licence, permit or

     authorisation, in accordance with the terms and conditions of such licence,

     permit or authorisation.
15. In light of the above observations, we find that the decision
              rendered by the High Court holding that the respondent-
92. The operation of a newly enacted statute or rule must not be confused with the

     effect of a judgment. A judgement or decision which interprets a statute or

     provision thereof declares the meaning of the statute as it should be construed

     from the date of its enactment. In other words, the judgment declares what the

     legislature had said at the time when the law was promulgated and therefore, it

     has retrospective effect. On the contrary, it is the statute or the rule which is

     presumed to be prospective unless expressly made retrospective. What follows

     from the same, is that a decision or judgment enunciating a principle of law is

     applicable to all cases irrespective of the stage of pendency before different

     forums since what has been enunciated is the meaning of the law which existed

     from the inception of the concerned statute or provision. What has been

     declared to be the law of the land must be held to have always been the law of

     the land. This conclusion also stems from the rationale that the duty of the court

     is not to “pronounce a new law but to maintain and expound the old one”. The

     judge rather than being the creator of the law, is only its discoverer.
25. In service matters, this Court on a number of occasions have
            passed orders on equitable consideration. But the same would not
            mean that whenever a law is declared, it will have an effect only
            because it has taken a different view from the earlier one. In those
            cases it is categorically stated that it would have prospective
            operation.
44. The need to make the law
laid down in
Mohd. Ramzan Khan
case [(1991) 1 SCC 588 : 1991 SCC (L&S) 612 : (1991) 16 ATC
           505] prospective in operation requires no emphasis. As pointed
           out above, in view of the unsettled position of the law on the
           subject, the authorities/managements all over the country had
           proceeded on the basis that there was no need to furnish a copy of
           the report of the enquiry officer to the delinquent employee and
           innumerable employees have been punished without giving them
           the copies of the reports. In some of the cases, the orders of
           punishment have long since become final while other cases are
           pending in courts at different stages. In many of the cases, the
           misconduct has been grave and in others the denial on the part of
           the management to furnish the report would ultimately prove to be
           no more than a technical mistake. To reopen all the disciplinary
           proceedings now would result in grave prejudice to administration
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                  Page 123 of 189
which will far outweigh the benefit to the employees concerned.
114. Another pertinent question for the purpose of our discussion would be, whether

     the prospective operation of a particular decision delivered in the past can be

     decided subsequently by a different bench, which is concerned with the same

     question of law, especially when the previous decision is silent on the question

     of prospectivity or retrospectivity. There has been some debate as to whether

     this would amount to a review of
the said decision
under a non-review

     jurisdiction.
118. As repeatedly discussed in the aforesaid parts of this judgment, the doctrine of

     prospective overruling was designed to prevent the unravelling of past

     transactions and the re-opening of matters which have already attained finality.

     In so far as the applicability of the doctrine or a rationale similar to it, to matters

     pertaining to criminal law are concerned, this Court has in the past held that

     acquittals granted on the basis of the earlier position/interpretation of law must

     not be interfered with.
124.
Article 20(1)
of the Constitution of India reads that – “No person shall be

     convicted of any offence except for violation of a law in force at the time of the

     commission of the act charged as an offence, nor be subjected to a penalty
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                      Page 149 of 189
greater than that which might have been inflicted under the law in force at the

     time of the commission of the offence.”. It is therefore, set in stone under the

     constitutional principles of our legal system that it would be absolutely

     impermissible for an accused to be convicted of an offence under any Act, if

     his act was not an offence at the time during which it was committed. Herein,

     the import of the words “law in force at the time of the commission” is

     especially important. It has been detailed by us, with sufficient clarity, in the

     preceding paragraphs, that judges do not make law but only find the right law.

     This is precisely the reason behind retrospectively applying any overruling

     decision as a default rule. However, can the overruling judgment and its

     declaration of law be considered to be the “law in force at the time of the

     commission”? Such a question is required to be considered by us more

     particularly as regards matters which pertain to substantive law, like the present

     one. Herein, the controversy is whether the dealing in of psychotropic

     substances which are mentioned under the
Schedule to the NDPS Act
and not

     under Schedule I of the NDPS Rules would constitute an offence or not. While

     the decision in Rajesh Kumar Gupta (supra) answered in the negative, the

     subsequent decision in Sanjeev V. Deshpande (supra) answered affirmatively

     and overruled the decision in Rajesh Kumar Gupta (supra). Following the

     general rule, the exposition of law in Sanjeev V. Deshpande (supra) is required

     to be considered as the right position of law from its inception. However, we
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                     Page 150 of 189
have to examine whether holding so would result in any implications on the

     fundamental rights of the accused, in the specific facts and attendant

     circumstances that accompany the present appeals.
134. The Blackstonian theory also lends great support to our conclusion since it

     underscores the principle that it is not the function of the court to pronounce a

     “new rule” but to maintain and expound the “old one”. Therefore, the

     overruling of a decision cannot be equated to the creation of a new law. The

     correct principle of law is merely clarified and applied retrospectively.

     Therefore, in the circumstances of the instant case, it cannot be said that a new

     offence was “created” subsequently. It is to be considered as always have

     existed. The offence under
Section 8
as expounded in
Sanjeev V Deshpande
(supra) was not introduced out of thin air and it cannot be said that its existence

     as construed in the aforesaid decision was undeniably absent from the scheme

     of the provisions under the
NDPS Act
. We have elaborated with sufficient

     detail, by even exhaustively and conscientiously discussing the Articles of the

     Convention of Psychotropic Substances, 1971 which motivated the enactment

     of the
NDPS Act
along with the object of the
NDPS Act
and concluding that it

     would be a grave error to assume that the law was ever otherwise.
137. We find it necessary to reiterate that acquittals which have already been

     recorded and have attained finality would not be unsettled in light of the

     overruling decision or the observations made by us. If it were a reverse scenario

     i.e., if the decision in Rajesh Kumar Gupta (supra) led to the conviction of

     several accused and then subsequently, the effect of the ratio in Sanjeev V.

     Deshpande (supra) was such that those accused were to be acquitted because
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                    Page 168 of 189
an offence was not made, we would have, without an iota of doubt leaned in

     favour of those matters being reconsidered and the convictions also being re-

     examined in light of the clarification given in the subsequent decision.

     However, presently, the situation not being such, we do not wish to subject any

     accused who has been acquitted, to trial again.
154. We are in agreement with the view that once charges have been framed by the

     Trial Court in exercise of the powers under
Section 228
CrPC, the accused

     cannot thereafter be discharged, be it through an exercise of the powers under

     Sections 227 or 216
CrPC
. It is reiterated that the language of
Section 216
CrPC

     provides only for the addition and alteration of charge(s) and not for the

     deletion or discharge of an accused. If the Legislature had intended to empower

     the Trial Court with the power to delete a charge at that stage, the same would

     have been expressly and unambiguously stated. Therefore, at such a stage of

     the trial, the accused must necessarily either be convicted or acquitted of the

     charges that were so framed against him. No shortcuts must be allowed.
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                   Page 184 of 189
155. In both the appeals before us i.e. Criminal Appeal Nos. 1319 of 2013 and 272

     of 2014 respectively, the Trial Courts vide their orders dated 30.11.2006 and

     17.04.2010 have in effect deleted the charge framed for the offence under the

     provisions of the
NDPS Act
and then transferred the file to the Court of the

     Metropolitan Magistrate for proceeding in accordance with the provisions of

     the D&C Act, without arriving at a decision to acquit the accused as regards

     the charges already framed under the provisions of the
NDPS Act
. The same is

     impermissible under the scheme of our criminal procedure code and both the

     Trial Courts could be said to have committed a grave error while reaching the

     conclusion that as the offences were not triable by them, the case should be

     transferred to the court of the Metropolitan Magistrate respectively.In these circumstances it would be appropriate if the application
          under
Section 216
of the Code of Criminal Procedure which has
          been filed by the petitioner is disposed of taking into account, inter
          alia
,
the said decision
of this Court. While disposing of the
          application under
Section 216
Code of Criminal Procedure, the
          learned Sessions Courts shall not be influenced by what has been
          held in the impugned order and shall consider the entire issue
          afresh. The Learned Sessions Court shall decide the application
          under
Section 216
Code of Criminal Procedure first before
          proceeding further with the matter. It is, of course, goes without
          saying that not only the counsel for the petitioner but the counsel
          for the State shall also be heard on all submissions. In view of
          above, terms this revision petition stands disposed of.”

                                                     (Emphasis supplied)
16. In view of the foregoing discussion, the Petition is devoid of
           any merit; the same is accordingly dismissed.
5. The prospective declaration of law is a devise innovated by the
           Apex Court to avoid reopening of settled issues and to prevent
           multiplicity of proceedings. It is also a devise adopted to avoid
           uncertainty and avoidable litigation. By the very object of
           prospective declaration of law, it is deemed that all actions taken
           contrary to the declaration of law prior to its date of declaration
           are validated. This is done in the larger public interest.
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                     Page 110 of 189
Therefore, the subordinate forums which are legally bound to
           apply the declaration of law made by this Court are also duty-
           bound to apply such dictum to cases which would arise in future
           only. In matters where decisions opposed to the said principle
           have been taken prior to such declaration of law cannot be
           interfered with on the basis of such declaration of law. In the
           instant case, both decisions of the DPC as well as the appointing
           authority being prior to the judgment in Sabharwal case [(1995)
           2 SCC 745 : 1995 SCC (L&S) 548 : (1995) 29 ATC 481] we are
           of the opinion that the Tribunal was in error in applying this
           decision. For this reason, these appeals succeed and are hereby
           allowed; setting aside the orders and directions made by the
           Tribunal in OAs Nos. 186 of 1994 and 961 of 1995.”

                                                    (Emphasis supplied)
Both administrative reality and public interests do not, therefore,
           require that the orders of punishment passed prior to the decision
           in

case [(1991) 1 SCC 588 : 1991 SCC
           (L&S) 612 : (1991) 16 ATC 505] without furnishing the report of
           the enquiry officer should be disturbed and the disciplinary
           proceedings which gave rise to the said orders should be reopened
           on that account. Hence we hold as above.”

19. For the reasons stated above, we dispose of these appeals by
           merely laying down the correct proposition of law but do not make
           any consequential orders setting aside the acquittal of any of the
           respondents or sending back the cases to the courts below or
           convicting any of them by an order of this Court.”

Similarly, under
Section 16(1)(a)(i)
any person who sells
           adulterated food commits an offence and is punishable therein.
           The sugar which is the commodity before us is food under
Section
           2(3)
of the Act. We have already pointed out that sugar by itself is
           an article used as food or at any rate it is an article which
           ordinarily enters into or is used in the composition or preparation
           of human food. In this case the sale was for analysis and the article
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                     Page 170 of 189
was an article of food and in view of the concurrent findings of
           both the courts that it was adulterated, the respondents have
           contravened
Sections 16(1)(a)(i)
of the Act. Hence it must be held
           that the respondents are technically guilty of the offence with
           which they were charged and they have been wrongly acquitted by
           the High Court and the District Magistrate. But in view of the fact
           that the appellant has argued the appeal only as a test case and
           does not challenge the acquittal of the respondents, we merely set
           aside the order and judgment of the High Court. But we may make
           it clear that apart from holding the respondents technically guilty,
           we are not setting aside the order of acquittal passed in their
           favour.”
                                                    (Emphasis supplied)
140.
In
Cherukattil Gopalan
(supra), this Court did not set aside the order of

     acquittal which was passed in favour of the accused but at the same time,

     streamlined the position of law in that regard and only set aside the order and

     judgment of the High Court.
Along similar lines, while we are refraining from

     directing that the orders of acquittal (if any) passed due to the decision in

     Rajesh Kumar Gupta (supra) be disturbed, in so far as the accused person

     before us are concerned, it would have been appropriate to declare them to be

     technically guilty of the offence under
Section 8
of the NDPS Act, had they

     been acquitted. However, what has been brought out from the facts of the

     appeals before us, is that the accused persons were not acquitted but discharged

     due to the decision in Rajesh Kumar Gupta (supra). Therefore, there arises no

     occasion for us to hold them technically guilty of the offences under the

     provisions of the
NDPS Act
that they were charged with. At this juncture, the
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                   Page 171 of 189
obvious next step would be for the trial qua all the accused before us to be

       commenced in accordance with law.


(1) Any Court may alter or add to any charge at any time before
             judgment is pronounced.
(2) Every such alteration or addition shall be read and explained
             to the accused.
(3) If the alteration or addition to a charge is such that proceeding
             immediately with the trial is not likely, in the opinion of the Court,
             to prejudice the accused in his defence or the prosecutor in the
             conduct of the case, the Court may, in its discretion, after such
             alteration or addition has been made, proceed with the trial as if
             the altered or added charge had been the original charge.

             (4) If the alteration or addition is such that proceeding
             immediately with the trial is likely, in the opinion of the Court, to
             prejudice the accused or the prosecutor as aforesaid, the Court
             may either direct a new trial or adjourn the trial for such period
             as may be necessary.
(5) If the offence stated in the altered or added charge is one for
             the prosecution of which previous sanction is necessary, the case
             shall not be proceeded with until such sanction is obtained, unless
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                       Page 172 of 189
sanction has been already obtained for a prosecution on the same
           facts as those on which the altered or added charge is founded.”

                                                   (Emphasis supplied)



Unfortunately, such applications are being filed in the trial courts
           sometimes in ignorance of law and sometimes deliberately to delay
           the proceedings. Once such applications though untenable are
           filed, the trial courts have no alternative but to decide them, and
           then again such orders would be challenged before the higher
           courts, and the whole criminal trial would get derailed. Suffice it
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                     Page 181 of 189
to say that such practice is highly deplorable, and if followed,
           should be dealt with sternly by the courts.”

                                                   (Emphasis supplied)
E.    CONCLUSION

161. We are, therefore, of the view that both the Trial Court and the High Court

     committed an error in holding that the offence under the provisions of the
NDPS Act
is not made out. The Trial Courts in both the appeals could also not

     have discharged/deleted the charge under the
NDPS Act
framed against the
Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013                                   Page 188 of 189
accused persons while disposing of an application under
Section 216
CrPC.
This is something not permissible within our criminal procedure and the High

     Court unfortunately failed to take notice of this aspect.
162. In view of the law expounded by us, since the accused concerned in both the

     appeals were not acquitted in their respective trials, we direct that they be tried

     by the concerned Special Judge, NDPS, in accordance with law. The Trial

     Courts are directed to proceed with the trial and conclude it expeditiously.
163. With the aforesaid directions, we allow both the appeals filed by the appellants

     and set aside the impugned orders passed by the High Court.
164. We direct the Registry to send one copy each of this judgment to all the High

     Courts.

165. Pending application(s), if any, shall stand disposed of.

Each had ten unlabelled glass ampoules with a water coloured liquid, along with several sheets of printed labels which read as “Buprenorphine Hydrochloride’
Issue: On 25.03.2004, a criminal complaint as regards the offence punishable under. the NDPS Act respectively was filed against the respondents. The respondents applied for bail before the Special Judge and the same was declined. However, the High Court vide a common Judgment and Order dated 11.01.2005 granted bail to the respondent no. 3 along with several others.
Petitioner's Argument: Buprenorphine is a psychotropic substance as per the NDPS Act. The commercial quantity is fixed at 20 gms. The contents of each of the ampoules varied between 0.23 mg and 0.34 mg.
Respondent's Argument: It was submitted that the respondent no. 3 and respondent nos. 1 and 2 were granted bail by the High Court vide its orders dated 11.01.2005 and 22.08.2005 respectively. The High Court observed that Buprenorphine Hydrochloride is beyond the pale of Chapter VII of the NDPS Rules. The appellant filed a Special Leave Petition against both the orders granting bail to the respondents.
Precedent Analysis: The High Court dismissed the revision petition. The matter was accordingly remitted to the Metropolitan Magistrate.
Analysis of the law: The High Court wrongly held that the psychotropic substance in the present case is governed exclusively by the D&C Act without attracting an offence under the NDPS Act.
Court's Reasoning: The appellant had preferred a petition for Special Leave to Appeal against both the orders of the High Court granting bail to the respondents. Vide order dated 31.03.2006, this Court declined to interfere with the grant of bail. The Court made it clear that the observations of the. High Court that Buprenorphine and Hydrochloride would not be covered under the.NDPS Act would not have any persuasive effect when the matter would be finally considered before the Special Judge on the merits.
Conclusion: Petition under Section 216 of the Code of Criminal Procedure is disposed of. The Learned Sessions Court will now consider the entire issue afresh.","Fact: The Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (HQ) has seized 40,000 unlabelled glass ampoules containing Buprenorphine which is a substance listed in the Schedule to the NDPS Act.
Issue: The Delhi High Court has held that the Special Court for NDPS cases, New Delhi, should have granted bail to the respondents.
Petitioner's Argument: The appellant, M/s Win Drugs Ltd., filed an appeal against the order of the Special Court, Delhi, vide its order dated 03.02.2005, disposing of the petition of M/s Win Drugs Ltd.
Respondent's Argument: The Punjab and Haryana High Court has dismissed a Special Leave Petition against the orders of the High Court which had granted bail to the accused under the NDPS Act.
Precedent Analysis: The appellant was charged under Section 8 of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act and discharged under Section 216 CrPC by the Special Judge, Delhi.
Analysis of the law: The High Court held that the psychotropic substance in the present case is governed exclusively by the D&C Act without attracting an offence under the NDPS Act.
Court's Reasoning: The appellant has moved this Court against the order of the High Court granting bail to the respondents in the case of possession of Buprenorphine.
Conclusion: Here is the text of the order issued by the Jammu and Kashmir High Court on a revision petition against the order of the Sessions Court, Srinagar:","Fact: officers recovered 25 corrugated card board cartons which contained ten unlabelled glass ampoules with a water coloured liquid . they also recovered a labelled ampoule containing the same liquid from the table drawer of the respondent no. 1 . 40,000 unlabelled ampoule containing a substance listed in the Schedule to the NDPS Act were recovered . since the . respondent was unable to provide any permission or licence for the possession of the recovered glass ampules, they were seized
Issue: a criminal complaint as regards the offence punishable under Sections 22 and 29 of the NDPS Act respectively was filed against the respondents . the respondents applied for bail before the Special Judge and the same was declined . however, the High Court vide a common Judgment and Order dated 11.01.2005 granted bail to the respondent no. 3 along with several others .
Petitioner's Argument: chemical examination revealed that the samples were of Buprenorphine . it is a psychotropic substance under the NDPS Act . the contents of each ampoule varied between 0.23 mg to 0.34 mg .
Respondent's Argument: the respondent no. 3 and respondent nos. 1 and 2 were granted bail by the High Court . but the court had observed that the accused cannot be punished under Sections 22 and 29 . the appellant filed a special leave petition against both the orders granting bail .
Precedent Analysis: the appellant preferred Criminal Revision Petition No. 494 of 2007 . the High Court followed the rationale adopted by this Court in State Criminal Appeal No. 1319 of 2013 .
Analysis of the law: the high court wrongly held that the psychotropic substance in the present case is governed exclusively by the D&C Act without attracting an offence under the NDPS Act .
Court's Reasoning: the appellant had preferred a petition for Special Leave to Appeal . the court declined to interfere with the grant of bail .
Conclusion: petitioner filed application under Section 216 of the Code of Criminal Procedure . learned Sessions Courts shall not be influenced by what has been held in the impugned order ."

                                                 2 of 75
     by the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal [hereinafter

     referred to as ‘NCLAT’] in appeals, pertaining to the Corporate

     Insolvency Resolution Process of the Hindustan National Glass

     and   Industries   Ltd.    [hereinafter    referred   to    as   ‘HNGIL’].

     Additionally, there is a set of appeals arising out of the NCLAT

     Order dated 28.07.2023, pertaining to the approval accorded to

     the combination between HNGIL and AGI Greenpac. In this

     common judgment, the parties are identified from Civil Appeal No.

     6071 of 2023.
7.   Subsequently, in response to an e-mail by the Appellant seeking

     clarification with respect to the timeline for obtaining approval of

     CCI, the RP in an e-mail communication dated 25.08.2022,

     granted   relaxation to Resolution Applicants, to procure CCI

     approval, after CoC’s approval of the Resolution Plan but prior to

     filing the application before NCLT.
8.   On 27.09.2022, AGI Greenpac submitted an application with the

     CCI under Form I under
Regulation 5(ii)
of the Competition

     Commission of India (Procedure in Regard to Transaction of

     Business relating to Combination) Regulations 2011 intimating

     that it proposed to enter into a combination with HNGIL, by



                                 5 of 75
     acquiring 100% of HNGIL’s shareholding and business.
11. However, on 28.10.2022, the CoC approved the AGI Greenpac’s

     Resolution Plan with 98% votes, while Appellant INSCO’s



                                 6 of 75
     Resolution Plan, received 88% votes.
12. Thereafter, on 03.11.2022, AGI Greenpac submitted a detailed

     application (Combination Registration No. C-2022/11/983) under

     Form II seeking approval before CCI. At the same time, the

     Resolution Professional filed an IA under Section 30(6) of the IBC

     Resolution Plan while INSCO filed an IA before NCLT Kolkata

     challenging the approval granted to AGI Greenpac’s Resolution

     Plan, by the COC.
16. Meanwhile, the Appellant INSCO challenged the CCI approval

     dated 15.03.2023 vide Competition Appeal (AT) No. 7/2023 before

     the NCLAT, which upheld the approval vide judgement dated

     28.07.2023.

                    Objections on Locus Standi
28.     In these matters, the principal issue is whether the approval of a

        approval of the Resolution Plan, by the CoC, as stipulated under

109. The question of obtaining approval from the CCI did not arise
in that

       case
, as the acquisition in question, did not qualify as a

       ‘combination’ under the
Competition Act, 2002
. Consequently, the

       legal principles concerning the necessity of CCI approval and the

       implications of such approval, particularly in cases involving the

       possibility of an AAEC, were not addressed or analysed in that

       decision. This was challenged before a two-Judge Bench of this

       Court which found no reason to interfere and dismissed the Appeal

       at the threshold, vide Order dated 06.08.2021.
Procedural Lapses under the Competition Act
1.    The captioned appeals arise from the common order Dt. 18.09.2023 of

the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal, Principal Bench, New Delhi

(“NCLAT”) under
section 62
of the IBC read with the
Insolvency and Bankruptcy

Amendment Act, 2018
. Civil Appeal No.4924 of 2023 and connected appeals

arise from the order Dt. 28.07.2023 of the NCLAT, and the controversy in these

appeals arises under the
Competition Act, 2002
(“
Competition Act
”).
2.    The two sets of appeals have been tagged and heard together. The

appeals, for convenience, are disposed of by separate judgments having regard

to the nature of issues of fact and law.","2.   One key party in this matter is HNGIL i.e., the Corporate

     Debtor/Target Company with a 60% market share of the glass

     packaging   industry      in   India.    The   Resolution    Professional

     represents them. Incorporated in 1946, HNGIL has manufacturing

     plants located in Bahadurgarh (Haryana), Rishra (West Bengal),

     Neemrana (Rajasthan), Naidupeta (Andhra Pradesh), Sinnar

     (Maharashtra), Puducherry and Rishikesh (Uttarakhand), catering

     to a wide range of industries, including pharmaceutical and

     wellness, cosmetics, food & beverage, and alco-beverages, etc.
10. Immediately thereafter, the Appellant objected to the approval

     accorded to AGI Greenpac’s Resolution Plan stating that they had

     not obtained the requisite CCI approval at the time, when their

     Resolution Plan had been put to vote, which had been the

     condition precedent. The Appellant also pointed out that Form I

     submitted by AGI Greenpac with the CCI had been rejected on

     22.10.2022 and that a fresh Form II had been submitted which

     had not yet been approved till the date of the COC approval.

     Further, serious contradictions between the process undertaken

     and the process envisaged to be undertaken by the RP in an e-mail

     clarification dated 25.08.2022, were also highlighted to point out

     that preferential treatment had been granted to AGI Greenpac

     despite the rejection of their Form I, by the CCI.
21.    For the Successful Resolution Applicant i.e., AGI Greenpac Ltd.,

      Mr. Mukul Rohatgi, learned Senior Advocate, inter alia, made the

      following submissions:
26.   Once the CIRP is initiated, the nature of proceedings are no longer

      in personam but rather become in rem. In light of the same, the



                                16 of 75
        expression ‘any person aggrieved’ in the context of the IBC has

        been held to be indicative of there being no rigid locus

        requirements to institute an appeal challenging an order of the

        NCLT before the NCLAT or an order of the NCLAT before this

        Court.1 Similarly, in the context of the
Competition Act
, even

        those persons that bring to CCI information of practices that are

        contrary to the provisions of the
Competition Act
, could be said

        to be ‘aggrieved’.2 Therefore, the term ‘any person aggrieved’

        appearing in
Section 62
of the IBC and
Section 53T
of the

        Competition Act must be understood widely and not in a

        restricted fashion.
27.     In the present case, the Appellant as an unsuccessful resolution

        applicant whose Resolution Plan could have otherwise been

        approved by the CoC, satisfies the requirement of being aggrieved.

        This preliminary locus standi objection vis-à-vis the Appellant,

        therefore, does not merit acceptance.
29.   In its impugned order dated 18.09.2023, the NCLAT concluded

      that while the approval of the CCI for the combination is

      mandatorily required in consonance with the proviso to
Section

      31 (4)
of the IBC, the timing of such approval i.e., that it must be

      obtained prior to the approval of the Resolution Plan by the COC,

      should be construed as being ‘directory’ in nature, rather than

      ‘mandatory’.
38.   The principle of casus omissus, as articulated by this Court in
Ebix

      Singapore (P) Ltd. v. Educomp Solutions Ltd. (CoC
)5, underscoring

      boundaries of judicial interpretation, cautions the courts against

      transgressing into the legislative domain. The courts should not

      arrogate the legislature’s role by filling gaps in statutory text.

      Statutory enactments like the IBC demand strict adherence to

      legislative intent, guarding against procedural overreach that may

      upset the framework envisioned by the Parliament.
39.   Likewise, the Supreme Court in multiple cases had underscored the

      rule that when the language of a statute is plain and unambiguous

      and reasonably susceptible to only one meaning, there cannot be a

      question of construction of the statute, as the provision would speak

      for itself.6
40.   In an oft-quoted case on literal interpretation Kanailal Sur v.
Paramnidhi Sadhu Khan, this Court stated as follows7:
9
Mahalaxmi Mills Ltd., Bhaunagar v. CIT, Bombay
, 1963 SCC OnLine SC 190;
Nasiruddin

 v. State Transport Appellate Tribunal
, (1975) 2 SCC 671; Precision Steel and Engineering
 Works v. Premdeva, (1982) 3 SCC 270.
48.   When the statute is clear and straightforward, the Supreme Court in
Bhavnagar University v. Palitana Sugar Mill Private Limited15
held as

      follows:
49.   Lord Atkinson in Corp. of the City of Victoria v. Bishop of Vancouver

      Island16 observed:
50.   That words in the statute are to be understood in their natural,

      ordinary and popular sense. This has been underscored by Justice

      Frankfurter, in the following opinion:
53.   The legislative intent behind inserting the proviso to
Section 31(4)
of

      the IBC would suggest that prior approval of the CCI was specifically

      mandated and it should not be seen as a flexible provision to be

      ignored in certain exigencies. In fact, a contrary interpretation of the

      said proviso, i.e., that the prior approval is directory, would distort

      the objective for which the legislature inserted the proviso, thereby



  17 Wilma E. Addison v. Holly Hill Fruit Products, 322 US 607.
54.   In the present interpretive exercise, one also needs to be mindful of

      the legal principle which says that where a statute requires one to

      do a certain thing in a certain manner, it must be done in that

      particular manner or not done at all. For this proposition, it would

      be relevant to extract the following from the judgment in
A. R.

      Antulay v. Ramdas Sriniwas Nayak18
:
57.   The learned Solicitor General appearing for the CoC, had suggested

      the interpretation by which the requirement of obtaining prior

      approval from the CCI should be construed as directory. But this

      would inevitably require the Court to interpret the said proviso to

      mean something different than what has been expressly mentioned

      in the proviso. The following decisions of this Court which support

      the present proposition are reproduced for ready reference:
58.   In Sri Venkataramana Devaru v. State of Mysore, the Supreme Court

      held19:
59.
In
Hardeep Singh v. State of Punjab
, this Court held the following20:
60.   Significantly, the Supreme Court in Visitor, Aligarh Muslim

      University v. K.S. Misra21 held:
22 Quebec Railway, Light, Heat & Power Co. v. Vandry, SCC OnLine PC 10; ESI Corpn. v. KEY

 DEE Cold Storage Pvt. Ltd., (2022) 17 SCC 379; UOI v. Hansoli Devi, (2010) 15 SCC 483.
30 of 75
       used by the legislature and should avoid the assumption that the

       legislature by inserting the proviso, using certain words at certain

       places and/or not using particular words at all, committed a

       mistake.
62.   It must be presumed that the legislature inserted every word in a

      provision for a purpose and that every part of the statute should have

      effect as well.23 In that context, in situations wherein there is no

      ambiguity with respect to the provisions of a statute, the Court’s

      interpretative exercise would be restricted. In other words, the Court

      is duty-bound to proceed on the footing that the legislature intended

      what it expressed in the statute (or proviso, in this case). Beyond that,

      the Court’s exercise cannot be stretched to involve a re-writing, re-

      casting or re-framing of the legislation or statute.
63.   In that light, while interpreting
Section 2(2)
of the Arbitration and

      Conciliation Act, 1996, a Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court

      observed that in case the legislature intended to expand the scope of
Part-I of the Act
to arbitrations seated in foreign countries, it would

      have added such words in the provision itself. Therefore, for the

      Court to add words that are not expressly provided by the legislature

      in the statute itself would tantamount to a ‘drastic and unwarranted

Dilawar Balu Kurane v. State of Maharashtra
, (2002).2 SCC 135;
Ramphal Kundu v.
 Kamal Sharma
, (2004) 9 SCC 278.
64.   Rules of interpretation permit courts to read a certain word, term or

      phrase in the statute differently from its plain meaning if it leads to

      absurdity but the courts must always remain conscious of the fine

      dividing line, separating adjudication and legislation, which must

      not be crossed.
In
Vemareddy Kumaraswamy Reddy v. State of A.P.25
,

      the Court in the context held as follows:
65.   In the present case, the use of the word ‘prior’ at the appropriate

      place in the proviso besides being direct, clear and unambiguous

      also does not lead to any absurd consequences. The proviso to
Section 31(4)
of IBC mentions that the approval to the Resolution

      Plan from CCI shall be obtained ‘prior’ to its approval by the CoC.

      vis-à-vis the CCI’s approval. In case of other statutory bodies, a

      timeline of one year subsequent to the CoC’s approval of the

      Resolution Plan was deemed to be sufficient, whereas the timeline

      for procuring the CCI’s approval was brought ahead in the sense

      that the same was required to be obtained prior to the approval of

      the Resolution Plan, by the COC.
37 of 75
                “In the literal sense, then, a “scrivener’s error” is a
                mistake of transcription, which is to say a mismatch
                between original (e.g., spoken word, manuscript) and
                copy. Today, of course, Congress does not use actual
                scriveners. Indeed, the phrase “scrivener’s error” came
                into popular usage only once reliance upon scriveners
                was uncommon. The phrase is thus a term of art, referring
                to a particular sort of legislative mistake. Specifically, and
                as explained more fully throughout Part I, a “scrivener’s
                error” is a case in which the words of a legislative text
                diverge from what Congress meant to say. Such a case
                contrasts with one in which Congress simply should have
                said something else.”
75.   Assuming that there is no such error in the Memorandum and

      therefore the Memorandum presents a conflicting view vis-à-vis the

      Notes on Clauses in explaining the legislative intent behind

      introducing the said proviso, the implication thereof can be

      understood from the following passage from the three Judge Bench

      opinion in a similar context.
In
Shashikant Laxman Kale v. Union of

      India
, the Court opined27 that the final Act would be the guiding

      factor:
76.   Additionally, it is not necessary to refer to Memorandum explaining

      particular clauses of a Bill when the language of the provision is

      clear and unambiguous, as has been held in
ACG Associated

      Capsules v. Commissioner of Income Tax28
. In any case, a

      Memorandum explaining a particular proviso stands at a lower

      footing when compared with Notes on Clauses, explaining the entire

      amendment, especially in cases where the language in the statute

      is definite and straightforward. In fact, the Memorandum does not

      even feature in the Hindi version of the Bill whereas the Notes on

      Clauses elaborately explaining the intent behind introducing each

      amendment, features prominently in both the English and Hindi

      versions. This would also indicate that the Memorandum can never

      play the decisive role.

      approval of the CCI before the approval of the Resolution Plan, by

      the COC. This provision introduced with straightforward and clear

      words must be interpreted and understood as being mandatory in

      nature. Otherwise the object behind the enactment of the said

      proviso, would be defeated.
82.   To decide whether a particular provision should be identified as

      mandatory in nature, we may benefit by referring to the following

      precedents:
83.
In
Sharif-ud-Din v. Abdul Gani Lone
, the Supreme Court held29 as

      follows:
84.   The long-standing principle of the consequence of non-compliance

      being the determinative factor, was later reaffirmed in several

      judgments, such as
Patil Automation Pvt. Ltd. v. Rakheja Engineers

      Pvt. Ltd.30
,
Mackinnon Mackenzie & Co. Ltd. v. Mackinnon Employees
29 (1980) 1 SCC 403.
85.   Earlier, emphasising on the consequence theory to understand the

      binding nature of the statute, Justice K. Subba Rao in his majority

      opinion in
State of U.P. v. Babu Ram Upadhyaya33
, held as follows:
32 (2020) 8 SCC 129.
33 1960 SCC OnLine SC 5.
87.   On the aspect of a possible disharmony between the stipulated

      timeline to be followed under the IBC and the Competition Act, the

      NCLAT in the impugned order has held the proviso to
Section 31(4)
of the IBC, to be directory in nature since mandatory prior approval

      of the CoC, would lead to disruption in the CIRP timeline, as

      stipulated under the IBC.
95.   On the upper limit of 330 days within the CIRP timeline, it has been

      pertinently this Court in
Committee of Creditors of Essar vs. Satish
46 of 75
    Kumar Gupta observed the following34:
Distinguishing cases relied upon by the NCLAT
100. The NCLAT in its analysis placed heavy reliance on the decision of

      the three-judge bench of the NCLAT in Arcelor Mittal India Pvt. Ltd.

      v. Abhijit Guhathakurta35. However, this reliance is misplaced, as the

      factual and legal context of that case materially differs from the

      present matter.
101. For instance, the CIRP in Arcelor commenced prior to the

      introduction of the proviso to
Section 31(4)
of the IBC. The NCLT, in

      Arcelor, explicitly held that the proviso could not be applied

      retrospectively, given that it imposed an additional procedural

      obligation requiring resolution applicants to furnish CCI approval,

      prior to submitting a Resolution Plan. As such, the amendment was

      deemed inapplicable to the CIRP initiated before the enactment of

      the proviso. In contrast, the CIRP in the present case was initiated


  35 2019 SCC OnLine NCLAT 920.
102. In fact, if we look at the impugned NCLAT reasoning it can be noticed

     that the NCLT in Arcelor implicitly mentioned that the clear change

     in procedure i.e., obtaining the prior approval of the CCI, has to be

     implemented prospectively. However, this additional procedural

     obligation cannot be imposed retrospectively in that particular case.
104. Importantly, the Arcelor judgment lacks detailed reasoning or

     analysis by which the NCLAT concluded that the proviso to
Section

     31(4)
is only directory. Further, this judgement was also not

     challenged before this Court. Consequently, its precedential value in

     the present context is limited, and it cannot be relied upon to

     determine the issues arising in this appeal.
106. Further, it does not also discuss the object behind the IBC or the

     introduction of the proviso. In fact, the CCI approval in Makalu does

     not pertain to a situation where a prima facie opinion regarding the

     existence of an AAEC was formed. The absence of such consideration

     underscores the limited relevance of the decision to the present

     matter where, significant issues pertaining to both the IBC and

     Competition law have been raised, requiring a thorough examination

     of the CCI's observations and the implications of its approval.
107. As such, the precedential value of Makalu is insufficient, to support

     the NCLAT findings in the present matter, although Makalu’s

     decision was challenged before this Court and was dismissed vide

     Order dated 12.10.2020, as not involving any substantial question

     of law. However, it is well-settled that the dismissal of an SLP in

     limine without giving any detailed reasons do not constitute any



  36 2020 SCC OnLine NCLAT 643.
108.
Besides, Vishal Vijay Kalantri v. Shailen Shah38
was also relied on by

       the NCLAT, which again is entirely misplaced as the factual and legal

       circumstances
in that case
differ fundamentally from the present

       matter. On the issue of the proviso to
Section 31(4)
of the IBC being

       directory in nature, Vishal Vijay Kalantri merely follows the earlier

       discussed and discarded ratio, in Arcelor Mittal.
110. Therefore, the impugned NCLAT order incorrectly relied upon the

       aforementioned NCLAT decisions. Being distinguishable, those

Employees’ Welfare Association v. Union of India
, (1989) 4 SCC 187; State
  of Orissa v. Dhirendra Sundar Das, (2019) 6 SCC 270.
  38 2020 SCC OnLine NCLAT 1013.
52 of 75
   decisions could not have been unreservedly applied, to the present

   matters. Reliance on those decisions in different context, both on

   facts and on law, would lead to an erroneous interpretation on the

   applicability of the proviso to
Section 31(4)
of the IBC.
116. In any case, it is well-settled that the Resolution Professional does

       not possess any adjudicatory powers under the IBC.39 In fact, the

       role of the Resolution Professional, as a facilitator of the CIPR, is

       almost entirely administrative in nature. Therefore, the Resolution

       Professional, not being an adjudicating authority, could not have

       mandated that the requirement of obtaining prior approval of the

       CCI before placing the Resolution Plan before the NCLT, can be

       relaxed. Granting such relaxation on a whim, oddly enough

       through an e-mail in the present case, was in our opinion beyond



39
Swiss Ribbons Pvt. Ltd. v. Union of India
, (2019) 4 SCC 17.
- a term, denoting premature or unauthorised consummation of a

     transaction, prior to obtaining mandatory approvals from the CCI.
130. A compelling aspect of this statutory scheme is the deliberate use

      of the term ‘investigation’ in
Section 29
, contrasting sharply with

      ‘inquiry’ as employed in Section 26, which pertains to anti-

      competitive agreements and abuse of dominant market position.

party audits or independent verifications, creates loopholes for the

     circumvention of regulatory conditions. For example:
Further, such a conditional approval can foster uncertainty,

       prolong negotiations, and necessitate further modifications,

       thereby putting at peril the sanctity of the resolution framework.41


                                     CONCLUSION
149. Within that context, while the IBC’s primary objective is the timely

       resolution of stressed assets with maximised value realisation for

       the stakeholders, the significant delay seen in the present case is

       both unfortunate and regrettable. Nevertheless, expeditious

       resolution cannot come at the cost of disregarding statutory

II.   BACKGROUND
4.    Annexure B of the expression of interest (“EoI”) lays down the eligibility

criteria for the prospective resolution applicants to satisfy. The relevant criteria

are reproduced below:

B.    PROCEEDINGS BEFORE NCLAT
13.   The order Dt. 28.04.2023 was challenged before the NCLAT by the

following parties, and details are stated thus:
14.   INSCO assails the order of the Adjudicating Authority Dt. 28.04.2023

that the reliance placed on Arcelor Mittal India Pvt. Limited vs. Abhijit

Guhathakurta, Resolution Professional of EPC Constructions India Limited &
8
Ors.1 is erroneous, and according to the ratio in
Bank of Maharashtra vs.

Videocon Industries Ltd.,2
the approval of CCI prior to CoC considering the

resolution plan is mandatory. The words “shall” and “prior to the approval of

such resolution plan by the committee of creditors” in the proviso to
section

31(4)
of the IBC require that the approval of combination is available while the

CoC considers the resolution plans attracting combination set out in
section 5
of the Competition Act.
16.   The NCLAT, by the impugned common order, dismissed the appeals.

16.1. The impugned order in paragraph 19 notices the scope of controversy

      considered and decided by NCLAT as follows:

III.   PROCEEDINGS IN THIS COURT
18.    The civil appeals at the instance of the appellants in the impugned order

are as follows:
22.     Shri Mukul Rohatgi and Shri Paras Tripathi, learned Senior Counsel

have appeared for AGI Greenpac Ltd.

A.      ARGUMENTS ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
23.14.   The Court, while interpreting, shall not legislate or change the law

         which clearly reflects the will of the Parliament. The reliance on
13
Arcelor Mittal (supra) is erroneous and illegal, even if these decisions

            are confirmed by this Court in the Civil Appeal(s).
B.    ARGUMENTS ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
20
24.16.   The RP, CoC and the resolution applicant are bound by the timelines

         stipulated under the IBC. The timely performance of a duty or

         function by CCI is not in the hands of a resolution applicant who

         applied for approval of a combination before CCI. The consideration

         by the CCI depends on products, nature of the industry, area and

         dominance in the market. The CCI, as a regulatory authority, ensures

         fair competition even after a combination is brought into existence.

         For the said purpose, the inquiry under
section 20
of the Competition

         Act is complied with by CCI.
29.   The IBC, thus, seeks to replace the existing framework on insolvency and

bankruptcy, which is enumerated below:
Under this Act, the Board of Industrial and Financial Reconstruction

        assesses the viability of the industrial company and refers an unviable

        company to the High Court for liquidation. SICA 1985 stands repealed.



V.      SCHEME OF INSOLVENCY AND BANKRUPTCY CODE, 2016

aims:

Committee of Creditors of

Essar Steel India Limited Through Authorised Signatory v. Satish Kumar Gupta
and others,3 wherein it was held that the outer limit for the completion of CIRP

was 330 days, which may be extended by the adjudicating authority in

exceptional cases where the delay in litigation could not be attributed to the

parties.

VI.   ANALYSIS
27
39.
In
Madhav Rao Scindia vs. Union of India,4
it has been held that the

simpler and more common the word or expression, the more meanings and

shades of meaning it has. As already noted, apparently clear and simple

language in its comprehensive analysis is so ambiguous at times that it

presents difficulty in understanding its meaning, requirement, and purport.
40.    In Commissioner of Income Tax, Orissa vs. NC Budhraja and Co.,5 it is

held that a statute cannot always be construed with the dictionary in one hand

and the statute in the other. Regard must also be had to the scheme, context,

and legislative history.                                   (emphasis supplied)
41.    In Corp of the City of Victoria vs. Bishop of Vancouver Island,6 the

celebrated judgment, Lord Atkinson stated: “In the construction of statutes,

their words must be interpreted in their ordinary grammatical sense, unless

there be something in the context, or in the object of the statute in which they

occur, or in the circumstances in which they are used, to show that they were

used in a special sense different from their ordinary grammatical sense. The

literal interpretation leads to hardship, inconsistency or obstruct the

accomplishment of the object of the statute steps in. In other words, the

doctrine of purposive interpretation is taken recourse to for the purpose of

giving full effect to the statutory provisions and the Courts must state what

meaning the statute should bear rather than rendering the statute in nullity.

A statute must be construed in such a manner as to make it workable.

42.    In a few cases, the Courts have declined to be bound by the letter when

the letter frustrates the patent purposes of the statute. Ld. Justice J.C. Shah

in
New India Sugar Mills Ltd. v. Commissioner of Sales Tax, Bihar
, 7 noted that

“it is a recognized rule of interpretation of statutes that the expressions used

therein should ordinarily be understood in a sense in which they best

harmonise with the object of the statute, and which effectuate the object of the

Legislature”. The limitation of the purposive role of construction is that the

interpretation shall not result in legislation by the Court. Hardship,

inconvenience, injustice, absurdity and anomalous results are avoided while

construing the statute they need be.
43.    Lord Shaw in Shannon Realities Ltd. v. St. Michel (Ville De),8 notes that

“[w]here words of a statute are clear, they must, of course, be followed but in

their Lordships' opinion, where alternative constructions are equally open that

alternative is to be chosen which will be consistent with the smooth working of

the system which the statute purports to be regulating; and that alternative is

to be rejected which will introduce uncertainty, friction or confusion into the

working of the system”.

44.    T. L. Venkatarama Aiyyar, J in
Tirath Singh vs. Bachittar Singh,9
stated

that “where the language of a statute, in its ordinary meaning and grammatical

construction, leads to a manifest contradiction of the apparent purpose of the

In
Essar Steel India Limited
(supra), this Court considered the scope and

ambit of section 30(2) and (4) on the one hand and also the jurisdiction of the

Adjudicating Authority/NCLAT under sections 30(4),

and
60(5)
of the IBC

on the other hand. The relevant paragraphs read thus:
56.   This Court has held that CIRP under the IBC is based on a flexible model

where market participants (as resolution applicants) can propose solutions for

the revival of the corporate debtor. To put it succinctly, the ratio of

57.4. On 03.11.2022, AGI applied to CCI in Form II for approval of the

In
Gurudevdatta VKSSS Maryadit v. State of Maharashtra,12
this Court,

       while dealing with
section 27(3)
of the Maharashtra Co-operative

       Societies Act, 1960, held that words must be given their due meaning in

       their grammatical sense:
76.    The use of the word ‘shall’ raises a presumption that the particular

provision is imperative. However, the prima facie inference about the provision

being imperative may be rebutted by other considerations, such as – the object,

scope of the enactment, and the consequences flowing from such construction.

The interpretation of the word ‘shall’ as directory has been a purposive effort of

the court to sustain the object of the statute and, at the same time, ensure

compliance with the requirements. This Court has interpreted ‘shall’ as

directory to preserve the legislative effort and intent of the statute.

76.1.
In
Sainik Motors v. State of Rajasthan,16 State of UP
v.
Babu Ram

       Upadhya,17 and State of MP v. Azad Bharat Finance Co.,18
this Court has

       held that the word ‘shall’ does not always imply that a provision is

16 AIR (1961) SC 1480

18 AIR (1967) SC 276
60
mandatory. If the legislative intent or the context requires the statute to

       be not mandatory, then the word ‘shall’ is to be contextually interpreted.

76.2. This Court has also held that the ultimate rule in construing auxiliary

       verbs like ‘may’ or ‘shall’ is to discover the legislative intent without giving

       it a controlling or determinative effect. The subject matter, the purpose

       of the provisions, the object intended to be secured by the statute which

       is of prime importance, and the actual words employed have to be

       considered in determining the nature of the obligation cast by the statute

       while employing ‘shall’ or ‘may’.19
77.    In determining whether the word ‘shall’ is mandatory or directory, the

court examines noscitur a sociis20, the operation, functions, duties, and

consequences for non-performance. The rule of literal interpretation with its

exceptions is noted, and the grammatical interpretation of sections 30 and
31
of IBC sets the stages of consideration of twin approvals – one by the CoC, and

the other by the Adjudicating Authority – while approval or rejection is granted

to the resolution plan. The combination approval as an enclosure to an

applicable resolution plan at the stage of section 30(4) of the IBC is a form or

procedure that does not have consequences. At the same time, the combination

approval to an applicable resolution plan at the stage of consideration of the

Adjudicating Authority under
section 31(1)
and (2) of the IBC becomes

substantial. This is because, a non-compliant resolution plan can be rejected

they appear.
81.   It is argued that the NCLAT in ArcelorMittal (supra),
Vishal Vijay Kalantari
(supra) and
Makalu Trading Limited
(supra) held that the requirement under

proviso to sub-section (4) of
section 31
is directory at the stage of CoC approval.
The view of that NCLAT was confirmed by this Court in
Vishal Vijay Kalantari
(supra) and
Makalu Trading Limited
(supra) while referring to the NCLAT

judgement in ArcelorMittal (supra). The argument of the appellant is that the

confirmation of a view taken by the NCLAT, as above, is either distinguishable
63
or alternatively cannot be treated as a binding precedent for deciding the

controversy in these appeals. In reply, it is argued that the NCLAT has

considered the crux of the issue in these matters and the Civil Appeal(s) that

stood dismissed has the effect of a binding precedent on the question of whether

the proviso to sub-section (4) of
section 31
of the IBC is mandatory or directory.

The absence of a reasoned dismissal order is no reason to re-open an otherwise

established position of law. To appreciate the consideration by NCLAT and

confirmation by this Court, the narrative is presented as follows:
82.   The tabular statement takes note of the conclusions stated by the NCLAT.

The argument against the view taken by this Court in
Vishal Vijay Kalantari
(supra) and
Makalu Trading Limited
(supra) is rejected.

82.1. In matters of trade, industry, and commerce, continuity and consistency

      in precedents are the foundations on which prudent business decisions

      are made. The consistent view in case law enables the market players to

      arrange affairs in compliance with the law and the precedents. In the

      working of the IBC, it does not appear that the only certainty is that

      nothing is certain. The resolution applicant is not to be subjected to

      intolerable uncertainty or not knowing what comes next. While doubt is

      not a pleasant condition, the adjudicatory process should not multiply

      it. The object of IBC is to provide the institutional framework for

      theoretical resolution without considering liquidation as the first option.

      The buoyant economy needs absorption mechanisms to prevent

      collateral and cascading impact on the investors, depositors and

      financial creditors. Therefore, the idea of the IBC is to let the financial

      markets work.
84.    On 05.11.2022, the RP moved for approval under section 30(6) of the IBC

for the resolution of the CoC Dt. 27.10.2022. INSCO, on 14.11.2022, filed

application No. 1497/2022 to reject AGI’s resolution plan for want of CCI

approval. Further consideration by the Adjudicating Authority is paused

because of an interlocutory application, an appeal to the NCLAT, and the

subsequent proceedings in this Court. The resolution plans were submitted

with the contemporaneous perspective of the physical state of affairs of men,

machinery and matters of the corporate debtor. The delay loses the very sheen

in the effort to revive the stressed assets of a corporate debtor. The law provides

for availing legal remedies. It may not be understood as laying down that the

interlocutory applications are not maintainable before the Adjudicating

Authority and NCLAT. Parties are well within their competence to move an

application, including further statutory remedies under IBC in accordance with

law. The outcome must be met with consequences and costs for the

unsuccessful parties. The consequences of delay must also be borne in mind.
In
State Bank of India & Ors. vs. The Consortium of Murari Jalan and Florian

Fritsch & Anr.,21
this Court held CIRP cannot be endlessly postponed, including

under the garb of litigation. This
Court further held
that the completion of CIRP

is imperative to avoid value erosion. The failure of the resolution process will

finally result in the sale of scrap of the assets of the corporate debtor, and

again, a scenario experienced under previous regimes is reflected. It is

axiomatic,   more   particularly   in   commercial   matters,    that   costs   and

consequences of adjudication follow the event. In corporate and commercial

matters, as a corollary, the cost must follow the result. Hence, costs are

awarded while dismissing the appeals and are to be credited to the account of

the RP.

JUDGEMENT

S.V.N. BHATTI, J.
2.       On 21.10.2021, the National Company Law Tribunal, Kolkata Bench

(“NCLT”) admitted CP (IB) 369/2020, an application filed by DBS Bank under
section 7
of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (“IBC”) against

Hindustan National Glass and Industries Limited (“HNGIL”). HNGIL is the

corporate debtor engaged in manufacturing and supplying glass containers.

HNGIL admittedly has a substantial market presence in the relevant market in

India.
5.    INSCO is a multinational company headquartered in Bermuda. It is

engaged in consulting for agriculture, financial management, and business

consultancy. AGI is engaged in manufacturing and supplying glass containers

and has a substantial market share in the relevant market in India. The actual

percentage of market participation of any of the parties is not noted as part of

the narrative on the background circumstances. The parties to the appeal are

in agreement that having the combination approval from CCI for the proposed

resolution plan is attracted to both AGI and INSCO. The distinction in

compliance format is that AGI must follow the Form II process for obtaining the

approval of CCI for the proposed resolution plan; on the contrary, INSCO, not

being a player in the relevant market in India, is subjected to the simple and

straight forward procedure, also known as green channel, contained in Form I.

In
Union of India v. Cipla Ltd,3
this Court, at paragraph 104 of the

judgement, held on the judicial treatment of opinions rendered by expert

bodies:
35.    Further, in
Brahm Dutt v. Union of India,4
this Court held that:
Commission is an expert body which had been

                 created   in   consonance    with    international

                 practice. The Court observed that it might be

                 appropriate if two bodies are created for

                 performing two kinds of functions, one advisory

                 and regulatory, and the other adjudicatory.
Though the Tribunal has been constituted by the
Competition    (Amendment)    Act,    2007

                                                            [S.V.N BHATTI]

NEW DELHI;","20.1. It was argued that the RP adhered to the law and followed NCLAT


                                  13 of 75
      judgments correctly treating the proviso to
Section 31(4)
of the

      IBC, as directory.
20.2. According to Mr. Chidambaram, RP’s role is procedural, with no

      substantive involvement in Resolution Plans. Therefore, there is

      no scope for controversy regarding the RP’s role.
compliance with the proviso, Mr. Rohatgi argues that the proviso

      should be deemed as directory.
21.7. Highlighting the RP’s lack of expertise in managing a glass

      furnace factory, Mr. Rohatgi emphasised upon the importance of

      concluding the CIRP swiftly to avoid jeopardising its survival.
23.   At the outset, the preliminary objection regarding the locus standi

      of the Appellant(s) to prefer the present Appeal(s) must be dealt

      with.
24.
Section 61
of the IBC provides the statutory framework for

      appeals against orders of the Adjudicating Authority i.e., the

      NCLT, stipulating that ‘any person aggrieved’ by such an order

      may prefer an appeal to the Appellate Authority i.e., the NCLAT

      in this case. Further,
Section 62
extends this right of appeal to

      the Supreme Court.
25.   Similarly,
Section 53B
of the Competition Act provides that ‘any

      enterprise or any person aggrieved’ within the statutory

      framework may file an appeal against any order of the CCI to the

      Appellate Tribunal i.e., the NCLAT.
Section 53T
further extends

      this right of appeal to the Supreme Court against any decision or

      order of the NCLAT.
Proviso to
Section 31(4)
IBC
17 of 75
      the proviso to
Section 31 (4)
of IBC.
31.   The NCLAT, as can be seen from the above, concluded that though

  CCI’s approval is mandatory, obtaining ‘prior approval’, is directory.

  Such a conclusion was reached on the understanding that the

  Resolution Applicant does not have control over the timeline within

  which the CCI may render its approval or disapproval, towards the

  combination application. This may in turn, lead to a situation

  wherein the insolvency proceeding is unduly delayed because of a

  pending application seeking approval from the CCI. That might

  undermine the very objective of the Corporate Insolvency Resolution

  Process [hereinafter referred to as ‘CIRP’] itself. The absence of any

  explicit statutory consequences for non-compliance with the proviso

  to
Section 31(4)
IBC was therefore interpreted by the NCLAT as an

  indication that the requirement for prior approval was meant to be

  only directory.
32.   The proviso to
Section 31(4)
of the IBC was inserted by the
Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (Amendment) Act, 2018
. Post-

  amendment, the provision reads thus:
33.   A proviso in a given statute may be introduced to serve various

      purposes, like qualifying or excepting certain provisions from the

      main enactment or insisting on certain mandatory conditions to be

      fulfilled in order to make the enactment workable or as an optional

      addenda to explain the real intendment of the statutory provision.3

      Ordinarily, however, the function of a proviso is to except something

      out of the enactment or to qualify something enacted therein.
34.   The introduction of a proviso, specifically addressing those

      Resolution Plans with provisions for combination, and the use of the

      term ‘prior’ therein, makes it starkly clear that the intent of the

      legislature was to create an exception. This ensures that in cases

      containing combination proposals, the approval of the CCI i.e., the

      regulatory body designated to ensure fair competition in markets and

      preventing anti-competitive practices, should first be obtained before

      the same is approved by the CoC. No other provision of the IBC has

      been pointed out that might suggest otherwise or cause disharmony

      between the scheme and intent of the IBC or the said proviso to
Section 31(4)
of the IBC.
35.   The above provision makes it abundantly clear that the proviso

      herein creates an exception for those Resolution Plans that contain

      provisions for combination. The language used therein appears to be

      clear, precise & straightforward. As such, to understand the

      legislative intent, the Rule of Plain Reading or literal interpretation

      should find favour rather than the rule of purposive interpretation

      as is suggested by the other side.
36.   It has been strongly argued by Mr. Mukul Rohatgi, the learned

      counsel for AGI Greenpac, that the rule of purposive interpretation

      should be adopted in order to interpret the proviso to
Section 31(4)
of the IBC. He, in fact, suggests a departure from the principles of

      literal interpretation. However, the proposition of law is well-settled

      that when the language of the provision is clear and unambiguous,

      literal interpretation is the best way to understand the legislative

      intention behind enacting the particular provision.
41.   In fact, if the statute is plain and unambiguously-worded, the

      consequences of such construction no longer remain a matter for the

      court to decide on8, even if they appear to be strange, surprising,

      unreasonable, unjust or oppressive.9 Further, even hardship,

      inconvenience or penalty10 being the consequence of compliance with

      such construction cannot be deemed sufficient to alter the meaning

      of the language employed by the legislature, if such meaning is clear

      on the face of the statute or the rules.11
43.   Emphasising on construing the meaning from the plain language of
Section 123(7)
of the Representation of the People Act, 1951, as it



 8
Tamil Nadu State Electricity Board v. Central Electricity Regulatory Commission
, (2007) 7

 SC 636.
51.   The above pronouncements make it clear that when the words used

      are clear, plain and unambiguous, the courts are duty-bound to give

      effect to the meaning emerging out of such plain words. The intention

      of the legislature must be gathered from the language used and also,

      the words not used. It becomes imperative to understand those

      words in their natural and ordinary sense, and any interpretation

      requiring for its support addition or substitution or rejection of words

      as meaningless, must ordinarily be avoided.
52.   Courts must always attempt to uphold a provision as it is and not

      invalidate it, merely because one of the possible interpretations could

      lead to such a result. When there is no ambiguity in the words used,

      the question of finding a disguised intention or purpose behind the

      use of a particular word (the word ‘prior’ in this case), would not

      ordinarily arise.
55.   The language of the proviso to
Section 31(4)
of the IBC appears to be

      clear with no ambiguity and in those situations, all words finding

      place in the provision must be given their due meaning.
56.   The efforts must therefore be to construe any text, phrase and/or

      proviso in a reasonable manner without going beyond the limited

      range of permissibility within which the legislative meaning can be

      captured. The use of the word ‘prior’ in the proviso, must be given

      some meaning as by virtue of the same, the statute requires that the




  18 (1984) 2 SCC 500.
28 of 75
      act of obtaining CoC approval for the Resolution Plan must be done

      in a particular manner i.e., the necessary CCI approval for

      Resolution Plans containing combination proposals must be

      obtained prior to such Plan, being granted the CoC’s approval.
61.    The intent of the legislature must therefore be gathered from the

       words it has used in the statute. Naturally, the Court should proceed

       with the assumption that no word has been used in vain or in an

       inapposite manner, by the legislature.22 Courts, when confronted

       with clear statutory language, derive the meaning from the words


 21 (2007) 8 SCC 593.
32 of 75
      Therefore, to interpret the specific word to mean that such an

      approval can be obtained even ‘after’ and not necessarily ‘prior’ to

      the approval by the CoC would amount to reconstructing a statutory

      provision, which is not permissible.
70.   The statute, as can be observed, provided a different threshold for

      the CCI’s approval as compared to approvals to be received from

      other statutory and regulatory bodies. Such arrangement appears

      to be deliberate as the
Competition Act
contains both specific

      restrictions with respect to combinations that may lead to an

      Appreciable Adverse Effect on Competition (AAEC) in the relevant

      market as well as a detailed procedure of enquiry and scrutiny of

      such combinations, to prevent such AAEC. Based on the same, the

      CCI is empowered to either approve, reject or modify such a

      combination or to mould it in a manner that is in consonance with

      the scheme of the
Competition Act
.
Notes on Clauses, Memorandum & Scrivener’s Error
71.   Let us now consider another aspect which is brought forth by the

      learned counsel to indicate the legislative intent of the IBC. This is

      in reference to the Notes on Clauses to the Insolvency and

      Bankruptcy Code (Amendment) Act, 2018 which might have some




                                   35 of 75
      significance for the present discussion. The Notes on Clauses read

      as follows:
Justice Antonion Scalia, Common Law Courts in Civil Law System: The Role of United States
 Federal Courts in Interpreting the Constitution and Laws, A Matter of Interpretation: Federal
 Courts and the Law, 3 (Amy Gutmann, ed., 1997).
78.   The legislative intent in the proviso to
Section 31(4)
IBC, is in clear

      and unambiguous terms. The same specifically provides for prior



 28 (2012) 3 SCC 321.
79.   Bearing in mind the fact that the CCI is empowered to approve,

      reject and/or modify a proposed combination, a Resolution Plan

      approved by the CCI should only be placed before CoC.            The

      ‘commercial wisdom’ accorded to the CoC being paramount, the

      legislature in our understanding, intentionally provided for a prior

      approval of the CCI with respect to Resolution Plans, containing

      combination proposals.
80.   Additionally, the CCI has also been empowered under
Section 31(3)
of the Competition Act as well as
Regulation 25(1)(A)
of the

      Combination Regulations to direct modifications to the Resolution

      Plan or a combination proposal. Therefore, the approval from CCI

      must be obtained before the same is approved by the CoC.

      Otherwise, an illogical situation may arise since any modifications

      so directed by the CCI, would be kept out of the scrutiny of the CoC

      and the CoC would be forced to exercise its commercial wisdom

      without complete information.
86.   When a Resolution Plan containing a provision for a combination

      that leads to an Appreciable Adverse Effect on Competition

      (AAEC) is placed before the CoC for approval before securing prior

      approval from the CCI, the Plan is incapable of being enforced or

      implemented. Specific consequences in law are provided under

      the IBC and the Competition Act for the same. As is clear, such a

      major omission cannot be cured at a later stage. Therefore,



 31 (2015) 4 SCC 544.
(Dis?)Harmony between Stipulated Timelines
88.   However, it must be noted that the model timelines prescribed

      under any regulations, i.e., in the current case, Regulation 40A of

      CIRP Regulations, cannot by any stretch, supersede a statutory

      provision i.e., the proviso to
Section 31(4)
of the IBC. In fact, the

      subordinate legislation must be interpreted in a manner that

      conforms to the statute, and not the other way around, as was

      unacceptably rationalised by the NCLAT.
89.   As far as the two timelines stipulated under the IBC and the

      Competition Act are concerned, the same do not usually cause any



                                   43 of 75
      disharmony or conflict. The only exception could be in the extremely

      rare circumstances discussed below, influenced by external factors.

      But such extreme and unlikely situations cannot and should not be

      allowed to influence our interpretative exercise on the functioning

      of the legislative framework which will fit in with most cases.
92.   In the context of arguments that have been made on the

      disharmony between the two timelines, reference must also be

      made to
Section 6(2)
of the Competition Act. The same is reproduced

      as follows:
15[(2A)No combination shall come into effect until two
             hundred and ten days have passed from the day on
             which the notice has been given to the Commission under
             sub-section(2) or the Commission has passed orders
             under
section 31
, which- ever is earlier.]”
Regulation 5(8)
of the CCI (Procedure in regard to the Transaction

       of Business relating to Combinations) Regulations, 2011 defines

       ‘other document’ as including any document conveying an

       agreement or decision to acquire control over a target company.

       Therefore, the submission of an application before the CCI can be

       done at different stages and need not necessarily wait until the

       Resolution Plan is submitted.
47 of 75
              delay or a large part thereof being attributable to the tardy
              process of the Adjudicating Authority and/or the
              Appellate Tribunal itself, it may be open in such cases for
              the Adjudicating Authority and/or Appellate Tribunal to
              extend time beyond 330 days... ...”
96.   The attempt must therefore be to conclude the entire process of

      insolvency, ‘ordinarily’ within 330 days but in rare circumstances,

      the same can be elongated, particularly when the delay cannot be

      ascribed to the applicants or parties involved but the tardy process

      of the Tribunal or the Adjudicating Authority.


105. The reliance on the decision in
Makalu Trading Ltd. v. Rajiv

     Chakraborty36
, is equally misplaced, as the judgment merely

     reiterates the findings in Arcelor Mittal, without any independent

     analysis or discussion on the merits of the relevant legal

     propositions. Pertinently, Makalu does not address the applicability

     of the proviso to
Section 31(4)
of the IBC, or engage with the legal or

     factual nuances, that may distinguish the cases.


Relevance of CCI & its scrutiny
111. Even if the proviso to
Section 31(4)
of the IBC is kept aside, by

     virtue of the provisions incorporated under Sections 30(2)(e), 30(3)

     and
31(1)
of the IBC, the Resolution Professional has the legal

     obligation to examine each Resolution Plan and determine whether

     it contravenes any provisions of law for the time being in force. In

     this context, the relevant extracts from the IBC are reproduced

     below:
section (2).
…
           (6) The resolution professional shall submit the resolution


                                 53 of 75
          plan as approved by the committee of creditors to the
          Adjudicating Authority.”
S. 31
of the Code states:
(2)     Subject to the provisions contained in sub-section
          (1), any person or enterprise, who or which proposes to
          enter into a combination, shall give notice to the
          Commission, in the form as may be specified, and the fee
          which may be determined, by regulations, disclosing the
          details of the proposed combination, within thirty days
          of—
          …



                                54 of 75
(b) execution of any agreement or other document for
acquisition referred to in clause (a) and clause (d) of
Section 5
or acquiring of control referred to in clause (b) of
that section.
(2-A) No combination shall come into effect until two
hundred and ten days have passed from the day on which
the notice has been given to the Commission under sub-
section (2) or the Commission has passed orders under
Section 31
, whichever is earlier.
(3)    The Commission shall, after receipt of notice
under sub-section (2), deal with such notice in accordance
with the provisions contained in
Sections 29
, 30 and
31
.
…”
31. Orders of Commission on certain combinations. —(1)
Where the Commission is of the opinion that any
combination does not, or is not likely to, have an
appreciable adverse effect on competition, it shall, by
order, approve that combination including the
combination in respect of which a notice has been given
under sub-section (2) of
Section 6
:
57 of 75
     the scope of the Resolution Professional’s powers.
117. In the current case, a prima facie opinion under
Section 29(1)
of

     the Competition Act was found to the effect that AGI’s Resolution

     Plan, as approved by the CoC, was in contravention of
Section 6
of

     the Competition Act. Only after the proposed divestment proposed

     by AGI Greenpac, did the CCI approve the proposed combination.

     Importantly, much before the proposed divestment and the

     approval to such combination was given by the CCI, the Resolution

     Plan was placed, voted upon and approved by the CoC. Therefore,

     it is apparent that AGI Greenpac’s Resolution Plan as approved by

     the CoC was without the requisite approval of the CCI on that date.

     Therefore this would be in contravention of
Section 6(1)
of the

     Competition Act for the combination in question.
121. The interplay between the IBC and the Competition Act presents a

     delicate balance. While the IBC focused on expeditious revival of

     distressed assets, the
Competition Act
ensures that the resolution

     process does not distort market dynamics. The critical regulatory

     risk that emerges at this intersection is the issue of gun-jumping
122.
The Competition Act
operates on a suspensory regime, under

     which no transaction involving a combination can be completed,

     without prior approval from the CCI. Such mandate ensures that

     competitive equilibrium in the market is not disrupted during the


                                 59 of 75
     CIRP. In fact,
Section 43A
of the Act prescribes severe penalties for

     any attempt to consummate the transaction, prior to securing the

     CCI’s approval.
124.
Section 29(1)
of the Competition Act and
Regulation 2(f)
of the

     Competition Regulations, 2011 mandate the issuance of a Show

     Cause Notice [hereinafter referred to as ‘SCN’] to the ‘parties to the

     combination’ if and when the CCI forms a prima facie opinion that

     a combination is likely to cause or has caused Appreciable Adverse

     Effect on Competition (AAEC), within the relevant market. The

     term ‘parties to the combination’ as explicitly defined under
Regulation     2(f)
includes   both   entities   entering   into   the

     combination and the combined entity, if the combination has come

     into effect.
125. In the present case, it is evident that the CCI, while exercising its

     powers under
Section 29(1)
, failed to issue the mandatory SCN to

     all relevant parties, most notably, the target company itself i.e., the

     HNGIL. The SCN dated 10.02.2023 was issued only to the acquirer

     company i.e., in the present case, AGI Greenpac, although the

     involvement of both parties is integral, to the assessment of

     potential AAEC, in the relevant market. This omission constitutes


                                  60 of 75
     a major procedural lapse, as the law clearly requires all parties to

     the combination to be notified of such finding by the CCI. The

     opportunity to respond must also be given to them.
127. The statutory requirement under
Section 29
and
Regulation 2(f)
could not be bypassed and for this omission. the CCI's order (dated

     15.03.2023) was procedurally deficient, undermining the fairness

     and completeness of the investigative process. The importance of

     adhering to the procedural safeguards enshrined in the Act is to

     ensure that all parties to a combination, are given due notice and

     an opportunity to present their respective case.
Sections 29
and
30
of the Competition Act, 2002 when read holistically, delineate

     a structured procedural roadmap that the CCI must traverse when

     it scrutinises combinations that may exert an Appreciable Adverse

     Effect on Competition (AAEC) in the relevant market.
129. Further clarity on this procedural rigour is provided by Section

      30, which explicitly directs that the prima facie opinion formed

      under
Section 29(1)
must guide subsequent steps under Section

62 of 75
     distinction between these terms, underscoring that ‘investigation’

     is a far-reaching exercise of evidence-gathering and fact-finding,

     especially when compared to an ‘inquiry’. Such an investigation,

     as per the mandate of
Section 29(1A)
, is to be executed under the

     aegis of the Director-General, thereby reaffirming the seriousness

     of the scrutiny, envisaged in cases of combinations.
132. The reasoning advanced by the CCI to avoid the issuance of SCN

     to HNGIL under
Section 29(1)
is unacceptable. Only because the

     Resolution Professional did not object to the same does not

     override the statutory requirements prescribed under the scheme

     of the Act, especially because the target company’s participation is

     central to assessing the competitive impact of the combination.
133. While the term ‘parties’ may appear broad and/or encompassing

     all related entities associated with the combination, such an

     interpretation cannot dilute the inherent plurality attached to the

     word ‘parties’, as explicitly stated in the
Competition Act
and its

     Regulations. The use of the plural form signifies a clear legislative

     intent to address not just one entity but multiple parties directly

     involved in the combination process, including but not limited to

     the acquirer, the target, and, where applicable, the combined

     entity, if the combination has come into effect.
134. Plurality of entities ensures that all perspectives, interests, and

     potential   implications   are    considered   in   assessing    the

     combination's impact on competition. The exclusion of the target

     company from the scope of parties especially in cases of insolvency

     where the target retains critical relevance, would undermine the

     procedural safeguards, designed to achieve transparency and

     fairness. The term ‘parties’ must be understood to cover both

     entities participating in and directly affected by the combination,

     ensuring the integrity of competition assessment and compliance

     with statutory provisions under
Sections 29(1)
and
29(2)
. To argue

     otherwise would not only mutilate the term ‘parties’ but would also

     result in procedural lapses and incomplete analysis, defeating the

     very purpose of the regulatory oversight.
135. Those identified lapses demonstrate a departure from the


                                 64 of 75
     procedural rigour, mandated under the
Competition Act
. Such

     deviations, if permitted, would end up compromising on the

     transparency and fairness requirement in a regulatory process.

     The failure to adhere to the procedural requirements of
Sections

     29(2)
to
29(6)
read with
Section 30
of the Competition Act,

     undermines the robustness of the investigative process, rendering

     the CCI order (dated 15.03.2023), susceptible to a bona fide

     challenge.
65 of 75
     requisites, to the submission of any voluntary modification and

     steps to the contrary, cannot be countenanced.
139. The issuance of SCN to both the acquirer and the target under
Section 29(1)
of the Competition Act in our opinion, is a non-
66 of 75
     negotiable procedural imperative. The interplay between the

     provisions of the
Competition Act
and the IBC necessitates a

     careful balancing of competing interests, underscoring the

     indispensability   of     procedural      compliance.    The     lack    of

     participation by the Target in the voluntary modification process,

     especially where the modification entails the divestment of their

     assets, vitiates the approval granted by the CCI and warrants

     remedial intervention by this Court.
146. The absence of mandatory oversight mechanisms, such as third-
71 of 75
     provisions. Providing relief for stressed assets must necessarily

     align with the statutory framework, as adherence to legal

     principles is fundamental to a fair and just resolution process.
151. Where the provisions allow for dilution or departure from the

     intended scheme of the IBC or the
Competition Act
, it is the

     responsibility of the legislature to rectify such inconsistencies

     through appropriate legislative measures and the judiciary should

     not normally venture into the legislative domain.
153. By upholding the mandatory nature of the statutory provision and

     emphasising    upon    the    critical    importance   of   procedural

     safeguards, the principle of rule of law is upheld in alignment with

     global best practices which underscore fairness, predictability and

     transparency. Such an approach not only reinforces the integrity

     and credibility of the legal framework but also highlights India’s

     commitment to fostering a regulatory environment, which is

     conducive to both business and innovation. Additionally, it also

     ensures the protection and enforcement of rights in an equitable

     manner, free from bias or favouritism.
154. Therefore, a balance between the need for expeditious relief and

     adherence to the statutory framework must necessarily be

     maintained, in order to ensure that the objectives of both, the IBC

     and the Competition Act are met in a manner that supports India's

     long-term economic aspirations.
I have had the opportunity to read the well-crafted judgement circulated by my

Learned Brother, Justice Hrishikesh Roy. In spite of my effort to subscribe to

the view taken by my Learned Brother, for the subtle distinction I noticed in

interpreting the proviso to
section 31(4)
of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy

Code, 2016 (“IBC”), I find it apt to express my position on the same through

this opinion.
5.    The RP on 24.05.2022 issued the Request for Submission of Resolution

Plans (“RFRP”). Clauses 2.6.3(c), 3.3 and 4.1.1(k) require compliance with the

mandate of
sections 5
and
6
of the Competition Act by the resolution applicants

to whom the combination would be attracted.
15.   AGI and RP argued that the word ‘shall’ be read as ‘may’. The proviso is

directory and not mandatory. The statutory implication of
section 6
of the

Competition Act is attracted upon the approval of one or the other resolution

plan by the Adjudicating Authority. Thus, on the effective date for the

implementation of the CIRP, if the Resolution Plan has the approval of a

combination under the
Competition Act
, then the resolution plan is fully

compliant.
23.7.   The NCLAT committed illegality by accepting the requirement under

        proviso to sub-section (4) of
section 31
as directory.
12
23.8.    The interpretation adopted by the impugned order is illegal and

         against the well-established canon of literal interpretation of a clear

         and unambiguous provision.
23.12.   The rule of purposive interpretation would be completely inapplicable

         for interpreting proviso to sub-section (4) of
section 31
. The reliance

         on the memorandum explaining the modifications to the Bankruptcy

         Code Amendment Ordinance, 2018, is misconceived.

23.13.   The proviso is used as an exception to sub-section (4) of
section 31
of

         IBC. Being an exception, particularly in the absence of ambiguity, the

         golden rule of interpretation is the only tool for construing the

         meaning of the said proviso and not purposive interpretation for

         ascertaining whether the approval of CCI is mandatory while CoC

         considers the resolution plan.
24.   The Respondents’ arguments are summarised as follows:
The Parliament, guided by the BLRC report, enacted the IBC. The

      statutory scheme of IBC provides for comprehensive remedies, i.e.,

      recovery of debt through maximization of asset value through CIRP, and

      in a chronic case where redemption of debt through CIRP does not make

      business sense for the stakeholders, then liquidation is triggered. The

      fulcrum of IBC is the preservation of the company in distress as a going

      concern and ensuring the discharge of debt(s) of a stressed company.

24.2. Therefore, the interpretation of the proviso to sub-section (4) of
section

      31
is adopted by looking at the statement of objects and reasons of the

      IBC and the statutory scheme laid out from section 4 through section

      32A of the IBC.
24.4. The non-compliance with
section 5
read with
section 6
of the Competition

      Act, if insisted at the stage of CoC voting on the eligible proposals of

      resolution applicants, then the otherwise “feasible” or “viable” test of

      consideration of the commercial wisdom of CoC is expanded on the

      proposal being compliant with the laws in force. The CoC would be

      deprived of a proposal from a resolution applicant which may be more

      feasible, viable and otherwise eligible if threshold compliance of

      combination approval is insisted while CoC is considering the resolution

      plans.
24.6. A careful study of sub-sections (1) and (2) of
section 31
, read with the

      amended provision and proviso to sub-section (4), would demonstrate

      that the actual stage for statutory compliance under the
Competition Act
is material and relevant only when a decision approving a resolution plan

      is pending before the Adjudicating Authority.
24.7. The checklist for consideration by the Adjudicating Authority is that the

      resolution plan, approved by the CoC under sub-section (4) of section 30,

      satisfies the following requirements –

      o   Sub-section (2) of section 30:
24.14.   The statutory compliance status and the effect of giving approval

         under
section 31(1)
and (2) of the IBC is in the exclusive domain of

         the Adjudicating Authority under
section 31(1)
and (2) of the IBC. The

         language of sub-section (2) of
section 31
is unambiguous. The

         examination of requirements of sub-section (2) of section 30 is at the

         stage of examination under
section 31(1)
of the IBC by the

         Adjudicating Authority. The Adjudicating Authority either approves

         the resolution plan approved by the CoC or rejects the plan ground(s)

         set out in
section 31
of the IBC. The consequences for non-

         compliance of a requirement, including combination approval, are

         applied at this stage. The proviso to
section 31(4)
must be read in the

         same sense and tense that corresponds to
section 31(1)
and (2) of the

         IBC.
25.   The BLRC report notes and acknowledges that the failure of a few

business plans is integral to the process of the market economy. When

business failure occurs, the best outcome for society is to have a rapid re-

negotiation between the financiers to finance a going concern using new

arrangements of capital and restructured management. The re-negotiating
21
process is known as the “Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process”. The

primary object of this effort, briefly stated, is the value maximization of the

corporate debtor. The CIRP keeps the corporate debtor as a going concern and

runs on the theory that the value of the business is worth more than the

realisation of the piecemeal distribution of assets. However, if this objective

cannot be achieved, the best outcome for society is the rapid liquidation of a

failing corporate debtor. When such statutory arrangements are put into place,

the market process of creative construction, on the one hand, and creative

destruction, on the other hand, will work smoothly with greater competitive

vigour.
26.   BLRC lays emphasis on a strong and mature market economy. This

involves well-drafted modern laws that replace the laws of the preceding 100

years and high-performance institutions which enforce these new laws. The

Committee has the end word to provide one critical building block of this

process with a modern Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code and the statutory

design associates institutional infrastructure, which reduces delays and

transaction costs. The BLRC, through the IBC, compartmentalized the

functions and duties of RP, CoC and the Adjudicating Authority.
28.   After taking note of the emerging Indian economy, the best practices of

resolution and liquidation in other economies and the model code of UNCITRAL,

the report has recommended the following guiding principles to the Parliament

for a new Code. Broadly, the objects sought to be achieved by the IBC are (i)

provision of certainty in the market to promote efficiency and growth, (ii)

maximization of value of assets, (iii) striking a balance between liquidation and

reorganisation, (iv) ensuring equitable treatment of similarly situated creditors,
(v) provision of timely, efficient and impartial resolution of insolvency, (vi)

preservation of the insolvency estate to allow equitable distribution to creditors,
(vii) ensuring a transparent and predictable insolvency law that contains

incentives for gathering and dispensing information, (viii) recognition of existing

creditor rights and establishment of clear rules for ranking priority of claims,

and (ix) establishment of a framework for cross-border insolvency.
35.    The objective of the IBC at the first instance is to ensure that the business

activity of the corporate debtor as a going concern is preserved even after the

appointment of a resolution professional. By an order under
section 31(2)
of

the IBC, the corporate debtor is made over to the successful resolution

applicant as approved by the Adjudicating Authority. The IBC envisages the

preservation of the rights of financial creditors, operational creditors, and

employees, as well as the supply of goods or services by the corporate debtor

into the market.
38.   It is axiomatic that while applying the rule of literal construction, the

words of a statute are first understood in their natural, ordinary or popular

sense, and phrases and sentences are constructed according to their

grammatical meaning unless such construction leads to absurdity or unless

there is something in the context or in the object of the statute to suggest the

contrary rule of interpretation.
29
enactment, or to some inconvenience or absurdity, hardship or injustice,

presumably not intended, a construction may be put upon it which modifies

the meaning of the words, and even the structure of the sentence"". The literal

and purposive rules of interpretation, as well as their scope, obligation, and

limitations, are prefaced for further discussion. The right consideration of

issues on hand is achieved by not referring to the precedents on literal or

purposive interpretation. It is axiomatic that the precedents on interpretation are

specific to the statute, language and case. The Court, in a given case before it,

goes by the first principles of the respective tools of interpretation.

44.1. The literal interpretation is not an inviolable rule. The decisions referred

      to supra, while underlying the principle involved in literal interpretation,

      had laid down that the literal interpretation, if it leads to hardship,

      inconsistency,    defeats   the   working    of   the   statute,    and   acts

      counterproductive to the purpose and object sought to be achieved by

      the statute. A statute must be construed in such a manner as to make it

      workable.
46.   The swing is whether the literal or purposive rule of interpretation is

applicable for deciding whether approval of CCI at the stage of section 30(4) of
30
IBC is mandatory or directory. To arrive at which one of the interpretations is

applicable, the summary of the idea, roadmap, implementation, and conclusion

of the IBC, as well as the extent needed, is considered. Literal interpretation

satisfies the application of exact meaning to the words used in the proviso, but

whether such application is consistent with other provisions in
section 31
is to

be determined. If literal interpretation leads to inconsistency with the text and

tense used in
section 31
, then the Court attempts to resolve it to make the

section consistent in text and tense.
47.    According to sub-section (26) of
section 5
, a resolution plan is a plan

proposed by the resolution applicant for the insolvency resolution of the

corporate debtor as a going concern in accordance with Part II.
section 25(2)(h)
sets out the duties of an RP and reads thus:
48.    Section 3010 enables a resolution applicant to submit a resolution plan.


10 30 (1) A resolution applicant may submit a resolution plan    [along with an affidavit stating
that he is eligible under Section 29-A] to the resolution professional prepared on the basis of
the information memorandum.
(a) provides for the payment of insolvency resolution process costs in a manner specified by
the Board in priority to the [payment] of other debts of the corporate debtor;
 [(b) provides for the payment of debts of operational creditors in such manner as may be
specified by the Board which shall not be less than—
(ii) the amount that would have been paid to such creditors, if the amount to be distributed
under the resolution plan had been distributed in accordance with the order of priority in sub-
section (1) of
Section 53
,
whichever is higher, and provides for the payment of debts of financial creditors, who do not
vote in favour of the resolution plan, in such manner as may be specified by the Board, which
shall not be less than the amount to be paid to such creditors in accordance with sub-section
(1) of
Section 53
in the event of a liquidation of the corporate debtor.
Explanation 1.—For the removal of doubts, it is hereby clarified that a distribution in
accordance with the provisions of this clause shall be fair and equitable to such creditors.
Explanation 2.—For the purposes of this clause, it is hereby declared that on and from the date
of commencement of the
Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (Amendment) Act, 2019
, the
provisions of this clause shall also apply to the corporate insolvency resolution process of a
corporate debtor—
(ii) where an appeal has been preferred under
Section 61
or
Section 62
or such an appeal is
not time barred under any provision of law for the time being in force; or
(d) the implementation and supervision of the resolution plan;
(e) does not contravene any of the provisions of the law for the time being in force;
(f) conforms to such other requirements as may be specified by the Board.
 [Explanation.—For the purposes of clause (e), if any approval of shareholders is required under
the
Companies Act, 2013
(18 of 2013) or any other law for the time being in force for the
implementation of actions under the resolution plan, such approval shall be deemed to have
been given and it shall not be a contravention of that Act or law.]
(3) The resolution professional shall present to the committee of creditors for its approval such
resolution plans which confirm the conditions referred to in sub-section (2).
 [(4) The committee of creditors may approve a resolution plan by a vote of not less than [sixty-

51.    The Parliament, realising the need for a few amendments to IBC for the

efficacious working of the Code, enacted Act Nos. 26 of 2018 and 26 of 2019.

The ILRC report notes in paragraph 16.2 that the committee deliberated on a

mechanism for obtaining approvals from the concerned regulators post the

approval of the resolution plan but prior to the Adjudicating Authority’s

approval. Amendment Act 26 of 2018 explains, through clause 24 of the notes

on clauses, that where there is a provision for combination, CCI approval shall

be obtained prior to the approval of the resolution plan by the CoC. On the

contrary, the memorandum to the 2018 Ordinance that led to Act 26 of 2018

notes that CCI approval shall be sought prior to the stage at which the

resolution plan is considered by the adjudicating authority.




the resolution plan which shall be binding on the corporate debtor and its employees, members,
creditors, [including the Central Government, any State Government or any local authority to
whom a debt in respect of the payment of dues arising under any law for the time being in
force, such as authorities to whom statutory dues are owed,] guarantors and other stakeholders
involved in the resolution plan:
52.   It is appropriate to refer to the amendments incorporated by Act 26 of

2018 by which sub-section (4) and the proviso were incorporated. The IBC was

enacted with the intention of improving the ease of doing business in India. In

line with this thinking, one of the legislative measures is the amendment to the

proviso to sub-section (4) of
section 31
of the IBC.
It can examine the challenge only in relation to the grounds specified in
section 61(3)
of the IBC, which is limited to matters “other than” enquiry

      into the autonomy or commercial wisdom of the dissenting financial

      creditors.     Thus,   the    prescribed   authorities    (the     Adjudicating

      Authority/NCLAT)       have   been   endowed    with     clearly   demarcated

      jurisdiction as specified in the IBC and are not to act as a court of equity

      or exercise plenary powers.
58.   The above narrative is relied on to argue that the proviso to sub-section

(4) of
section 31
is violated by the RP and CoC. The above literal construction

ignores the circumstances that surround Act 26 of 2018 and Act 26 of 2019,

which introduced a few amendments to both sections 30 and
31
of the IBC.

58.1. The amendment of a provision of law is appreciated by a comparison

      between the pre-amendment and post-amendment law. The amendment

      to an existing law is necessitated to supplement the gaps noted in

      achieving the purpose or object of the existing enactment. The

      Parliament, after realizing the existence of a few bottlenecks in the

      smooth working of the Act in achieving the object, makes amendments

      in the nature of additions, deletions, exceptions, provisos, etc.

58.2. IBC has undergone a few major changes to improve the working of the

      Code. The Parliament, in its wisdom, has not only incorporated the

      amendments but also the place at which the amendments are to be

      positioned.
59.   In the said background, the Parliament has not incorporated the proviso

to sub-section (4) of
section 31
in the text of section 30 of the IBC. Section 30(2)

of the IBC, read with Regulation 39(4) of CIRP Regulations, 2016, has provided

for what is to be reported to the CoC by RP through Form H.
60.   It is axiomatic to not interpret a section by referring to or relying on the

Regulations made by the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (“IBBI”).

The plain requirement for the RP is to state whether the resolution plan

contravenes any of the provisions of the law for the time being in force.
61.   The Parliament, guided by the real-time working of an enactment based

on a report received or otherwise, had undertaken to amend IBC. The amended

and unamended provisions are excerpted as follows:
section (2) of section   approve the resolution
                   30, it shall by order    plan which shall be
                   approve the              binding on the
                   resolution plan          corporate debtor and
                   which shall be           its employees,
                   binding on the           members,
                   corporate debtor         creditors, [including
                   and its employees,       the Central
                   members, creditors,      Government, any
                   guarantors and           State Government or
                   other stakeholders       any local authority to
                   involved in the          whom a debt in
                   resolution plan.         respect of the
                                            payment of dues
                                            arising under any law
                                            for the time being in
                                            force, such as
                                            authorities to whom
                                            statutory dues are
                                            owed,] guarantors and
                                            other stakeholders
                                            involved in the
                                            resolution plan:
62.   Section 30(1) provides for the submission of a resolution plan by the

resolution applicants. Section 30(2) obligates the RP to examine each resolution

plan received by the RP to confirm that the resolution plan does not contravene
47
any of the provisions of law for the time being in force. The relevant portion of

Form H is reproduced hereunder:
63.2.1. The manner of distribution may take into account the order of priority

          amongst creditors as
laid down in
sub-section (1) of
section 53
.

63.2.2. The manner of distribution includes the priority and value of the

          security interest of the secured creditors.
50
65.1.
Section 31(1)
provides for approval of a resolution plan by the

      Adjudicating Authority and is summarised thus:
be given their ordinary meaning. It is yet another

                  rule of construction that when the words of the

                  statute are clear, plain and unambiguous, then the

                  courts are bound to give effect to that meaning,

                  irrespective of the consequences. It is said that the

                  words themselves best declare the intention of the

                  lawgiver. The courts have adhered to the principle

                  that efforts should be made to give meaning to each

                  and every word used by the legislature and it is not

                  a sound principle of construction to brush aside

                  words in a statute as being inapposite surpluses, if

                  they can have a proper application in circumstances

                  conceivable    within    the    contemplation    of   the

                  statute.”

                                                      (emphasis supplied)


66.2. Further, this Court, in
Harbhajan Singh v. Press Council of India,13
dealt

       with the interpretation of sub-section (7) of
section 614
of the Press

       Council Act, 1978, and employed grammatical tenses to present tenses

       used in the statute:
words “retiring”, used in the present tense, and

“renomination” speak aloud of the intention of the

legislature. If the word “retiring” was capable of

being read as “retired” (sometime in the past) then

there would have been no occasion to use

“renomination” in the construction of the sentence.

If the intention of law-framers would have been not

to permit a person to be a member of the Council for

more than two terms in his lifetime then a different,

better and stronger framing of the provision was

expected. It could have been said: “no member shall

be eligible for nomination for more than two terms”,

or it could have been said:“a retired member shall

not be eligible for nomination for more than two

terms”.
16. We are clearly of the opinion that sub-section

(7) of
Section 6
of the Press Council Act must be

assigned its ordinary, grammatical and natural

meaning as the language is plain and simple. There

is no evidence available, either intrinsic or external,

to read the word “retiring” as “retired”. Nor can the

word “renomination” be read as nomination for an

independent term detached from the previous term

of membership or otherwise than in succession.
67.   The rules of grammar are to be applied unless those rules contradict the

legislative intent or purpose. This statement is more so if it refers to legislative

intent or purpose manifested in the only manner in which a legislature can

authoritatively do so in the text of the enactment. Though not to find out

violability in the text of the enactment, but to keep the content consistent

throughout the enactment – the court gathers the meaning of all the

expressions used in the same section. In this manner, the courts have applied

grammatical construction to provisions of law.
68.   In sub-section (2) of
section 31
, the words “does not confirm to the

requirements of sub-section (1) of
section 31
” grammatically interpreted throw

light on the stage of satisfactory compliance of all the requirements of sub-

section (2) of section 30. The Parliament, in its wisdom, would have employed

the expression “did not” in place of “does not” if the requirement is that the

resolution plan is fully compliant at a stage before consideration of the

resolution plans by the CoC. As part of the interpretative process, the Court

ought not to lose sight of expressions which are in the present tense, such as

“meets”, “does not”, and “satisfies” in
section 31
of the IBC. The word “confirm”

literally means “to verify” for both positive recordings of requirements of sub-

section (1) of
section 31
and also negative recordings of omissions or illegality

in the resolution plans voted by the CoC. There is no ambiguity that when sub-

section (1) of
section 31
is referred to in both the eventualities stated above, it

includes clause (e) of section 30(2) of the IBC. The above literal construction,

as has been canvassed by the appellants, must be applied to the entire scheme
55
of sections 30 and
31
and not merely in isolation to the proviso to sub-section

(4) of
section 31
of the IBC. Sub-sections (1) and (2) of
section 31
obligate the

Adjudicating Authority in its jurisdiction to decide these aspects and consider

whether approval should be granted or rejected.
69.     The consequences of approval are also set out in sub-section (1) of
section

31
, including transferring the business of the corporate debtor to a successful

resolution applicant. Sub-section (4) grants a window of one year to the

successful resolution applicant for obtaining permissions, licenses or permits

under      applicable    laws.   These     are   ex    post    facto   operational

permissions/consents/licences needed to run the business as a going concern

by the successful resolution applicant and to avoid civil or penal consequences.

Sub-section (4) provides for a legal fiction to continue to operate with the

existing permissions/licences/consents in favour of the corporate debtor from

a host of authorities by the successful resolution applicant.
70.     Whereas the meaning, definition and implication of combination

attracting
sections 5
and
6
of the Competition Act are distinct. By keeping in

perspective the language of
sections 5
and
6
of the Competition Act, the

combination should have the approval of CCI on the day on which the

resolution applicant receives approval under
section 31(1)
of IBC. In the

alternative, the absence of combination approval would result in the

combination being void. The successful resolution applicant cannot be allowed

to take over the management awaiting orders of CCI, and the successful

resolution applicant cannot undertake business operations. The memorandum
56
and notes on clauses appended to the ordinance and amendment recognised

the need for statutory protection and the need for due compliance with

statutory requirements of approval of combination under the
Competition Act
by the successful resolution applicant. There is an inconsistency and ambiguity

in the stage of having CCI approval. In such cases, the text of the amended and

unamended sections should guide the interpretation.
71.   Section 30(4) does not obligate the CoC to examine whether the

resolution plan contravenes the requirements of section 30(2)(e) of the IBC. The

comprehensive proposals submitted by the RP and the resolution of the CoC

will disclose feasibility and viability. The proposal of the successful resolution

applicant being legally compliant in a CIRP attracting CCI’s approval for

combination is examined by the Adjudicating Authority.
72.
Essar Steel
(supra) has laid down as a clear principle or ratio that the

CoC is primarily concerned with feasibility, viability and the manner of

distribution proposed, etc., amongst the creditors and may keep in mind
section 53(1)
of the Code. The insistence upon approval of CCI before CIRP

reaches section 30(4) would limit the number of eligible resolution applicants,

and the core objects of CIRP, intended to benefit the stakeholders through

maximization of recovery, is defeated. Noted from the sense of commercial

prudence, unless the resolution plan is acceptable to the CoC, a question arises

as to the prudence for a business entity to move the CCI for approval. Through

the Amendment Act, the proviso to subsection (4) has been inserted within
section 31
. If the timing of having approval of the combination is at the stage
57
where the CoC is considering the resolution plans, then the insertion would

have been in section 30, but not as is reflected in the amended
section 31
of

the IBC. Stepping up the requirement to a stage not envisaged by the

parliament, particularly not resulting in a consequence for not having the

approval of CCI, would be akin to writing too much into the sentence. In this

context, if the requirement of approval of combination at the stage of CoC is

held as mandatory, then through a literal interpretation of the proviso to
section 31(4)
, the Court would be catapulting the proviso to a place not

expressed by the parliament. Precisely reiterated, such interpretation, apart

from causing difficulties in CIRP defeats the very object of maximization of

recovery.
73.   In contradistinction,
section 31(4)
specifically refers to due compliance

with the requirements of sub-section (1) of
section 31
, which then refers to the

requirements in sub-section (2) of section 30 with regard to approval of the

resolution plan. The statutory compliance by the resolution applicant is divided

into two stages viz., firstly, sub-section (4) provides a window time of one year

to obtain necessary approval under any law by the resolution applicant; and

secondly, having the combination approval before sub-section (2) of
section 31
of IBC. This said compliance status enables the Adjudicating Authority to

accept or reject a resolution plan which does not confirm to the requirements

referred to in sub-section (1) of
section 31
. The final consideration of the

resolution plans before the Adjudicating Authority arises in the manner
laid

down by
this Court in
Essar Steel
(supra). The absence or presence of
58
combination approval while a decision is taken under sub-section (4) of section

30 is not very relevant from the perspective of feasibility or viability. The

Adjudicating Authority, if it is satisfied that the resolution plan has provisions

for effective implementation, then one facet of verification is over. After which,

it is verified whether to reject the resolution plan for not confirming to the

requirements referred to in sub-section (1) of
section 31
. To wit, it is noted as

an example that a resolution applicant gets into the management of the

corporate debtor by an order under
section 31(1)
of the IBC, and has

combination approval for the resolution plan on that day, then the consequence

of
section 6
of the Competition Act, namely the combination being void, is not

attracted. The purpose and object of the IBC and the subsequent amendments

are to provide theoretical and practical resolution to the financial difficulties of

a stressed corporate debtor for the benefit of the stakeholders of the corporate

debtor. The statutory scheme is not intended to give undue advantage or

hardship to the resolution applicants.
74.   Yet another reason taken note is that as per the statutory scheme, the

resolution plan receives two kinds of approvals, one by the CoC under sub-

section (4) of section 30 primarily on feasibility and viability and another from

the Adjudicating Authority that the resolution plan has provisions for its

effective implementation and that the resolution plan confirms to sub-section

(2) of section 30, including clause (e). The proviso to sub-section (4) of
section

31
needs to be carefully examined. It may be noted that the proviso to sub-
59
section (4) of
section 31
refers only to a resolution plan containing a provision

for combination.
78.   When adopting a consequentialist approach, it becomes clear that the

insistence upon a combination approval at the stage of Section 30(4) does not

place the stakeholders at an advantageous position. Further, presenting the

combination approval at the stage of consideration by the Adjudicating

Authority under
section 31(1)
and (2) does not diminish the value of the

stressed assets because of robust competition among eligible resolution

applicants. Further, the opportunity cost that arises from treating the stage at

which combination approval is required as mandatory may disturb the smooth

working of the intricate and competitive insolvency resolution system that the

IBC envisages. Thus, the consequences of compliance and non-compliance with

all the legal requirements of the resolution plan arise only before the

Adjudicating Authority. Consequently, to keep
section 31
uniform in all

perspectives, it is concluded that in the place of literal interpretation, purposive

interpretation is apt; therefore, the word ‘shall’ in the proviso to
section 31(4)
of the IBC is interpreted and held as directory.
79.   From the above discussion, it is held that the proviso to sub-section (4)

of
section 31
is directory and would be compliant with IBC and the Competition

Act. Hence, the combination approval of CCI at the stage of consideration of the

resolution plan by the Adjudicating Authority under
section 31(1)
would be

proper and legal. Such interpretation keeps the operations of the successful

resolution applicant as a going concern, without deviating from the rigour of
62
the
Competition Act
, and simultaneously, a one-year window is granted to

obtain licenses, permissions, consents and other regulatory approvals

envisaged by a host of laws. Therefore, the proviso is interpreted purposively

and held that the approval of a combination of CCI at the stage of consideration

by CoC is directory and not mandatory. By operation of
section 31(2)
of the

IBC, to avoid rejection of a fully compliant and voted resolution plan, the

Adjudicating Authority confirms that the approval of the combination is

available before implementing the resolution plan. At best, the use of the words

“prior to” is a temporal expression whose mandatory or directory nature is to

be determined from the context surrounding
section 31
.
80.   IBC and the Competition Act have timelines for the discharge of a duty

and function. In this light, it is impermissible to interpret the provisions in one

enactment by keeping in perspective the starting point of a timeline and the

termination of a timeline in the other enactment. The enactments are allowed

to work parallelly and without pressure for performance from the other in line

with the duties and obligations cast through the enactments.
83.    The view taken by the NCLAT on the question of whether the requirement

of proviso to sub-section (4) of
section 31
of IBC is mandatory or directory is

correct. Thus, the appeals fail.
1.       The civil appeals assail the order Dt. 28.07.2023 of the National

Company Law Appellate Tribunal, Principal Bench, New Delhi (“NCLAT”). The

appeals arise under the
Competition Act, 2002
(“
Competition Act
”).
compliance with
section 29(2)
renders the combination approval Dt.

15.03.2023 illegal and unsustainable. The prima facie opinion formed by the

CCI under
section 29(1)
of the Competition Act steps up consideration to the

stage of investigation. The combination approval under
section 31
could be

granted only after complying with
section 29(2)
of the Competition Act.
Regulation 25(1) (a)
of Combination Regulations 2011 has been misinterpreted

or misapplied. The NCLAT in the above set of contentions framed the following

points for consideration:
2.   Whether
Section 29
, sub-section (1)
Section 29(1)
of the
     contemplates that a Show Cause          Competition Act contemplates
     Notice to be issued to the parties to   that show cause notice has to
     combination, i.e., both acquirer and    be issued to the parties in
     the target entity or word 'parties'     combination. Thus, the notice
     occurring in
Section 29(1)
has to be    has to be issued to the target
     read singularly?                        and the acquirer. In the
                                             present case, show cause
                                             notice was merely issued to
                                             the acquirer – AGI.
3.   Whether non-issuance of Show            The mere non-issuance of
     Cause Notice to HNGIL vitiates the      notice does not vitiate the CCI
     order of approval granted by the        proceedings. The reasoning
     Commission under
Section 31
, sub-       adopted by the NCLAT was
     section (1)?                            that the RP has no objection
                                             and placed the Resolution
                                             Plan before the Adjudicating
                                             Authority.
4.   Whether after formation of prima-       The CCI noted that there was
     facie opinion that combination is       no occasion to form an
     likely to cause an appreciable          opinion under
Section 29(2)
of
     adverse effect on competition by the    the
Competition Act
under the
     CCI under
Section 29
, sub-section       circumstances of the case.
     (1), there was no occasion to form
     again a prima facie opinion under
Section 29(2)
after receipt of
     response to the Show Cause Notice
     and the CCI was required to
     complete the further process under
Section 29(2)
including direction to
     the parties to the combination to
     publish details of combination?
5.   Whether the process as                  The process as contemplated
     contemplated under
Section 29
,          under
Section 29
of the Act
     subsection (2) having not been          was complied with since the

completed by the CCI before             opinion was given under
     passing the order dated
Section 29(1)
of the Act, and
     15.03.2023, the order passed by         had not reached the stage of
     the CCI is against the procedure

of the Act.
     prescribed under
Section 29
and
     deserved to be set aside?
6.   Whether in spite of Respondent          The CCI, after issuing show
     No.2 along with response to Show        cause notice AGI suggested
     Cause Notice having offered             modification, thereafter CCI

     facie concern expressed in the said     Sections 30 and

                                             combination.
8.   Whether the Commission in the           There is application of mind,
     impugned order has examined the         and the requirements under

, sub-section (4) of the
Competition Act
have been
     Act or the impugned order suffers       followed.
19.         The arguments are summed up as follows:
Therefore, the conditional approval of combination under
section 31
of

      the Competition Act is vitiated.
(3)The Commission may invite any person or member of the public, affected or likely to be affected
by the said combination, to file his written objections, if any, before the Commission [within ten
days] from the date on which the details of the combination were published under sub-section
(2).
23.3. Show cause notice is issued expecting a reply on why an investigation

      in respect of such a combination should not be conducted.

23.4. A show cause notice in legal parlance means the opportunity given to the

      addressee to say what his case is, on the prima facie opinion formed for

      further steps under
section 29
are warranted or not. As part of the

      inquisitorial exercise, the CCI verifies and applies the threshold of

      precautionary principle to understand whether AAEC in the proposed

      combination would arise or not. If
section 29
is worded such that in all

      the cases where prima facie opinion is formed, the corollary of forming

      such opinion leads to calling for the DG’s report, directing parties to

      publish details, then the expression as contained in
section 29
would

      have been different.
Section 29(1)
of the Competition Act, as worded by

      the parliament, provides for formation of prima facie opinion, issuance of

      show cause notice and receiving a reply from the party. The intermediary

      step of show cause notice and reply provides an opportunity to

      satisfactorily explain the doubts entertained by CCI while forming the

      prima facie opinion on AAEC. In other words, the argument that the

      issuance of show cause notice is preceded by prima facie opinion and

      other steps of
section 29
are followed such course would go contrary to

      the plain language of
section 29(1)
of the Competition Act.
18
27.   The show cause notice under
section 29(1)
is intended to get a response

or clarification from the acquirer on the combination which is likely to cause or

has caused AAEC within the relevant market in India. The prima facie opinion

is required in law to set in motion the show cause notice. The CCI has

jurisdiction upon being satisfied with the response as per the scheme of the

section to not proceed further. The argument of the appellants would result in

the show cause notice being treated as a decision to investigate the Form II

application filed for approval of a combination. Under sub-section (2) of
section

29
, the Commission is of the prima facie opinion that the combination has or

is likely to have AAEC. The distinction on the prima facie opinion being formed

under
sections 29(1)
and
29(2)
is emphasised thus:
28.   It may be noted that to form a prima facie opinion under sub-section (2)

of
section 29
of the Competition Act, the CCI in sequence has:
In these matters, the three of us could not reach a common

conclusion. Brother Justice Sudhanshu Dhulia has concurred with
Page 1 of 2
the opinion that has been penned by me, while Brother Justice S.V.N.

Bhatti has decided to write a separate opinion canvassing an alternate

view, reaching a different conclusion. However, such differences must

be understood as useful steps towards the evolution of jurisprudence

in the field of Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 and the
Competition Act, 2002
. In that context, I am reminded of the quote

from Shakespeare’s “The Taming of the Shrew” the theme of which we

do not necessarily endorse.       But there the playwright perhaps

accidentally, touched the world of our adversarial litigation. He wrote -

“And do as adversaries do in law, strive mightily. But eat and drink

as friends”.","3.   Combining with HNGIL is AGI Greenpac Ltd. [hereinafter referred

     to as ‘AGI Greenpac’] i.e., the Successful Resolution Applicant,

     which is the second largest company in the field of glass packaging

     and manufacturing in India, after HNGIL. With two manufacturing




                                    3 of 75
     plants in Telangana, AGI Greenpac is the leading manufacturer of

     container glass. The combination between AGI Greenpac and

     HNGIL, with potential market share of 80-85% in F&B segment

     and 45-50% in alco-beverage segment, is generating a key issue

     for adjudication since the combination of the two major players in

     this sector is likely to result in an Appreciable Adverse Effect on

     Competition [hereinafter referred to as ‘AAEC’] in the glass

     packaging industry generally and in particular, within the sub-

     segments of F&B and alco-beverages.
4.   The main contesting party to the aforementioned proposed

     combination is the Bermuda-registered Appellant – Independent

     Sugar Corporation Ltd. [hereinafter referred to as ‘INSCO’],

     incorporated in 1984, which also submitted their Resolution Plan

     for HNGIL – the Corporate Debtor/Target Company in India.
5.   After the CIRP was initiated against HNGIL by DBS Bank

     [hereinafter referred to as ‘Financial Creditor’] under
Section 7
of

     the IBC, the Adjudicating Authority i.e., National Company Law

     Tribunal (Kolkata Bench), admitted the matter on 21.10.2021. An

     Expression of Interest [hereinafter referred to as ‘EOI’] was floated

     on 25.03.2022, by the Resolution Professional as per Form G

     under Regulation 36(A)(1) of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board

     of India (Insolvency Resolution Process for Corporate Persons)




                                 4 of 75
     Regulations, 2016. Within the EOI, Clauses 3.3 & 4.1.1(k)

     prescribed a mandatory requirement of approval from the

     Competition Commission of India [hereinafter referred to as ‘CCI’]

     prior to the approval of the Resolution Plan, by the Committee of

     Creditors [hereinafter referred to as CoC’].
6.   In response to the above, both INSCO (Appellant) and AGI

     Greenpac submitted their respective Resolution Plans in April

     2022, for consideration. On 19.05.2022, a provisional list of

     eligible Resolution Applicants was published with both the

     Resolution Applicants placed at Sl. No. 6 (INSCO/Appellant) and

     Sl. No. 5 (AGI Greenpac/Respondent 2), respectively.
21.6. The locus standi for Appellants as the unsuccessful resolution

      applicant is questioned, as they lack vested rights in the CIRP. It

      is also argued that the workmen and operational creditors have

      no standing to challenge a Resolution Plan.
30.   A few paragraphs from the impugned NCLAT order being relevant

      are extracted herein below:
119. Before delving into the substantive aspects of the Competition law,

     the relevant facts and procedural trajectory that lead to the

     present appeal needs to be referred. Upon AGI Greenpac’s Form I



                                58 of 75
     submission on 27.09.2022, the CCI found the information

     submitted to be insufficient and directed them to file a detailed

     Form II. On 15.03.2023, the CCI approved the proposed

     combination, predicated upon voluntary modifications offered by

     AGI Greenpac, including the divestment of an HNGIL plant located

     in Rishikesh, to mitigate the Appreciable Adverse Effect on

     Competition (AAEC).
128. Apart from mandating the issuance of a SCN to the concerned

     parties, upon the formation of a prima facie opinion that the

     combination in question warrants investigation, the statutory

     obligations in the form of
Sections 29(2)
to
29(6)
outline the


                                61 of 75
      consequential steps, aimed at gathering comprehensive data from

      not just the acquirer and the target company, but also from other

      stakeholders, potentially impacted by the combination. The

      legislative wisdom embedded within these provisions attempts to

      recognise the ripple effects of the existence of an Appreciable

      Adverse Effect on Competition in a market, which would transcend

      the immediate parties to the transaction, thereby necessitating a

      broader consultation and data collection process.","9.   On 22.10.2022, CCI declared the application filed by AGI Greenpac

     as ‘not valid’. Thereafter, final Resolution Plans were submitted for

     consideration by the CoC. It must however be noted that at that

     stage, neither AGI Greenpac’s Resolution Plan had the requisite

     CCI approval nor did they have any pending application, seeking

     such approval from the CCI.
13. On 10.03.2023, AGI Greenpac submitted a divestment plan to CCI

     in respect of one of the seven HNGIL plants (situated in

     Uttarakhand), as part of a voluntary modification, to comply with

     the requirements of Competition laws. On 15.03.2023, CCI

     granted an approval to AGI Greenpac’s combination proposal with

     HNGIL (Corporate Debtor/Target Company), subject to the

     compliance of certain modifications including the divestment of

     one of the seven HNGIL plants (Rishikesh, Uttarakhand).
14. Challenging the approval to HNGIL and AGI Greenpac’s Resolution

     Plan and seeking reconsideration of INSCO’s Resolution Plan,

     INSCO filed an application before NCLT Kolkata. On 28.04.2023,

     the NCLT rejected the application, thereby upholding the approval

     granted to AGI Greenpac’s Resolution Plan, stating that the



                                7 of 75
     required CCI approval under
Section 31(4)
IBC had been obtained

     in the meantime. While challenging the NCLT rejection dated

     28.04.2023, the Appellant filed the Company Appeal (AT)

     (Insolvency) No. 735/2023 before the NCLAT.
15. The NCLAT vide judgment dated 18.09.2023 upheld the approval

     accorded to AGI Greenpac’s Resolution Plan, stating that although

     the requirement of approval by the CCI was mandatory in nature,

     its prior approval by the CoC, was only directory. This is because

     the timeline for CCI to decide upon a combination proposal is

     much longer and should not lead to a situation where the CIRP is

     frozen or halted because of a pending application before the CCI.
17. It is these above decisions of the NCLAT (dated 28.07.2023 and

     18.09.2023) that have been challenged by INSCO in the lead Civil

     Appeal. Arguments in support of INSCO’s stand have been

     advanced by learned Senior Advocates Dr. A. M. Singhvi and Mr.

     Mahesh Jethmalani. On the other side, the Successful Resolution

     Applicant i.e., AGI Greenpac is represented by learned Senior

     Advocates Mr. Mukul Rohatgi and Mr. Parag Tripathi. The learned



                                8 of 75
      Solicitor General Mr. Tushar Mehta, appears for the CoC. The

      learned Senior Advocate Mr. P. Chidambaram appears for the

      Resolution Professional while the CCI is represented by learned

      Senior Advocate Mr. Balbir Singh. For the other parties,

      submissions were advanced by learned Senior Advocates Mr. Rana

      Mukherjee, Mr. Dushyant Dave, Mr. Amit Sibal, Mr. Dhruv Mehta,

      Mr. Neeraj Kishan Kaul and Mr. Rajshekhar Rao.
19.   Appearing for the CoC, Mr. Tushar Mehta, the learned Solicitor

      General, inter alia, made the following submissions:
103. Also in that case, the CCI’s approval did not address issues relating

     to a potential Appreciable Adverse Effect on Competition (AAEC) in

     the relevant market. The approval so granted by the CCI did not

     impose any modifications to the Resolution Plan either. On the other

     hand, the present case involves substantive concerns regarding an

     Appreciable Adverse Effect on Competition (AAEC), which required

     CCI’s careful consideration and proposed modifications if any, to

     ensure compliance with appropriate laws.
118. What is also of great relevance is that after the COC’s approval,

     the Resolution Plan cannot be modified in any manner since the

     Adjudicating Authority can only approve the Resolution Plan, as

     has been approved by the CoC. This is made clear by
Section 31(1)
of the IBC.
120. Vide its Order dated 28.07.2023, the NCLAT upheld the CCI’s

     conditional approval, holding that the voluntary remedies

     sufficiently mitigated competitive concerns and that the absence

     of notice to HNGIL did not vitiate the approval, especially given the

     RP’s non-objections.
131. In the present matter, the procedural sanctity prescribed under

     the   scheme   has   been    regrettably   disregarded,   with   the

     Commission failing to solicit inputs from public, affected

     stakeholders and those likely to be affected by such combination

     under
Section 29(2)
. This omission not only contravenes the

     statutory intent but also diminishes the transparency and

     inclusivity that underpin the review mechanism for combinations.

     The legislative scheme unambiguously envisions an investigation

     that encompasses a wide array of stakeholders, as combinations

     inherently possess the potential to reshape market dynamics in

     ways that ripple across the competitive landscape.
3.    DBS Bank, as a financial creditor, moved an application under
section 7
for Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (“CIRP”) before the National

Company Law Tribunal, Kolkata Bench (“Adjudicating Authority”) against

Hindustan National Glass and Industries Limited (“HNGIL”), the corporate

debtor. On 21.10.2021, the Adjudicating Authority admitted the application
3
filed under
section 7
against HNGIL. Mr. Girish Sriram Juneja, respondent

No.1, is the Resolution Professional (“RP”).
21.     Shri Tushar Mehta, learned Solicitor General appeared for the Committee

of Creditors.
24.15.   An interested resolution applicant to whom the requirement of

         approval in Form II of CCI is attracted ought not to be disqualified

         from consideration by the CoC in spite of such an applicant satisfying

         the eligibility criteria stipulated by the CoC. On the one hand, the

         scheme in the proviso to subsection (4) of
section 31
clearly delineates

         a condition precedent to an adjudication order under
section 31(2)
of

         the IBC and, on the other hand, the main body of
section 31(4)
provides for obtaining ex post facto permissions within one year under

         different enactments.
53.   Learned counsel appearing for the parties have made a few submissions

on the scope and applicability of external aids, such as the memorandum and

explanatory note appended to the amending Act. For continuity, the

memorandum and the notes on clauses are excerpted hereunder:
6.    On 18.08.2022, INSCO sought clarification from the RP on the

combination approvals and the RP, by reply e-mail Dt. 25.08.2022, informed

INSCO that CCI’s approval could be obtained after the approval of the

resolution plan by CoC but prior to the filing of the resolution plan before the

Adjudicating Authority.
8.    On 03.11.2022, AGI filed notice in Form II before the CCI for the approval

of a combination of the successful resolution plan. On 17.11.2022, CCI sought

additional information/documents from AGI. AGI, through the reply Dt.
4
08.12.2022, responded to the queries raised by the CCI. On 19.12.2022, AGI

filed the additional submissions/material before the CCI.
9.   Whether order of the Commission         Natural justice principles are
     dated 15.3.2023 can be said to          followed when there are civil
     have been passed in violation of        consequences. There is no
     principles of natural just since the    entitlement given to other
     objections filed by Appellant the       persons other than those
     U.P. Glass Manufacturers Syndicate      given notice to participate in
     even after the order dated              the proceedings. The filing of
                                             objections happens under
10
22.02.2024 were not duly
Section 29(2)
, and since the
              considered?                           stage had not arisen, UPGMS
                                                    cannot claim violation of
                                                    natural justice.
19.9. Shri Balbir Singh, appearing for CCI, argued against the findings

      recorded on the need to issue notice to parties, i.e., the acquirer and the
13
target. He also argued to sustain the orders of CCI and NCLAT in so far

      as the approval of the combination is concerned.
20.   Shri Mukul Rohatgi, the learned Senior Counsel appearing for AGI,

principally made his submissions to sustain the orders of CCI and NCLAT,

particularly by relying on the relevant portions of the respective orders. He

argued on the locus standi of appellants to challenge the order Dt. 15.03.2023

of CCI. The arguments are summed up as follows:","18.   Dr. Abhishek Manu Singhvi, learned senior counsel for INSCO

      i.e., the unsuccessful Resolution Applicant. (Appellant in Civil

      Appeal       No.   6071/2023),   inter   alia,   made   the   following

      submissions:
21.5. Moreover, since there was no change in AGI Greenpac’s

      Resolution Plan, it was argued that Plan is not conditional. In any

      case, these issues should not be entertained by the Supreme

      Court at this premature stage, as these are pending for

      consideration before the NCLT.
22.   Mr. Parag Tripathi, supplementing for AGI Greenpac, invoked the

      Principle of Scrivener’s Error, highlighting an inadvertent drafting

      error in the proviso to
Section 31(4)
of the IBC that rendered


                                15 of 75
      unclear the original legislative intent. It is therefore argued that

      courts can pierce through the alleged obvious error and discern

      the true purpose behind the enactment.
66.   To further fortify that the proviso has been interpreted as above in

      the correct manner, an analysis of the context in which and the

      intent with which the proviso to
Section 31 (4)
of the IBC was brought

      into effect, guides us further:
81.   It is for the above reasons that the legislature has devised a scheme



                                    40 of 75
      wherein the Resolution Plan with its proposed modifications must

      be placed before the COC to enable it to compare all possible plans

      of prospective Resolution Applicants. Only then can the CoC’s

      commercial wisdom be exercised assiduously.
41 of 75
      Union31, as well as
Indore Development Authority v. Manoharlal.32
90.   In that context, the timeline of 210 days as stipulated under the
Competition Act
would be attracted only in cases which involve an

      extremely high degree of AAEC, mostly indicative of a complicated

      super-monopolistic behemoth. In fact, it must be borne in mind

      that CCI itself in its Annual General Report for the year 2022–2023

      stated that the average time required to dispose of combination

      applications, is usually 21 working days. There has been no

      recorded instance till date where, more than 120 days were taken

      by the CCI to approve a combination proposal. Additionally, of the

      99 combination proposals approved by the CCI, an overwhelming

      85 of those were approved within 30 days and the rest 14 approvals

      took less than 120 days in toto. Therefore, the extreme and rare

      examples projected by the counsel for AGI Greenpac and CoC need

      not be given undue importance, in the present interpretative

      exercise.
However, only one such combination proposal has been received in

      the past few years.
140. Mr. Rajshekhar Rao, learned senior counsel, had highlighted

     material discrepancies in the operational capacity data furnished

     by AGI Greenpac and HNGIL, including but not limited to:

S.V.N. BHATTI, J.
10.   AGI contended that the requirement in the proviso to
section 31(4)
of the

IBC is directory and not mandatory. The combined reading of
section 31
of IBC

with
section 6(2)
of the Competition Act would stipulate that the statutory

compliance of combination must be available when a decision is taken on the

proposal of the resolution applicant by the Adjudicating Authority. Thus,

praying for the rejection of IA (IB) No.1497/KB/2022 filed by the RP.
19.     Dr. Abhishek Manu Singhvi, Shri Mahesh Jethmalani, Shri Rajshekhar

Rao and Shri Dhruv Mehta, learned Senior Counsel, have appeared for the

appellants.
20.     Shri P. Chidambaram, learned Senior Counsel, appeared for the

Resolution Professional in the Civil Appeals.
23.     Arguments on behalf of the appellants are summarised as follows:
The learned counsel appearing on both sides have advanced detailed

arguments on the sanctity of timelines under IBC and the Competition Act to

support their respective arguments on the combination approval as directory

or mandatory when the CoC is considering the resolution plans.
[Provided also that the eligibility criteria in Section 29-A as amended by the Insolvency and
Bankruptcy Code (Amendment) Ordinance, 2018 (Ord. 6 of 2018) shall apply to the resolution
applicant who has not submitted resolution plan as on the date of commencement of the
Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (Amendment) Ordinance, 2018.]
(5) The resolution applicant may attend the meeting of the committee of creditors in which the
resolution plan of the applicant is considered:","42.   Where the language is clear, plain and unambiguous, the courts are

      duty-bound to give effect to the meaning that can be inferred from a

      statute, irrespective of the consequences. Mere inconvenience being

      caused to a party, by virtue of the plain and literal interpretation

      accorded to a statute, cannot be reason enough to forego such

      interpretation.
67.   While literal interpretation must remain the judiciary’s guiding light,

      insights gained from legislative debates, committee reports and/or

      historical contexts may be looked at with a degree of caution, lest

      they obscure the plain meaning of the text or elevate subjective

      predilections of the judge above the clear mandate of the law. Such

      an inquiry into legislative history, therefore needs to be carefully

      undertaken as a supplement to but not as substitute of the literal

      interpretation of the statutory language, mindful of the risks of

      wandering too far afield into the uncertain waters of committee

      reports, memorandums and legislative debates.
68.   Let us now pay attention to the Report of the Insolvency Law

      Committee (dated 01.03.2018), which recommended that specific

      timelines be incorporated in the IBC, to seek approval from



                                    33 of 75
      government authorities as well as the CCI. The relevant extracts from

      the Report are as follows:
36 of 75
      However, the last line in the Memorandum states that the same is

      to clarify that the approval from CCI for the combination, shall be

      obtained prior to the approval of the Resolution Plan, by the

      Adjudicating Authority, instead of CoC, as mentioned in the

      preceding line and also the inserted proviso. A question might

      therefore arise – whether it was an inadvertent legislative error? As

      can be appreciated, the erstwhile Ordinance provided for a ‘post-

      Adjudicating Authority’ approval stage. The Memorandum clarified

      that a new step had been added at a ‘pre-Adjudicating Authority’

      approval stage. It would therefore be logical to hold that obtaining

      prior approval of the CCI before the CoC approval, would seamlessly

      cover the ‘pre-Adjudicating Authority’ approval stage without any

      possible disruption.
74.   The error as noticed above, appears to have been inadvertently

      made while drafting the Memorandum but this is not the case in

      the drafting of the statute. The particular line in the Memorandum

      could also be a Scrivener’s Error, a judicial doctrine developed in

      the USA, as put forth by Mr. Parag Tripathi, learned senior counsel

      for AGI Greenpac. This doctrine was explained by legal scholars in

      the following terms26:
77.   More importantly, such external aids of interpretation could have a

      limited role only when repugnancy within the statute fall for

      consideration. But that is not the situation here as the language of

      the statute is clear, specific and unambiguous.
42 of 75
      approval by CoC to such a deficient Resolution Plan can have no

      legal implications. In the present case, the CCI-unapproved

      Resolution Plan does not pass the muster. The same cannot be

      approved by this Court as it is in violation of Sections 30(2)(e),

      30(3), 30(4) and
34(4)(a)
of the IBC. It therefore does ‘contravene

      provisions of the law for the time being in force’.
93.   The point at which the applicant is allowed to give notice to CCI of

      a combination, i.e., the trigger event, need not therefore be limited

      to when the Resolution Plan is submitted to the Resolution

      Professional. On the contrary, such notice can be given immediately

      after or within thirty (30) days of the execution of ‘any agreement’


                                     45 of 75
       or ‘other document’, disclosing details of the proposed combination.
94.   The argument that the application to obtain approval from the CCI

      can only be submitted at the stage when the Resolution Plan is

      submitted i.e., T + 135 days, in the timeline would be erroneous and

      unacceptable. The application under the statutory scheme, can be

      submitted at various stages, including but not limited to, at the time

      of Expression of Interest i.e.., T + 60 days, or issuance of RFRP i.e.,

      T + 105 days, or even when the list of provisional Resolution

      Applicants is published i.e., T + 85 days. Taking this into account,

      submitting the combination proposal before the CCI at either of these

      stages, would have still resulted in the culmination of the entire

      process, within the stipulated time limit of 330 days, under the IBC.
97.   However, if notice for the proposed combination under
Section 6(2)
of

      the Competition Act has been given within the stipulated time and

      no dilatory tactics have been employed, the parties should not be

      held responsible for any delay on the part of the CCI, in examining

      the combination. The CCI, as their counsel Mr. Balbir Singh points

      out, has been able to approve bulk of the proposed combinations, in

      a time-bound and reasonable manner, as can be gleaned from the

      Annual General Reports and material placed on record, by Mr. Singh.
98.   In the present case, even though dilatory tactics are said to have

      been adopted in the submission of notice under the Combination

      Regulations, with Form II submitted on 03.11.2022, the combination

      was approved on 15.03.2023 i.e., within 132 days. The recent

      Competition (Amendment) Act, 2023 which reduced the timeline for

      approving combination proposal from 210 days to 150 days and

      requiring the CCI to give a prima facie opinion on the likelihood of a


                                     48 of 75
      combination causing an Appreciable Adverse Effect on Competition

      (AAEC) from 30 days to 15 days, is indicative of the more realistic

      and shorter timelines that the CCI ordinarily requires for its analysis

      and decision-making, pertaining to such combination proposals.
99.   Flowing from the above, it is difficult to interpret the provisions

      disjunctively, as has been done by the NCLAT, in the impugned order

      dated 18.09.2023.
51 of 75
       declaration of law or binding precedent, but simply implies that the

       case was not considered worthy of examination for a reason, other

       than on merits.37
123. Bearing in mind the above discussion, it appears that several

     procedural deficiencies have occurred in the approval process of

     the combination.
29. The procedural design mandates an expansive fact-finding

      mission, including consultation with stakeholders and detailed

      scrutiny, to ensure that the combination either withstands the

      muster of competitive fairness or is modified to avert any

      deleterious market impact.
136. In light of the voluntary modification proposed by the acquirer i.e.,

     AGI Greenpac, pursuant to
Regulation 25(1A)
of the Competition

     Commission of India (Procedure in Regard to the Transaction of

     Business Relating to Combinations) Regulations, 2011 [hereinafter

     referred   to   ‘Combination   Regulations’],   the   aforementioned
Regulation 25(1A)
unequivocally mandates that a voluntary

     modification submitted to the CCI, must bear the imprimatur of

     both parties to the combination, namely, the acquirer and the

     target. This statutory requirement is not just a procedural

     formality. It is in fact a substantive safeguard, designed to ensure

     that interests of all stakeholders are duly represented and

     protected. In the present matter, the proposed modification seeks

     the divestment of the Target's plant, a move that inherently

     attracts the provisions of the IBC. The active participation and

     explicit approval of the target company are indispensable pre-
137. Furthermore, the legislative intent underpinning
Regulation

     25(1A)
necessitates a holistic and inclusive approach to such

     modifications, particularly where the proposed measures, impinge

     upon the operational and structural integrity of the target

     company. The facts of this case underscore the criticality of this

     requirement, as the proposed divestment scheme is a vital

     component of the revival of the stressed target company under the

     resolution framework contemplated by the IBC.
138. As earlier noticed, the failure to issue a SCN under
Section 29(1)
to the Target Company/Corporate Debtor, constitutes a major

     procedural lapse with significant consequence. The statutory

     scheme of the
Competition Act
, as well as the synergistic

     framework of the IBC, demands that all parties to the combination

     are afforded a fair opportunity to participate in the decision-

     making process, particularly when the proposed measures bear a

     direct and material impact on their interests. The absence of such

     notice undermines the procedural sanctity of the modification

     process and renders the resultant approval susceptible to bona

     fide challenge.
143. Transparent and accurate data disclosures are fundamental to the

     regulatory mechanism. The identified discrepancies compromise

     the very basis of the CCI’s decision-making process. It is

     imperative   to   therefore    underscore   that   discrepancies   in

     operational capacity data would strike at the very root of the

     regulatory mechanism. While we do not intend to embark on a

     fact-finding expedition afresh, the prima facie inconsistencies in

     the submitted data ought to have been examined with greater care

     by the NCLAT. But this was not done. Consequently, the

     conditional approval should have been revoked, especially in light

     of the CCI’s express mention in its order (dated 15.03.2023) that

     the order may be revoked if the information provided by the


                                   68 of 75
     acquirer is found to be incorrect at any particular time.
144. Conditional approvals, by their very nature, necessitate rigorous

    and ongoing enforcement to ensure compliance with the prescribed

    conditions in both letter and spirit. For the AGI Greenpac-HNGIL

    combination,    the   absence   of      a   robust    and   comprehensive

    monitoring mechanism reveals a significant lacuna within the

    regulatory framework. Such deficiencies pose considerable risk of

    non-compliance or deliberate circumvention, thereby defeating the

    entire purpose of imposing these conditions. The systemic

    inefficiencies apparent in this instance highlight the existing

    fragility of conditional approvals when not accompanied with robust

    enforcement mechanisms.
148. As India aspires to establish itself as a global manufacturing

       powerhouse and investment hub, it is imperative that it is able to

       provide a reliable, robust and competitive business environment

       for both domestic and international stakeholders. In essence, the

       introduction of the Green Channel route, which strives to create a

       level-playing field and enable new entrants to effectively compete

       with established players in the Indian market, is a significant step

       in that direction. However, to ensure that entities operate with

       utmost confidence in the sanctity and fairness of India’s legal and

       regulatory system, the objectives of the IBC and the Competition

       Act must also necessarily be in harmony with one another.
150. In the present case, for reasons discussed above, the statutory

     provision   and   legislative   intent   unequivocally   affirm    the

     mandatory nature of the proviso to
Section 31(4)
of the IBC. For a

     Resolution Plan containing a combination, the CCI’s approval to

     the Resolution Plan, in our opinion, must be obtained before and

     consequently, the CoC’s examination and approval should be only

     after the CCI’s decision. This interpretation respects the original

     legislative intent, and deviation from the same would not only

     undermine the statute but would also erode the faith posed by the

     stakeholders in the integrity of our legal and regulatory framework.
152. Further, the indispensability of procedural safeguards as an

     integral component of a just legal order must be given its due

     weight, especially as procedural requirements are not mere

     formalities to be circumvented for expediency but substantive

     protections designed to ensure fairness and transparency. In that


                                 72 of 75
     light, the procedural lapses with respect to objections to the

     proposed    combination       and       the   consequent    divestiture

     modification proposed within the framework of the
Competition

     Act, 2002
, seriously vitiated the integrity of the process. It is

     therefore reiterated and reinforced that adherence to procedural

     propriety is non-negotiable and that the ends cannot justify the

     means.
155. The upshot of the above discussion are the following orders:
6.    On 26.09.2022, AGI Greenpac Limited (“AGI”) submitted the draft

resolution plan to the RP. The Appellant, Independent Sugar Corporation

Limited (“INSCO”) in Civil Appeal No. 6071 of 2023, is one of the resolution

applicants. INSCO received green channel combination approval on 30.09.2022

from the Competition Commission of India (“CCI”). In the e-voting of the

Committee of Creditors (“CoC”), Dt. 27.10.2022, the resolution plans of AGI
5
received 98% votes, and INSCO received 88% votes. The communication Dt.

28.10.2022 of the RP addressed to INSCO noted that AGI was declared as the

successful resolution applicant.
7.    On 27.09.2022, AGI applied to CCI in Form I for approval of the proposed

CIRP combination of taking over HNGIL. The said approval was rejected by CCI

on 22.10.2022. AGI, on 03.11.2022, applied to CCI in Form II for approval of

the proposed combination of taking over HNGIL through CIRP.



A.    PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE ADJUDICATING AUTHORITY
8.    On 05.11.2022, the RP moved the Adjudicating Authority for approval of

the decision of the CoC Dt. 27.10.2022, viz., declaring AGI as the successful

resolution applicant. On 14.11.2022, INSCO filed I.A. No.1497 of 2022 before

the Adjudicating Authority for setting aside the resolution plan approved by the

CoC in the e-voting Dt. 27.10.2022. The prayers in the applications filed by

INSCO read as follows:
9.    The gist of the objections of INSCO before NCLT is that the

communication of CCI Dt. 15.03.2023 approving the combination of AGI with

HNGIL cannot be taken on record. The communication Dt. 15.03.2023 is

subject to compliance with the modification offered by AGI. The approval of CCI

must be prior to the approval by the CoC. In other words, the approval of CCI

for the proposed combination is mandatory and available when the CoC

considers the resolution plan submitted by a resolution applicant. The ex post

facto approval was granted when the consideration under
section 31
of IBC was

pending before the Adjudicating Authority. The proviso to
section 31(4)
of IBC

is mandatory and not directory.
11.   On 15.03.2023, CCI approved the combination application of AGI with

HNGIL    with   a   few   conditions.   During   the   pendency   of    IA   (IB),

No.1497/KB/2022 filed by INSCO for rejecting the application filed for approval

of the minutes of the meeting Dt. 27.10.2022, AGI and the RP filed I.A.Nos.628

and 701/KB/2023 to place on record the combination approval order Dt.

15.03.2023 of CCI. The objection of INSCO proceeds that the proviso to
section
7
31(4)
mandates the resolution applicant to have prior approval of CCI on the

combination proposed through the resolution plan.
17.    The above excerpt defines the scope of controversy in the subject appeals.

The learned counsel appearing for the parties, in great detail, made

submissions on several aspects which are intrinsically pending consideration

before the Adjudicating Authority. The approach of NCLAT to the issues on

hand is adopted and the legality of NCLAT and the Adjudicating Authority’s

orders is examined.
23.10.   The condition to hive off the Rishikesh plant is not commensurate

         with the resolution plan of taking over HNGIL as a going concern.

23.11.   The statutory timelines under section 12 of the IBC and Regulation

         40A of the CIRP Regulations, 2016 are not deviated by insisting upon

         prior CCI approval.
24.3. The exclusive literal interpretation of the proviso to sub-section (4) of
section 31
and holding that it is mandatory would preclude or prevent

      the     participation   of   eligible    resolution   applicants.   This   would

      consequently provide a quick start to a resolution applicant having green
14
channel combination approval from CCI. Further, the object of

      maximising the value of stressed assets with the participation of a

      resolution applicant with green channel approval against a resolution

      applicant requiring a combination approval would diminish the

      competitive spirit of the CIRP and the value maximization of stressed

      assets. The submission of draft resolution plan by all the eligible

      applicants, dehors combination approval, would reflect on the potential

      asset realization. Competition in resolution plans, voting by CoC, and

      appreciation of feasibility and viability are all commercial facets

      interwoven with one another.
24.5. The CoC, by the statutory scheme, regulations and precedents, is

      conferred the discretion to decide only on the commercial viability or

      feasibility of the resolution plans submitted by the competing and eligible
15
resolution applicants and have the approval of the Adjudicating

      Authority.
24.17.   The respective statutory authorities can operate parallelly and

         harmoniously without stressing or straining the respective timelines.



         After hearing the learned counsel for the parties and perusing the

record, the question of law taken up for consideration is – whether the proviso

to sub-section (4) of
section 31
is mandatory or directory at the stage of

consideration of the resolution plan by the CoC?



IV.   POLICY UNDERLYING THE IBC
27.   The report recommended assessing the viability of a corporate debtor and

noted that the economic purview presented an advantage by calling for the

assessment of the viability of an enterprise or a project. An enterprise that has

fastened financial failure is considered as a viable enterprise and there is

possible financial re-arrangement that can earn the creditors a higher economic
22
value in contrast to shutting down such an enterprise. On the contrary, if the

cost of financial re-arrangement required to keep the enterprise going is higher

than the non-performance value of future expected cash flows, then the

enterprise is considered unviable or bankrupt and is better shut down as soon

as possible.
36.   The brief narrative of the working of the Code takes us to the point posed

for consideration in these appeals. The appellants commend the literal rule of

interpretation to the proviso and have laid much emphasis on the expressions

viz., “shall”, “prior to”, and “committee of creditors”. This argument applies the

golden rule of interpretation in establishing that the proviso is mandatory and

must be complied with before the stage of sub-section (4) of section 30, i.e.,

consideration of the resolution plan by CoC at the time of voting. The extended

argument is that a combination approved post the decision taken under section

30(4) of the IBC cannot be relied upon and taking on file the approval of

combination Dt. 15.03.2023 of CCI, as proposed by AGI, is an illegal exercise

of jurisdiction.
37.   The argument of literal construction, at first blush, appears to be simple

and available to the object sought to be achieved. The RP also acted contrary

to the law by bringing on record the approval of a combination of CCI proposed

by AGI.
45.   Literal interpretation is not the only tool to begin with while constructing

a statute. The often-cited judgements on literal interpretation set out when

purposive interpretation is considered and preferred over literal interpretation.

In the instant appeal, both interpretations have been commended for

consideration.
(i) the amount to be paid to such creditors in the event of a liquidation of the corporate debtor
under
Section 53
; or
(c) provides for the management of the affairs of the corporate debtor after approval of the
resolution plan;
54.   Reference to these external aids for interpreting the proviso under

consideration would arise only after completing the exercise of literal or

purposive interpretation.
The legislature, consciously, has not provided any ground to challenge

      the “commercial wisdom” of the individual financial creditors or their
39
collective decision before the adjudicating authority and is made non-
56.4. While the ultimate business decision lies with the CoC, such a decision

      should indicate adequate consideration of the objectives of the IBC.

      Accordingly, the adjudicating authority should ensure that the decision

      of the CoC takes into account the following factors: (i) the corporate

      debtor should continue as a going concern during the resolution process,
(ii) the value of assets of the corporate debtor should be maximised, and
56.6. The jurisdiction bestowed upon NCLAT is also expressly circumscribed.
57.   The admitted circumstances are that –
40
57.1. On 27.09.2022, AGI in Form I applied for approval of the combination of

      the subject resolution plan.
57.2. On 22.10.2022, the application in Form I was rejected by CCI.

57.3. On 27.10.2022, through e-voting, the CoC approved AGI’s resolution

      plan for HNGIL.
63.1.     The CoC approves a resolution plan by a vote of not less than sixty-six

          per cent of the voting share of the financial creditors.

63.2.     The CoC ascertains the feasibility and viability of a resolution plan and

          also the manner of distribution of priorities.
64.     It is noteworthy that sub-section (4) of section 30 of the IBC

conspicuously does not refer to the checklist prescribed in sub-section (2) of

section 30 of the IBC. By law and precedent, the CoC, while exercising its

commercial wisdom, is required to assess the feasibility, viability and

prioritisation of interests. In its commercial wisdom, nothing prevents the CoC

from appreciating the fallout of non-compliance with combination approval by

one of the resolution applicants. This circumstance may influence the voting

pattern of the CoC. However, it cannot result in the rejection of a non-compliant

resolution plan.
65.     The duties and functions of the Adjudicating Authority under
section 31
of IBC are as follows.
75.    The question as to whether a requirement under the statute is mandatory

or directory depends upon the intent of the legislature and not upon the

language in which the intent is clothed. The meaning and intention of the

legislature must govern, and these are to be ascertained not only from the

phraseology of the provision but also by considering its nature, its design, and

the consequences which would follow from construing it one way or the other.15
3.       AGI Greenpac Limited (“AGI”) and Indian Sugar Corporation Limited

(“INSCO”) were prospective resolution applicants in the corporate insolvency

resolution process (“CIRP”) ordered by the NCLT in Case No. CP (IB) 369/2020.

The resolution professional (“RP”) issued the request for resolution plan

(“RFRP”) Dt. 24.05.2022. The RFRP stipulates in Clauses 2.6.3(c), 3.3 and

4.1.1(k) that the approval of the combination by the Competition Commission

of India (“CCI”) is available before the Committee of Creditors (“CoC”) considers

the resolution plan. Considering the financials and market share of HNGIL, the

rigour of combination as defined in
section 5
of the Competition Act is attracted
2
to the proposal of AGI since it has a substantial presence in the relevant market

in India.
Sections 5
and
6
of the Competition Act set out the combination and

regulation of combinations. To wit, it is noted that the resolution applicants to

the RFRP Dt. 24.05.2022 who are in the manufacture and supply of glass

containers similar to the activities of HNGIL are informed to have the approval

of the combination of the proposed resolution plan before the CoC considers

the feasibility and viability of the resolution plan.
4.    If the proposal of the resolution applicant contributes to horizontal or

vertical relationships, then the requirements of
sections 5
and
6
of the

Competition Act are attracted, and due compliance is necessitated.
7.    INSCO and AGI fall within the purport of Clauses 2.6.3(c), 3.3 and

4.1.1(k) of the RFRP. On 27.09.2022, AGI filed Form I with CCI under

regulation 5(2) of the Competition Commission of India (Procedure in regard to

transaction   of   business   relating   to   combinations)   Regulations   2011

(“Combination Regulations 2011”) intimating the proposed combination of AGI

and HNGIL as part of CIRP. On 30.09.2022, INSCO, a foreign player, applied

in Form I for combination approval under the green channel for the proposed

combination in the CIRP of HNGIL and received deemed approval vide notice

C-2022/09/974. The UP Glass Manufacturers Syndicate (“UPGMS”), Appellant

in Civil Appeal No.4054/2023, filed objections before the CCI to the Form I

application made by AGI on 27.09.2022. On 13.10.2022, CCI directed AGI to

file a notice in Form II in terms of
Regulation 5(5)
of the Combination

Regulations 2011. On 27.10.2022, the CoC approved AGI’s resolution plan by

98% vote through e-voting.
9.    CCI, upon forming a prima facie opinion that the proposed combination

of AGI with HNGIL is likely to cause appreciable adverse effect on competition

(“AAEC”) in the relevant market in India, decided to issue a show cause notice

to AGI. On 10.02.2023, CCI issued a show cause notice under
section 29(1)
of

the Competition Act to AGI to show cause as to why an investigation in respect

of the proposed transaction should not be carried out. On 10.03.2023, AGI

replied to the show cause notice Dt. 10.02.2023 and voluntarily offered to hive

off or divest the Rishikesh Plant upon approval of the resolution plan by the

Adjudicating Authority under the IBC. This was followed by further

clarifications of AGI on 14.03.2023. CCI, on 15.03.2023, approved, under
section 31(1)
of the Competition Act, the modified combination of AGI.
11.   AGI and HNGIL are engaged in the manufacture and supply of glass

containers. The activities of HNGIL and AGI involve both horizontal and vertical

relationships. The CCI delineated the relevant product market as container

glass packaging and noted the operation and existence of both wholesale and
5
retail segments by AGI and HNGIL. The CCI appreciated the combined market

share of HNGIL and AGI in the delineated relevant market as – (i) Alco-Beverage

(40-50%) and (ii) F&B (80-85%). The combined effect of AGI and HNGIL is noted

as significant players in the Alco Beverage and F&B Sector. The combination is

likely to have significantly increased the level of concentration in the relevant

market for container glass. Further, the countervailing power of the buyers is

limited in the market, and imports seem to be marginal in the relevant market

of the proposed combination. Moreover, the “failing firm” defence that a delay

in acquisition would adversely affect the viability of the target was rejected, and

a holistic approach to the assessment of the proposed transaction was applied,

which involved accepting and balancing structural changes in the combination

details. It is contextual to note the following clauses in the modification plan

Dt. 10.03.2023 and 14.03.2023. The important features of the modification to

the suggested combination are stated thus:
1.  Whether the Appellant(s) have locus   The NCLAT noted that the

Abhishek Manu Singhvi, Shri Dushyant Dave and Shri Balbir Singh for the

appellants.
(4)The Commission may, [within seven days] from the expiry of the period specified in sub-section
(3), call for such additional or other information as it may deem fit from the parties to the said
combination.
24.   Reverting to the circumstances of the case, AGI, in its response to the

show cause notice Dt. 10.02.2023, replied and suggested modification to the

combination vide communication Dt. 10.03.2023 and 14.03.2023. The case of

both AGI and CCI is that CCI’s regulatory jurisdiction for deciding on the

approval of a combination was satisfied with the reply/modification suggested,

resulting in the combination approval Dt. 15.03.2023. The argument of the

appellants is that once a show cause notice is issued under
section 29(1)
, CCI

should have called for a report from the Director General. This argument is

untenable and rejected accordingly. Therefore, passing an order of approval to

the proposed combination without further steps of investigation on the

proposed combination of
section 29
of the Competition Act is legal.
25.   The admitted case of all parties is that the CCI accepted a reply and

modified proposal on 10.03.2023, determining no further investigation was

necessary. The core legal dispute centers on
section 29(1)
of the Competition

Act and its procedure, specifically the phrase “is likely to cause or has caused

appreciable adverse effect on competition within the relevant market in India"".

The CCI initially issued a show cause notice, a preliminary investigative step

requiring parties to justify why an in-depth examination of the proposed

combination should not be conducted. The jurisdictional nuance lies in the

Commission's requirement to form a prima facie opinion before compelling a

response,   which   involves   carefully   assessing   whether   the   proposed

combination might substantially impact competitive dynamics.
19
26.   The procedural violation pointed out is that on the receipt of the response

from AGI, the report of the Director General is not called for and no

investigation is ordered by CCI. As part of statutory regulation, if it were to be

the object and intention of the Parliament to call for a report from the Director

General in every case where the prima facie opinion is formed, then the further

steps, namely, issuing show cause notice and receiving response would not

have been contemplated.
If the plural expression on a case-to-case basis is understood as singular, then

it would restrict the meaning of the language. Hence, the findings recorded by

the NCLAT are affirmed. It is a matter of record that the RP, taking note of the

approval of the combination proposed by AGI, filed an application before the

Adjudicating Authority on 08.04.2024 for taking on file the approval of the

combination and in the pending issues under
section 31
of IBC. Whether the

non-issuance of notice to the RP is a ground available to the appellants to

challenge the approval of the combination is yet another question which is not
23
considered and decided by the NCLAT. In the circumstances of the case, the

findings recorded on this behalf, particularly, at the instance of the appellants

herein.
36.   The appellants argue that CCI's consideration of AGI’s data is inaccurate

or lopsided. CCI consists of experts and specialists in different branches of

trade, commerce and technology. The consideration by the experts, as rightly

noted by NCLAT, must be given due weightage. In an appeal under
section 53T
of the Competition Act, the data details need not be reconsidered, and findings

need not be recorded on whether the proposed combination has AAEC in the

relevant market in India. The counsel appearing for the objectors tried to point

out the TPD taken note of by CCI and the capacity of HNGIL and AGI. AAEC,

as determined by the CCI, considers the product outflow from the acquirer and
25
the target. These factors determined the market share and AAEC in the relevant

market in India. Established, installed or consented capacities are permissions

held by a business entity. From the permission granted for higher capacity,

AAEC is not appreciated until the capacity is used to the maximum by the

enterprise. There is no ground to re-examine the issues in fact. The

consideration and conclusion recorded by CCI, as confirmed by NCLAT, are

affirmed; consequently, the appeals are dismissed.","126. The CCI was obligated to issue an appropriate SCN to both the

     acquirer and the target.       The term ‘to the parties to the

     combination’ cannot be restricted to the proposed acquirer alone.

     The finding of the NCLAT on this aspect is therefore not to be

     faulted.
145. Furthermore,    conditional    approvals       are    fundamentally   ill-

    equipped to mitigate the risks that manifest during the interim

    period, preceding the full implementation of remedial measures.

    The underlying assumption that post-approval remedies will rectify

    present market distortions, fails to account for the practical

    challenges and complexities associated with enforcing such

    remedies, retroactively. This approach creates an enforcement lag

    that can result in significant and potentially irreparable harm to the

    competitive landscape and the interests of the stakeholders. The

    temporal gap between the grant of approval and the implementation


                                 69 of 75
    of effective remedies fosters a regulatory vacuum, thereby

    exacerbating the likelihood of anti-competitive conduct, during this

    transitional phase. The failure to mitigate present risks undermine

    the efficacy of conditional approvals and their intended regulatory

    objectives.
12.   The adjudicating authority vide order Dt. 28.04.2023 dismissed IA (IB)

No.1497/KB/2022 filed by INSCO. By the order of even date, I.A. Nos. 628 and

701/KB/2023 were allowed to the extent of placing on record the CCI’s

communication Dt. 15.03.2023.
prior to approval by the CoC is mandatory. The

                  other aspects of the approval of the resolution plan

                  is since pending adjudication of the Adjudicatory

                  Authority, we need not express any opinion on other

                  submissions raised by the parties”.
23.9.    CCI’s conditional combination approval of AGI on 15.03.2023 implies

         that unless the condition is complied with, there is no combination

         approval by CCI in favour of AGI.
(2) The resolution professional shall examine each resolution plan received by him to confirm
that each resolution plan—
31
(iii) interests of all stakeholders are balanced.

56.5. In the event that the adjudicating authority, on a review of the facts of

      the case, concludes that the aforesaid factors have not been considered,

      it may send the resolution plan back to the CoC but not alter the

      resolution plan of its own accord.

JANUARY 29, 2025.
I.       BACKGROUND
10.   The combination was approved vide order Dt. 15.03.2023 and was

challenged before the NCLAT by a few aggrieved parties. NCLAT, through the

order Dt. 28.07.2023, impugned in the civil appeals, dismissed the appeals and

confirmed the combination approved by CCI. Hence, the civil appeals.



II.   THE GIST OF CCI ORDER DT. 15.03.2023
from non-application of mind?

17.         CCI filed four appeals against the findings recorded by the NCLAT on the

legal obligation to issue notice to both parties to the combination and not just

the acquirer under
section 29(1)
of the Competition Act. Hence, the batch of

civil appeals against the order Dt. 28.07.2023.
(5)The additional or other information called for by the Commission shall be furnished by the
parties referred to in sub-section (4) [within ten days] from the expiry of the period specified in
sub-section (4). (6) After receipt of all information and within a period of forty-five working days
from the expiry of the period specified in sub-section (5), the Commission shall proceed to deal
with the case in accordance with the provisions contained in
section 31
.
17
23.2. The commission shall issue a notice to show cause to the parties to the

      combination, calling upon them to respond within thirty days of receipt

      of the notice.
Cumulative effect of the above reasoning is that

                 the Commission would be a necessary and/or a

                 proper party in the proceedings before the

                 Tribunal.”

 NEW DELHI;
JANUARY 29, 2025
Page 2 of 2","3.   Combining with HNGIL is AGI Greenpac Ltd. [hereinafter referred

     to as ‘AGI Greenpac’] i.e., the Successful Resolution Applicant,

     which is the second largest company in the field of glass packaging

     and manufacturing in India, after HNGIL. With two manufacturing




                                    3 of 75
     plants in Telangana, AGI Greenpac is the leading manufacturer of

     container glass. The combination between AGI Greenpac and

     HNGIL, with potential market share of 80-85% in F&B segment

     and 45-50% in alco-beverage segment, is generating a key issue

     for adjudication since the combination of the two major players in

     this sector is likely to result in an Appreciable Adverse Effect on

     Competition [hereinafter referred to as ‘AAEC’] in the glass

     packaging industry generally and in particular, within the sub-

     segments of F&B and alco-beverages.
4.   The main contesting party to the aforementioned proposed

     combination is the Bermuda-registered Appellant – Independent

     Sugar Corporation Ltd. [hereinafter referred to as ‘INSCO’],

     incorporated in 1984, which also submitted their Resolution Plan

     for HNGIL – the Corporate Debtor/Target Company in India.
5.   After the CIRP was initiated against HNGIL by DBS Bank

     [hereinafter referred to as ‘Financial Creditor’] under
Section 7
of

     the IBC, the Adjudicating Authority i.e., National Company Law

     Tribunal (Kolkata Bench), admitted the matter on 21.10.2021. An

     Expression of Interest [hereinafter referred to as ‘EOI’] was floated

     on 25.03.2022, by the Resolution Professional as per Form G

     under Regulation 36(A)(1) of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board

     of India (Insolvency Resolution Process for Corporate Persons)




                                 4 of 75
     Regulations, 2016. Within the EOI, Clauses 3.3 & 4.1.1(k)

     prescribed a mandatory requirement of approval from the

     Competition Commission of India [hereinafter referred to as ‘CCI’]

     prior to the approval of the Resolution Plan, by the Committee of

     Creditors [hereinafter referred to as CoC’].
6.   In response to the above, both INSCO (Appellant) and AGI

     Greenpac submitted their respective Resolution Plans in April

     2022, for consideration. On 19.05.2022, a provisional list of

     eligible Resolution Applicants was published with both the

     Resolution Applicants placed at Sl. No. 6 (INSCO/Appellant) and

     Sl. No. 5 (AGI Greenpac/Respondent 2), respectively.
21.6. The locus standi for Appellants as the unsuccessful resolution

      applicant is questioned, as they lack vested rights in the CIRP. It

      is also argued that the workmen and operational creditors have

      no standing to challenge a Resolution Plan.
30.   A few paragraphs from the impugned NCLAT order being relevant

      are extracted herein below:
119. Before delving into the substantive aspects of the Competition law,

     the relevant facts and procedural trajectory that lead to the

     present appeal needs to be referred. Upon AGI Greenpac’s Form I



                                58 of 75
     submission on 27.09.2022, the CCI found the information

     submitted to be insufficient and directed them to file a detailed

     Form II. On 15.03.2023, the CCI approved the proposed

     combination, predicated upon voluntary modifications offered by

     AGI Greenpac, including the divestment of an HNGIL plant located

     in Rishikesh, to mitigate the Appreciable Adverse Effect on

     Competition (AAEC).
128. Apart from mandating the issuance of a SCN to the concerned

     parties, upon the formation of a prima facie opinion that the

     combination in question warrants investigation, the statutory

     obligations in the form of
Sections 29(2)
to
29(6)
outline the


                                61 of 75
      consequential steps, aimed at gathering comprehensive data from

      not just the acquirer and the target company, but also from other

      stakeholders, potentially impacted by the combination. The

      legislative wisdom embedded within these provisions attempts to

      recognise the ripple effects of the existence of an Appreciable

      Adverse Effect on Competition in a market, which would transcend

      the immediate parties to the transaction, thereby necessitating a

      broader consultation and data collection process.Hrishikesh Roy, J.
FACTUAL MATRIX
1.      These are statutory appeals under
Section 62
of the Insolvency

        and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 [hereinafter referred to as ‘IBC’]

        against the judgement dated 18.09.2023 (impugned order) passed


                                                 2 of 75
     by the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal [hereinafter

     referred to as ‘NCLAT’] in appeals, pertaining to the Corporate

     Insolvency Resolution Process of the Hindustan National Glass

     and   Industries   Ltd.    [hereinafter    referred   to    as   ‘HNGIL’].

     Additionally, there is a set of appeals arising out of the NCLAT

     Order dated 28.07.2023, pertaining to the approval accorded to

     the combination between HNGIL and AGI Greenpac. In this

     common judgment, the parties are identified from Civil Appeal No.

     6071 of 2023.
7.   Subsequently, in response to an e-mail by the Appellant seeking

     clarification with respect to the timeline for obtaining approval of

     CCI, the RP in an e-mail communication dated 25.08.2022,

     granted   relaxation to Resolution Applicants, to procure CCI

     approval, after CoC’s approval of the Resolution Plan but prior to

     filing the application before NCLT.
8.   On 27.09.2022, AGI Greenpac submitted an application with the

     CCI under Form I under
Regulation 5(ii)
of the Competition

     Commission of India (Procedure in Regard to Transaction of

     Business relating to Combination) Regulations 2011 intimating

     that it proposed to enter into a combination with HNGIL, by



                                 5 of 75
     acquiring 100% of HNGIL’s shareholding and business.
11. However, on 28.10.2022, the CoC approved the AGI Greenpac’s

     Resolution Plan with 98% votes, while Appellant INSCO’s



                                 6 of 75
     Resolution Plan, received 88% votes.
12. Thereafter, on 03.11.2022, AGI Greenpac submitted a detailed

     application (Combination Registration No. C-2022/11/983) under

     Form II seeking approval before CCI. At the same time, the

     Resolution Professional filed an IA under Section 30(6) of the IBC

     before NCLT Kolkata, seeking approval for AGI Greenpac’s

     Resolution Plan while INSCO filed an IA before NCLT Kolkata

     challenging the approval granted to AGI Greenpac’s Resolution

     Plan, by the COC.
16. Meanwhile, the Appellant INSCO challenged the CCI approval

     dated 15.03.2023 vide Competition Appeal (AT) No. 7/2023 before

     the NCLAT, which upheld the approval vide judgement dated

     28.07.2023.

DISCUSSION & ANALYSIS

                    Objections on Locus Standi
28.     In these matters, the principal issue is whether the approval of a

        proposed combination by the CCI must mandatorily precede the

109. The question of obtaining approval from the CCI did not arise
in that

       case
, as the acquisition in question, did not qualify as a

       ‘combination’ under the
Competition Act, 2002
. Consequently, the

       legal principles concerning the necessity of CCI approval and the

       implications of such approval, particularly in cases involving the

       possibility of an AAEC, were not addressed or analysed in that

       decision. This was challenged before a two-Judge Bench of this

       Court which found no reason to interfere and dismissed the Appeal

       at the threshold, vide Order dated 06.08.2021.
Procedural Lapses under the Competition Act
1.    The captioned appeals arise from the common order Dt. 18.09.2023 of

the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal, Principal Bench, New Delhi

(“NCLAT”) under
section 62
of the IBC read with the
Insolvency and Bankruptcy

Amendment Act, 2018
. Civil Appeal No.4924 of 2023 and connected appeals

arise from the order Dt. 28.07.2023 of the NCLAT, and the controversy in these

appeals arises under the
Competition Act, 2002
(“
Competition Act
”).
2.    The two sets of appeals have been tagged and heard together. The

appeals, for convenience, are disposed of by separate judgments having regard

to the nature of issues of fact and law.18.   Dr. Abhishek Manu Singhvi, learned senior counsel for INSCO

      i.e., the unsuccessful Resolution Applicant. (Appellant in Civil

      Appeal       No.   6071/2023),   inter   alia,   made   the   following

      submissions:
21.5. Moreover, since there was no change in AGI Greenpac’s

      Resolution Plan, it was argued that Plan is not conditional. In any

      case, these issues should not be entertained by the Supreme

      Court at this premature stage, as these are pending for

      consideration before the NCLT.
22.   Mr. Parag Tripathi, supplementing for AGI Greenpac, invoked the

      Principle of Scrivener’s Error, highlighting an inadvertent drafting

      error in the proviso to
Section 31(4)
of the IBC that rendered


                                15 of 75
      unclear the original legislative intent. It is therefore argued that

      courts can pierce through the alleged obvious error and discern

      the true purpose behind the enactment.
66.   To further fortify that the proviso has been interpreted as above in

      the correct manner, an analysis of the context in which and the

      intent with which the proviso to
Section 31 (4)
of the IBC was brought

      into effect, guides us further:
81.   It is for the above reasons that the legislature has devised a scheme



                                    40 of 75
      wherein the Resolution Plan with its proposed modifications must

      be placed before the COC to enable it to compare all possible plans

      of prospective Resolution Applicants. Only then can the CoC’s

      commercial wisdom be exercised assiduously.

      Union31, as well as
Indore Development Authority v. Manoharlal.32
90.   In that context, the timeline of 210 days as stipulated under the
Competition Act
would be attracted only in cases which involve an

      extremely high degree of AAEC, mostly indicative of a complicated

      super-monopolistic behemoth. In fact, it must be borne in mind

      that CCI itself in its Annual General Report for the year 2022–2023

      stated that the average time required to dispose of combination

      applications, is usually 21 working days. There has been no

      recorded instance till date where, more than 120 days were taken

      by the CCI to approve a combination proposal. Additionally, of the

      99 combination proposals approved by the CCI, an overwhelming

      85 of those were approved within 30 days and the rest 14 approvals

      took less than 120 days in toto. Therefore, the extreme and rare

      examples projected by the counsel for AGI Greenpac and CoC need

      not be given undue importance, in the present interpretative

      exercise.
However, only one such combination proposal has been received in

      the past few years.
140. Mr. Rajshekhar Rao, learned senior counsel, had highlighted

     material discrepancies in the operational capacity data furnished

     by AGI Greenpac and HNGIL, including but not limited to:

S.V.N. BHATTI, J.
10.   AGI contended that the requirement in the proviso to
section 31(4)
of the

IBC is directory and not mandatory. The combined reading of
section 31
of IBC

with
section 6(2)
of the Competition Act would stipulate that the statutory

compliance of combination must be available when a decision is taken on the

proposal of the resolution applicant by the Adjudicating Authority. Thus,

praying for the rejection of IA (IB) No.1497/KB/2022 filed by the RP.
19.     Dr. Abhishek Manu Singhvi, Shri Mahesh Jethmalani, Shri Rajshekhar

Rao and Shri Dhruv Mehta, learned Senior Counsel, have appeared for the

appellants.
20.     Shri P. Chidambaram, learned Senior Counsel, appeared for the

Resolution Professional in the Civil Appeals.
23.     Arguments on behalf of the appellants are summarised as follows:
The learned counsel appearing on both sides have advanced detailed

arguments on the sanctity of timelines under IBC and the Competition Act to

support their respective arguments on the combination approval as directory

or mandatory when the CoC is considering the resolution plans.
[Provided also that the eligibility criteria in Section 29-A as amended by the Insolvency and
Bankruptcy Code (Amendment) Ordinance, 2018 (Ord. 6 of 2018) shall apply to the resolution
applicant who has not submitted resolution plan as on the date of commencement of the
Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (Amendment) Ordinance, 2018.]
(5) The resolution applicant may attend the meeting of the committee of creditors in which the
resolution plan of the applicant is considered:9.   On 22.10.2022, CCI declared the application filed by AGI Greenpac

     as ‘not valid’. Thereafter, final Resolution Plans were submitted for

     consideration by the CoC. It must however be noted that at that

     stage, neither AGI Greenpac’s Resolution Plan had the requisite

     CCI approval nor did they have any pending application, seeking

     such approval from the CCI.
13. On 10.03.2023, AGI Greenpac submitted a divestment plan to CCI

     in respect of one of the seven HNGIL plants (situated in

     Uttarakhand), as part of a voluntary modification, to comply with

     the requirements of Competition laws. On 15.03.2023, CCI

     granted an approval to AGI Greenpac’s combination proposal with

     HNGIL (Corporate Debtor/Target Company), subject to the

     compliance of certain modifications including the divestment of

     one of the seven HNGIL plants (Rishikesh, Uttarakhand).
14. Challenging the approval to HNGIL and AGI Greenpac’s Resolution

     Plan and seeking reconsideration of INSCO’s Resolution Plan,

     INSCO filed an application before NCLT Kolkata. On 28.04.2023,

     the NCLT rejected the application, thereby upholding the approval

     granted to AGI Greenpac’s Resolution Plan, stating that the



                                7 of 75
     required CCI approval under
Section 31(4)
IBC had been obtained

     in the meantime. While challenging the NCLT rejection dated

     28.04.2023, the Appellant filed the Company Appeal (AT)

     (Insolvency) No. 735/2023 before the NCLAT.
15. The NCLAT vide judgment dated 18.09.2023 upheld the approval

     accorded to AGI Greenpac’s Resolution Plan, stating that although

     the requirement of approval by the CCI was mandatory in nature,

     its prior approval by the CoC, was only directory. This is because

     the timeline for CCI to decide upon a combination proposal is

     much longer and should not lead to a situation where the CIRP is

     frozen or halted because of a pending application before the CCI.
17. It is these above decisions of the NCLAT (dated 28.07.2023 and

     18.09.2023) that have been challenged by INSCO in the lead Civil

     Appeal. Arguments in support of INSCO’s stand have been

     advanced by learned Senior Advocates Dr. A. M. Singhvi and Mr.

     Mahesh Jethmalani. On the other side, the Successful Resolution

     Applicant i.e., AGI Greenpac is represented by learned Senior

     Advocates Mr. Mukul Rohatgi and Mr. Parag Tripathi. The learned



                                8 of 75
      Solicitor General Mr. Tushar Mehta, appears for the CoC. The

      learned Senior Advocate Mr. P. Chidambaram appears for the

      Resolution Professional while the CCI is represented by learned

      Senior Advocate Mr. Balbir Singh. For the other parties,

      submissions were advanced by learned Senior Advocates Mr. Rana

      Mukherjee, Mr. Dushyant Dave, Mr. Amit Sibal, Mr. Dhruv Mehta,

      Mr. Neeraj Kishan Kaul and Mr. Rajshekhar Rao.
19.   Appearing for the CoC, Mr. Tushar Mehta, the learned Solicitor

      General, inter alia, made the following submissions:
103. Also in that case, the CCI’s approval did not address issues relating

     to a potential Appreciable Adverse Effect on Competition (AAEC) in

     the relevant market. The approval so granted by the CCI did not

     impose any modifications to the Resolution Plan either. On the other

     hand, the present case involves substantive concerns regarding an

     Appreciable Adverse Effect on Competition (AAEC), which required

     CCI’s careful consideration and proposed modifications if any, to

     ensure compliance with appropriate laws.
118. What is also of great relevance is that after the COC’s approval,

     the Resolution Plan cannot be modified in any manner since the

     Adjudicating Authority can only approve the Resolution Plan, as

     has been approved by the CoC. This is made clear by
Section 31(1)
of the IBC.
120. Vide its Order dated 28.07.2023, the NCLAT upheld the CCI’s

     conditional approval, holding that the voluntary remedies

     sufficiently mitigated competitive concerns and that the absence

     of notice to HNGIL did not vitiate the approval, especially given the

     RP’s non-objections.
131. In the present matter, the procedural sanctity prescribed under

     the   scheme   has   been    regrettably   disregarded,   with   the

     Commission failing to solicit inputs from public, affected

     stakeholders and those likely to be affected by such combination

     under
Section 29(2)
. This omission not only contravenes the

     statutory intent but also diminishes the transparency and

     inclusivity that underpin the review mechanism for combinations.

     The legislative scheme unambiguously envisions an investigation

     that encompasses a wide array of stakeholders, as combinations

     inherently possess the potential to reshape market dynamics in

     ways that ripple across the competitive landscape.
3.    DBS Bank, as a financial creditor, moved an application under
section 7
for Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (“CIRP”) before the National

Company Law Tribunal, Kolkata Bench (“Adjudicating Authority”) against

Hindustan National Glass and Industries Limited (“HNGIL”), the corporate

debtor. On 21.10.2021, the Adjudicating Authority admitted the application
3
filed under
section 7
against HNGIL. Mr. Girish Sriram Juneja, respondent

No.1, is the Resolution Professional (“RP”).
21.     Shri Tushar Mehta, learned Solicitor General appeared for the Committee

of Creditors.
24.15.   An interested resolution applicant to whom the requirement of

         approval in Form II of CCI is attracted ought not to be disqualified

         from consideration by the CoC in spite of such an applicant satisfying

         the eligibility criteria stipulated by the CoC. On the one hand, the

         scheme in the proviso to subsection (4) of
section 31
clearly delineates

         a condition precedent to an adjudication order under
section 31(2)
of

         the IBC and, on the other hand, the main body of
section 31(4)
provides for obtaining ex post facto permissions within one year under

         different enactments.
53.   Learned counsel appearing for the parties have made a few submissions

on the scope and applicability of external aids, such as the memorandum and

explanatory note appended to the amending Act. For continuity, the

memorandum and the notes on clauses are excerpted hereunder:
6.    On 18.08.2022, INSCO sought clarification from the RP on the

combination approvals and the RP, by reply e-mail Dt. 25.08.2022, informed

INSCO that CCI’s approval could be obtained after the approval of the

resolution plan by CoC but prior to the filing of the resolution plan before the

Adjudicating Authority.
8.    On 03.11.2022, AGI filed notice in Form II before the CCI for the approval

of a combination of the successful resolution plan. On 17.11.2022, CCI sought

additional information/documents from AGI. AGI, through the reply Dt.
4
08.12.2022, responded to the queries raised by the CCI. On 19.12.2022, AGI

filed the additional submissions/material before the CCI.
9.   Whether order of the Commission         Natural justice principles are
     dated 15.3.2023 can be said to          followed when there are civil
     have been passed in violation of        consequences. There is no
     principles of natural just since the    entitlement given to other
     objections filed by Appellant the       persons other than those
     U.P. Glass Manufacturers Syndicate      given notice to participate in
     even after the order dated              the proceedings. The filing of
                                             objections happens under
10
22.02.2024 were not duly
Section 29(2)
, and since the
              considered?                           stage had not arisen, UPGMS
                                                    cannot claim violation of
                                                    natural justice.
19.9. Shri Balbir Singh, appearing for CCI, argued against the findings

      recorded on the need to issue notice to parties, i.e., the acquirer and the
13
target. He also argued to sustain the orders of CCI and NCLAT in so far

      as the approval of the combination is concerned.
20.   Shri Mukul Rohatgi, the learned Senior Counsel appearing for AGI,

principally made his submissions to sustain the orders of CCI and NCLAT,

particularly by relying on the relevant portions of the respective orders. He

argued on the locus standi of appellants to challenge the order Dt. 15.03.2023

of CCI. The arguments are summed up as follows:2.   One key party in this matter is HNGIL i.e., the Corporate

     Debtor/Target Company with a 60% market share of the glass

     packaging   industry      in   India.    The   Resolution    Professional

     represents them. Incorporated in 1946, HNGIL has manufacturing

     plants located in Bahadurgarh (Haryana), Rishra (West Bengal),

     Neemrana (Rajasthan), Naidupeta (Andhra Pradesh), Sinnar

     (Maharashtra), Puducherry and Rishikesh (Uttarakhand), catering

     to a wide range of industries, including pharmaceutical and

     wellness, cosmetics, food & beverage, and alco-beverages, etc.
10. Immediately thereafter, the Appellant objected to the approval

     accorded to AGI Greenpac’s Resolution Plan stating that they had

     not obtained the requisite CCI approval at the time, when their

     Resolution Plan had been put to vote, which had been the

     condition precedent. The Appellant also pointed out that Form I

     submitted by AGI Greenpac with the CCI had been rejected on

     22.10.2022 and that a fresh Form II had been submitted which

     had not yet been approved till the date of the COC approval.

     Further, serious contradictions between the process undertaken

     and the process envisaged to be undertaken by the RP in an e-mail

     clarification dated 25.08.2022, were also highlighted to point out

     that preferential treatment had been granted to AGI Greenpac

     despite the rejection of their Form I, by the CCI.
21.    For the Successful Resolution Applicant i.e., AGI Greenpac Ltd.,

      Mr. Mukul Rohatgi, learned Senior Advocate, inter alia, made the

      following submissions:
26.   Once the CIRP is initiated, the nature of proceedings are no longer

      in personam but rather become in rem. In light of the same, the



                                16 of 75
        expression ‘any person aggrieved’ in the context of the IBC has

        been held to be indicative of there being no rigid locus

        requirements to institute an appeal challenging an order of the

        NCLT before the NCLAT or an order of the NCLAT before this

        Court.1 Similarly, in the context of the
Competition Act
, even

        those persons that bring to CCI information of practices that are

        contrary to the provisions of the
Competition Act
, could be said

        to be ‘aggrieved’.2 Therefore, the term ‘any person aggrieved’

        appearing in
Section 62
of the IBC and
Section 53T
of the

        Competition Act must be understood widely and not in a

        restricted fashion.
27.     In the present case, the Appellant as an unsuccessful resolution

        applicant whose Resolution Plan could have otherwise been

        approved by the CoC, satisfies the requirement of being aggrieved.

        This preliminary locus standi objection vis-à-vis the Appellant,

        therefore, does not merit acceptance.
29.   In its impugned order dated 18.09.2023, the NCLAT concluded

      that while the approval of the CCI for the combination is

      mandatorily required in consonance with the proviso to
Section

      31 (4)
of the IBC, the timing of such approval i.e., that it must be

      obtained prior to the approval of the Resolution Plan by the COC,

      should be construed as being ‘directory’ in nature, rather than

      ‘mandatory’.
38.   The principle of casus omissus, as articulated by this Court in
Ebix

      Singapore (P) Ltd. v. Educomp Solutions Ltd. (CoC
)5, underscoring

      boundaries of judicial interpretation, cautions the courts against

      transgressing into the legislative domain. The courts should not

      arrogate the legislature’s role by filling gaps in statutory text.

      Statutory enactments like the IBC demand strict adherence to

      legislative intent, guarding against procedural overreach that may

      upset the framework envisioned by the Parliament.
39.   Likewise, the Supreme Court in multiple cases had underscored the

      rule that when the language of a statute is plain and unambiguous

      and reasonably susceptible to only one meaning, there cannot be a

      question of construction of the statute, as the provision would speak

      for itself.6
40.   In an oft-quoted case on literal interpretation Kanailal Sur v.
Paramnidhi Sadhu Khan, this Court stated as follows7:
9
Mahalaxmi Mills Ltd., Bhaunagar v. CIT, Bombay
, 1963 SCC OnLine SC 190;
Nasiruddin

 v. State Transport Appellate Tribunal
, (1975) 2 SCC 671; Precision Steel and Engineering
 Works v. Premdeva, (1982) 3 SCC 270.
48.   When the statute is clear and straightforward, the Supreme Court in
Bhavnagar University v. Palitana Sugar Mill Private Limited15
held as

      follows:
49.   Lord Atkinson in Corp. of the City of Victoria v. Bishop of Vancouver

      Island16 observed:
50.   That words in the statute are to be understood in their natural,

      ordinary and popular sense. This has been underscored by Justice

      Frankfurter, in the following opinion:
53.   The legislative intent behind inserting the proviso to
Section 31(4)
of

      the IBC would suggest that prior approval of the CCI was specifically

      mandated and it should not be seen as a flexible provision to be

      ignored in certain exigencies. In fact, a contrary interpretation of the

      said proviso, i.e., that the prior approval is directory, would distort

      the objective for which the legislature inserted the proviso, thereby



  17 Wilma E. Addison v. Holly Hill Fruit Products, 322 US 607.
54.   In the present interpretive exercise, one also needs to be mindful of

      the legal principle which says that where a statute requires one to

      do a certain thing in a certain manner, it must be done in that

      particular manner or not done at all. For this proposition, it would

      be relevant to extract the following from the judgment in
A. R.

      Antulay v. Ramdas Sriniwas Nayak18
:
57.   The learned Solicitor General appearing for the CoC, had suggested

      the interpretation by which the requirement of obtaining prior

      approval from the CCI should be construed as directory. But this

      would inevitably require the Court to interpret the said proviso to

      mean something different than what has been expressly mentioned

      in the proviso. The following decisions of this Court which support

      the present proposition are reproduced for ready reference:
58.   In Sri Venkataramana Devaru v. State of Mysore, the Supreme Court

      held19:
59.
In
Hardeep Singh v. State of Punjab
, this Court held the following20:
60.   Significantly, the Supreme Court in Visitor, Aligarh Muslim

      University v. K.S. Misra21 held:
22 Quebec Railway, Light, Heat & Power Co. v. Vandry, SCC OnLine PC 10; ESI Corpn. v. KEY

 DEE Cold Storage Pvt. Ltd., (2022) 17 SCC 379; UOI v. Hansoli Devi, (2010) 15 SCC 483.
30 of 75
       used by the legislature and should avoid the assumption that the

       legislature by inserting the proviso, using certain words at certain

       places and/or not using particular words at all, committed a

       mistake.
62.   It must be presumed that the legislature inserted every word in a

      provision for a purpose and that every part of the statute should have

      effect as well.23 In that context, in situations wherein there is no

      ambiguity with respect to the provisions of a statute, the Court’s

      interpretative exercise would be restricted. In other words, the Court

      is duty-bound to proceed on the footing that the legislature intended

      what it expressed in the statute (or proviso, in this case). Beyond that,

      the Court’s exercise cannot be stretched to involve a re-writing, re-

      casting or re-framing of the legislation or statute.
63.   In that light, while interpreting
Section 2(2)
of the Arbitration and

      Conciliation Act, 1996, a Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court

      observed that in case the legislature intended to expand the scope of
Part-I of the Act
to arbitrations seated in foreign countries, it would

      have added such words in the provision itself. Therefore, for the

      Court to add words that are not expressly provided by the legislature

      in the statute itself would tantamount to a ‘drastic and unwarranted

, 1960 SCC OnLine

 SC 16;
Dilawar Balu Kurane v. State of Maharashtra
, (2002).2 SCC 135;
Ramphal Kundu v.
 Kamal Sharma
, (2004) 9 SCC 278.
64.   Rules of interpretation permit courts to read a certain word, term or

      phrase in the statute differently from its plain meaning if it leads to

      absurdity but the courts must always remain conscious of the fine

      dividing line, separating adjudication and legislation, which must

      not be crossed.
In
Vemareddy Kumaraswamy Reddy v. State of A.P.25
,

      the Court in the context held as follows:
65.   In the present case, the use of the word ‘prior’ at the appropriate

      place in the proviso besides being direct, clear and unambiguous

      also does not lead to any absurd consequences. The proviso to
Section 31(4)
of IBC mentions that the approval to the Resolution

      Plan from CCI shall be obtained ‘prior’ to its approval by the CoC.

      vis-à-vis the CCI’s approval. In case of other statutory bodies, a

      timeline of one year subsequent to the CoC’s approval of the

      Resolution Plan was deemed to be sufficient, whereas the timeline

      for procuring the CCI’s approval was brought ahead in the sense

      that the same was required to be obtained prior to the approval of

      the Resolution Plan, by the COC.

                “In the literal sense, then, a “scrivener’s error” is a
                mistake of transcription, which is to say a mismatch
                between original (e.g., spoken word, manuscript) and
                copy. Today, of course, Congress does not use actual
                scriveners. Indeed, the phrase “scrivener’s error” came
                into popular usage only once reliance upon scriveners
                was uncommon. The phrase is thus a term of art, referring
                to a particular sort of legislative mistake. Specifically, and
                as explained more fully throughout Part I, a “scrivener’s
                error” is a case in which the words of a legislative text
                diverge from what Congress meant to say. Such a case
                contrasts with one in which Congress simply should have
                said something else.”
75.   Assuming that there is no such error in the Memorandum and

      therefore the Memorandum presents a conflicting view vis-à-vis the

      Notes on Clauses in explaining the legislative intent behind

      introducing the said proviso, the implication thereof can be

      understood from the following passage from the three Judge Bench

      opinion in a similar context.
In
Shashikant Laxman Kale v. Union of

      India
, the Court opined27 that the final Act would be the guiding

      factor:
76.   Additionally, it is not necessary to refer to Memorandum explaining

      particular clauses of a Bill when the language of the provision is

      clear and unambiguous, as has been held in
ACG Associated

      Capsules v. Commissioner of Income Tax28
. In any case, a

      Memorandum explaining a particular proviso stands at a lower

      footing when compared with Notes on Clauses, explaining the entire

      amendment, especially in cases where the language in the statute

      is definite and straightforward. In fact, the Memorandum does not

      even feature in the Hindi version of the Bill whereas the Notes on

      Clauses elaborately explaining the intent behind introducing each

      amendment, features prominently in both the English and Hindi

      versions. This would also indicate that the Memorandum can never

      play the decisive role.

      approval of the CCI before the approval of the Resolution Plan, by

      the COC. This provision introduced with straightforward and clear

      words must be interpreted and understood as being mandatory in

      nature. Otherwise the object behind the enactment of the said

      proviso, would be defeated.
82.   To decide whether a particular provision should be identified as

      mandatory in nature, we may benefit by referring to the following

      precedents:
83.
In
Sharif-ud-Din v. Abdul Gani Lone
, the Supreme Court held29 as

      follows:
84.   The long-standing principle of the consequence of non-compliance

      being the determinative factor, was later reaffirmed in several

      judgments, such as
Patil Automation Pvt. Ltd. v. Rakheja Engineers

      Pvt. Ltd.30
,
Mackinnon Mackenzie & Co. Ltd. v. Mackinnon Employees
29 (1980) 1 SCC 403.
85.   Earlier, emphasising on the consequence theory to understand the

      binding nature of the statute, Justice K. Subba Rao in his majority

      opinion in
State of U.P. v. Babu Ram Upadhyaya33
, held as follows:
32 (2020) 8 SCC 129.
33 1960 SCC OnLine SC 5.
87.   On the aspect of a possible disharmony between the stipulated

      timeline to be followed under the IBC and the Competition Act, the

      NCLAT in the impugned order has held the proviso to
Section 31(4)
of the IBC, to be directory in nature since mandatory prior approval

      of the CoC, would lead to disruption in the CIRP timeline, as

      stipulated under the IBC.
95.   On the upper limit of 330 days within the CIRP timeline, it has been

      pertinently this Court in
Committee of Creditors of Essar vs. Satish
46 of 75
    Kumar Gupta observed the following34:
Distinguishing cases relied upon by the NCLAT
100. The NCLAT in its analysis placed heavy reliance on the decision of

      the three-judge bench of the NCLAT in Arcelor Mittal India Pvt. Ltd.

      v. Abhijit Guhathakurta35. However, this reliance is misplaced, as the

      factual and legal context of that case materially differs from the

      present matter.
101. For instance, the CIRP in Arcelor commenced prior to the

      introduction of the proviso to
Section 31(4)
of the IBC. The NCLT, in

      Arcelor, explicitly held that the proviso could not be applied

      retrospectively, given that it imposed an additional procedural

      obligation requiring resolution applicants to furnish CCI approval,

      prior to submitting a Resolution Plan. As such, the amendment was

      deemed inapplicable to the CIRP initiated before the enactment of

      the proviso. In contrast, the CIRP in the present case was initiated


  35 2019 SCC OnLine NCLAT 920.
102. In fact, if we look at the impugned NCLAT reasoning it can be noticed

     that the NCLT in Arcelor implicitly mentioned that the clear change

     in procedure i.e., obtaining the prior approval of the CCI, has to be

     implemented prospectively. However, this additional procedural

     obligation cannot be imposed retrospectively in that particular case.
104. Importantly, the Arcelor judgment lacks detailed reasoning or

     analysis by which the NCLAT concluded that the proviso to
Section

     31(4)
is only directory. Further, this judgement was also not

     challenged before this Court. Consequently, its precedential value in

     the present context is limited, and it cannot be relied upon to

     determine the issues arising in this appeal.
106. Further, it does not also discuss the object behind the IBC or the

     introduction of the proviso. In fact, the CCI approval in Makalu does

     not pertain to a situation where a prima facie opinion regarding the

     existence of an AAEC was formed. The absence of such consideration

     underscores the limited relevance of the decision to the present

     matter where, significant issues pertaining to both the IBC and

     Competition law have been raised, requiring a thorough examination

     of the CCI's observations and the implications of its approval.
107. As such, the precedential value of Makalu is insufficient, to support

     the NCLAT findings in the present matter, although Makalu’s

     decision was challenged before this Court and was dismissed vide

     Order dated 12.10.2020, as not involving any substantial question

     of law. However, it is well-settled that the dismissal of an SLP in

     limine without giving any detailed reasons do not constitute any



  36 2020 SCC OnLine NCLAT 643.
108.
Besides, Vishal Vijay Kalantri v. Shailen Shah38
was also relied on by

       the NCLAT, which again is entirely misplaced as the factual and legal

       circumstances
in that case
differ fundamentally from the present

       matter. On the issue of the proviso to
Section 31(4)
of the IBC being

       directory in nature, Vishal Vijay Kalantri merely follows the earlier

       discussed and discarded ratio, in Arcelor Mittal.
110. Therefore, the impugned NCLAT order incorrectly relied upon the

       aforementioned NCLAT decisions. Being distinguishable, those




  37 Supreme Court
Employees’ Welfare Association v. Union of India
, (1989) 4 SCC 187; State
  of Orissa v. Dhirendra Sundar Das, (2019) 6 SCC 270.
  38 2020 SCC OnLine NCLAT 1013.
52 of 75
   decisions could not have been unreservedly applied, to the present

   matters. Reliance on those decisions in different context, both on

   facts and on law, would lead to an erroneous interpretation on the

   applicability of the proviso to
Section 31(4)
of the IBC.
116. In any case, it is well-settled that the Resolution Professional does

       not possess any adjudicatory powers under the IBC.39 In fact, the

       role of the Resolution Professional, as a facilitator of the CIPR, is

       almost entirely administrative in nature. Therefore, the Resolution

       Professional, not being an adjudicating authority, could not have

       mandated that the requirement of obtaining prior approval of the

       CCI before placing the Resolution Plan before the NCLT, can be

       relaxed. Granting such relaxation on a whim, oddly enough

       through an e-mail in the present case, was in our opinion beyond



39
Swiss Ribbons Pvt. Ltd. v. Union of India
, (2019) 4 SCC 17.
- a term, denoting premature or unauthorised consummation of a

     transaction, prior to obtaining mandatory approvals from the CCI.
130. A compelling aspect of this statutory scheme is the deliberate use

      of the term ‘investigation’ in
Section 29
, contrasting sharply with

      ‘inquiry’ as employed in Section 26, which pertains to anti-

      competitive agreements and abuse of dominant market position.

party audits or independent verifications, creates loopholes for the

     circumvention of regulatory conditions. For example:
Further, such a conditional approval can foster uncertainty,

       prolong negotiations, and necessitate further modifications,

       thereby putting at peril the sanctity of the resolution framework.41


                                     CONCLUSION
149. Within that context, while the IBC’s primary objective is the timely

       resolution of stressed assets with maximised value realisation for

       the stakeholders, the significant delay seen in the present case is

       both unfortunate and regrettable. Nevertheless, expeditious

       resolution cannot come at the cost of disregarding statutory

II.   BACKGROUND
4.    Annexure B of the expression of interest (“EoI”) lays down the eligibility

criteria for the prospective resolution applicants to satisfy. The relevant criteria

are reproduced below:

B.    PROCEEDINGS BEFORE NCLAT
13.   The order Dt. 28.04.2023 was challenged before the NCLAT by the

following parties, and details are stated thus:
14.   INSCO assails the order of the Adjudicating Authority Dt. 28.04.2023

that the reliance placed on Arcelor Mittal India Pvt. Limited vs. Abhijit

Guhathakurta, Resolution Professional of EPC Constructions India Limited &
8
Ors.1 is erroneous, and according to the ratio in
Bank of Maharashtra vs.

Videocon Industries Ltd.,2
the approval of CCI prior to CoC considering the

resolution plan is mandatory. The words “shall” and “prior to the approval of

such resolution plan by the committee of creditors” in the proviso to
section

31(4)
of the IBC require that the approval of combination is available while the

CoC considers the resolution plans attracting combination set out in
section 5
of the Competition Act.
16.   The NCLAT, by the impugned common order, dismissed the appeals.

16.1. The impugned order in paragraph 19 notices the scope of controversy

      considered and decided by NCLAT as follows:

III.   PROCEEDINGS IN THIS COURT
18.    The civil appeals at the instance of the appellants in the impugned order

are as follows:
22.     Shri Mukul Rohatgi and Shri Paras Tripathi, learned Senior Counsel

have appeared for AGI Greenpac Ltd.

A.      ARGUMENTS ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
23.14.   The Court, while interpreting, shall not legislate or change the law

         which clearly reflects the will of the Parliament. The reliance on
13
Arcelor Mittal (supra) is erroneous and illegal, even if these decisions

            are confirmed by this Court in the Civil Appeal(s).
B.    ARGUMENTS ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
20
24.16.   The RP, CoC and the resolution applicant are bound by the timelines

         stipulated under the IBC. The timely performance of a duty or

         function by CCI is not in the hands of a resolution applicant who

         applied for approval of a combination before CCI. The consideration

         by the CCI depends on products, nature of the industry, area and

         dominance in the market. The CCI, as a regulatory authority, ensures

         fair competition even after a combination is brought into existence.

         For the said purpose, the inquiry under
section 20
of the Competition

         Act is complied with by CCI.
29.   The IBC, thus, seeks to replace the existing framework on insolvency and

bankruptcy, which is enumerated below:
Under this Act, the Board of Industrial and Financial Reconstruction

        assesses the viability of the industrial company and refers an unviable

        company to the High Court for liquidation. SICA 1985 stands repealed.



V.      SCHEME OF INSOLVENCY AND BANKRUPTCY CODE, 2016

aims:

Committee of Creditors of

Essar Steel India Limited Through Authorised Signatory v. Satish Kumar Gupta
and others,3 wherein it was held that the outer limit for the completion of CIRP

was 330 days, which may be extended by the adjudicating authority in

exceptional cases where the delay in litigation could not be attributed to the

parties.

VI.   ANALYSIS
27
39.
In
Madhav Rao Scindia vs. Union of India,4
it has been held that the

simpler and more common the word or expression, the more meanings and

shades of meaning it has. As already noted, apparently clear and simple

language in its comprehensive analysis is so ambiguous at times that it

presents difficulty in understanding its meaning, requirement, and purport.
40.    In Commissioner of Income Tax, Orissa vs. NC Budhraja and Co.,5 it is

held that a statute cannot always be construed with the dictionary in one hand

and the statute in the other. Regard must also be had to the scheme, context,

and legislative history.                                   (emphasis supplied)
41.    In Corp of the City of Victoria vs. Bishop of Vancouver Island,6 the

celebrated judgment, Lord Atkinson stated: “In the construction of statutes,

their words must be interpreted in their ordinary grammatical sense, unless

there be something in the context, or in the object of the statute in which they

occur, or in the circumstances in which they are used, to show that they were

used in a special sense different from their ordinary grammatical sense. The

literal interpretation leads to hardship, inconsistency or obstruct the

accomplishment of the object of the statute steps in. In other words, the

doctrine of purposive interpretation is taken recourse to for the purpose of

giving full effect to the statutory provisions and the Courts must state what

meaning the statute should bear rather than rendering the statute in nullity.

A statute must be construed in such a manner as to make it workable.


4 AIR (1971) SC 530 at Page 577.
5 AIR (1993) SC 2529 at Page 2540.
6 (1921) AC 2 384.
28
42.    In a few cases, the Courts have declined to be bound by the letter when

the letter frustrates the patent purposes of the statute. Ld. Justice J.C. Shah

in
New India Sugar Mills Ltd. v. Commissioner of Sales Tax, Bihar
, 7 noted that

“it is a recognized rule of interpretation of statutes that the expressions used

therein should ordinarily be understood in a sense in which they best

harmonise with the object of the statute, and which effectuate the object of the

Legislature”. The limitation of the purposive role of construction is that the

interpretation shall not result in legislation by the Court. Hardship,

inconvenience, injustice, absurdity and anomalous results are avoided while

construing the statute they need be.
43.    Lord Shaw in Shannon Realities Ltd. v. St. Michel (Ville De),8 notes that

“[w]here words of a statute are clear, they must, of course, be followed but in

their Lordships' opinion, where alternative constructions are equally open that

alternative is to be chosen which will be consistent with the smooth working of

the system which the statute purports to be regulating; and that alternative is

to be rejected which will introduce uncertainty, friction or confusion into the

working of the system”.
(emphasis supplied)
44.    T. L. Venkatarama Aiyyar, J in
Tirath Singh vs. Bachittar Singh,9
stated

that “where the language of a statute, in its ordinary meaning and grammatical

construction, leads to a manifest contradiction of the apparent purpose of the

8 (1924) AC 185.
9 AIR (1955) SC 830.

(i) where a resolution plan has not been approved or rejected by the Adjudicating Authority;
(iii) where a legal proceeding has been initiated in any court against the decision of the
Adjudicating Authority in respect of a resolution plan;]
(emphasis supplied)
55.
In
Essar Steel India Limited
(supra), this Court considered the scope and

ambit of section 30(2) and (4) on the one hand and also the jurisdiction of the
36
Adjudicating Authority/NCLAT under sections 30(4),
31
and
60(5)
of the IBC

on the other hand. The relevant paragraphs read thus:
56.   This Court has held that CIRP under the IBC is based on a flexible model

where market participants (as resolution applicants) can propose solutions for

the revival of the corporate debtor. To put it succinctly, the ratio of
Essar Steel
(supra) can be understood as follows:
38
justiciable.
57.4. On 03.11.2022, AGI applied to CCI in Form II for approval of the

      combination.
57.5. On 15.03.2023, CCI approved the combination with a few conditions.
41
66.1.
In
Gurudevdatta VKSSS Maryadit v. State of Maharashtra,12
this Court,

       while dealing with
section 27(3)
of the Maharashtra Co-operative

       Societies Act, 1960, held that words must be given their due meaning in

       their grammatical sense:
76.    The use of the word ‘shall’ raises a presumption that the particular

provision is imperative. However, the prima facie inference about the provision

being imperative may be rebutted by other considerations, such as – the object,

scope of the enactment, and the consequences flowing from such construction.

The interpretation of the word ‘shall’ as directory has been a purposive effort of

the court to sustain the object of the statute and, at the same time, ensure

compliance with the requirements. This Court has interpreted ‘shall’ as

directory to preserve the legislative effort and intent of the statute.

76.1.
In
Sainik Motors v. State of Rajasthan,16 State of UP
v.
Babu Ram

       Upadhya,17 and State of MP v. Azad Bharat Finance Co.,18
this Court has

       held that the word ‘shall’ does not always imply that a provision is




15 Earl T. Crawford, The Construction of Statutes (Thomas Law Book Company, 1940), p. 516.
16 AIR (1961) SC 1480
17 AIR (1961) SC 751
18 AIR (1967) SC 276
60
mandatory. If the legislative intent or the context requires the statute to

       be not mandatory, then the word ‘shall’ is to be contextually interpreted.

76.2. This Court has also held that the ultimate rule in construing auxiliary

       verbs like ‘may’ or ‘shall’ is to discover the legislative intent without giving

       it a controlling or determinative effect. The subject matter, the purpose

       of the provisions, the object intended to be secured by the statute which

       is of prime importance, and the actual words employed have to be

       considered in determining the nature of the obligation cast by the statute

       while employing ‘shall’ or ‘may’.19
77.    In determining whether the word ‘shall’ is mandatory or directory, the

court examines noscitur a sociis20, the operation, functions, duties, and

consequences for non-performance. The rule of literal interpretation with its

exceptions is noted, and the grammatical interpretation of sections 30 and
31
of IBC sets the stages of consideration of twin approvals – one by the CoC, and

the other by the Adjudicating Authority – while approval or rejection is granted

to the resolution plan. The combination approval as an enclosure to an

applicable resolution plan at the stage of section 30(4) of the IBC is a form or

procedure that does not have consequences. At the same time, the combination

approval to an applicable resolution plan at the stage of consideration of the

Adjudicating Authority under
section 31(1)
and (2) of the IBC becomes

substantial. This is because, a non-compliant resolution plan can be rejected


19
Bachahan Devi v. Nagar Nigam, Gorakhpur
(2008) 12 SCC 372
20 The meaning of words should be identified by reference to other words in the context of which

they appear.
81.   It is argued that the NCLAT in ArcelorMittal (supra),
Vishal Vijay Kalantari
(supra) and
Makalu Trading Limited
(supra) held that the requirement under

proviso to sub-section (4) of
section 31
is directory at the stage of CoC approval.
The view of that NCLAT was confirmed by this Court in
Vishal Vijay Kalantari
(supra) and
Makalu Trading Limited
(supra) while referring to the NCLAT

judgement in ArcelorMittal (supra). The argument of the appellant is that the

confirmation of a view taken by the NCLAT, as above, is either distinguishable
63
or alternatively cannot be treated as a binding precedent for deciding the

controversy in these appeals. In reply, it is argued that the NCLAT has

considered the crux of the issue in these matters and the Civil Appeal(s) that

stood dismissed has the effect of a binding precedent on the question of whether

the proviso to sub-section (4) of
section 31
of the IBC is mandatory or directory.

The absence of a reasoned dismissal order is no reason to re-open an otherwise

established position of law. To appreciate the consideration by NCLAT and

confirmation by this Court, the narrative is presented as follows:
82.   The tabular statement takes note of the conclusions stated by the NCLAT.

The argument against the view taken by this Court in
Vishal Vijay Kalantari
(supra) and
Makalu Trading Limited
(supra) is rejected.

82.1. In matters of trade, industry, and commerce, continuity and consistency

      in precedents are the foundations on which prudent business decisions

      are made. The consistent view in case law enables the market players to

      arrange affairs in compliance with the law and the precedents. In the

      working of the IBC, it does not appear that the only certainty is that

      nothing is certain. The resolution applicant is not to be subjected to

      intolerable uncertainty or not knowing what comes next. While doubt is

      not a pleasant condition, the adjudicatory process should not multiply

      it. The object of IBC is to provide the institutional framework for

      theoretical resolution without considering liquidation as the first option.

      The buoyant economy needs absorption mechanisms to prevent

      collateral and cascading impact on the investors, depositors and

      financial creditors. Therefore, the idea of the IBC is to let the financial

      markets work.
84.    On 05.11.2022, the RP moved for approval under section 30(6) of the IBC

for the resolution of the CoC Dt. 27.10.2022. INSCO, on 14.11.2022, filed

application No. 1497/2022 to reject AGI’s resolution plan for want of CCI

approval. Further consideration by the Adjudicating Authority is paused

because of an interlocutory application, an appeal to the NCLAT, and the

subsequent proceedings in this Court. The resolution plans were submitted

with the contemporaneous perspective of the physical state of affairs of men,

machinery and matters of the corporate debtor. The delay loses the very sheen

in the effort to revive the stressed assets of a corporate debtor. The law provides

for availing legal remedies. It may not be understood as laying down that the

interlocutory applications are not maintainable before the Adjudicating

Authority and NCLAT. Parties are well within their competence to move an

application, including further statutory remedies under IBC in accordance with

law. The outcome must be met with consequences and costs for the

unsuccessful parties. The consequences of delay must also be borne in mind.
In
State Bank of India & Ors. vs. The Consortium of Murari Jalan and Florian

Fritsch & Anr.,21
this Court held CIRP cannot be endlessly postponed, including

under the garb of litigation. This
Court further held
that the completion of CIRP

is imperative to avoid value erosion. The failure of the resolution process will

67
finally result in the sale of scrap of the assets of the corporate debtor, and

again, a scenario experienced under previous regimes is reflected. It is

axiomatic,   more   particularly   in   commercial   matters,    that   costs   and

consequences of adjudication follow the event. In corporate and commercial

matters, as a corollary, the cost must follow the result. Hence, costs are

awarded while dismissing the appeals and are to be credited to the account of

the RP.

JUDGEMENT

S.V.N. BHATTI, J.
2.       On 21.10.2021, the National Company Law Tribunal, Kolkata Bench

(“NCLT”) admitted CP (IB) 369/2020, an application filed by DBS Bank under
section 7
of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (“IBC”) against

Hindustan National Glass and Industries Limited (“HNGIL”). HNGIL is the

corporate debtor engaged in manufacturing and supplying glass containers.

HNGIL admittedly has a substantial market presence in the relevant market in

India.
5.    INSCO is a multinational company headquartered in Bermuda. It is

engaged in consulting for agriculture, financial management, and business

consultancy. AGI is engaged in manufacturing and supplying glass containers

and has a substantial market share in the relevant market in India. The actual

percentage of market participation of any of the parties is not noted as part of

the narrative on the background circumstances. The parties to the appeal are

in agreement that having the combination approval from CCI for the proposed

resolution plan is attracted to both AGI and INSCO. The distinction in

compliance format is that AGI must follow the Form II process for obtaining the

approval of CCI for the proposed resolution plan; on the contrary, INSCO, not

being a player in the relevant market in India, is subjected to the simple and

straight forward procedure, also known as green channel, contained in Form I.

this Court held that:
Commission is an expert body which had been

                 created   in   consonance    with    international

                 practice. The Court observed that it might be

                 appropriate if two bodies are created for

                 performing two kinds of functions, one advisory

                 and regulatory, and the other adjudicatory.
Though the Tribunal has been constituted by the
Competition    (Amendment)    Act,    2007
,   the

                 Commission continues to perform both the

                 functions stated by this Court
in that case

                                                            [S.V.N BHATTI]

NEW DELHI;20.1. It was argued that the RP adhered to the law and followed NCLAT


                                  13 of 75
      judgments correctly treating the proviso to
Section 31(4)
of the

      IBC, as directory.
20.2. According to Mr. Chidambaram, RP’s role is procedural, with no

      substantive involvement in Resolution Plans. Therefore, there is

      no scope for controversy regarding the RP’s role.
compliance with the proviso, Mr. Rohatgi argues that the proviso

      should be deemed as directory.
21.7. Highlighting the RP’s lack of expertise in managing a glass

      furnace factory, Mr. Rohatgi emphasised upon the importance of

      concluding the CIRP swiftly to avoid jeopardising its survival.
23.   At the outset, the preliminary objection regarding the locus standi

      of the Appellant(s) to prefer the present Appeal(s) must be dealt

      with.
24.
Section 61
of the IBC provides the statutory framework for

      appeals against orders of the Adjudicating Authority i.e., the

      NCLT, stipulating that ‘any person aggrieved’ by such an order

      may prefer an appeal to the Appellate Authority i.e., the NCLAT

      in this case. Further,
Section 62
extends this right of appeal to

      the Supreme Court.
25.   Similarly,
Section 53B
of the Competition Act provides that ‘any

      enterprise or any person aggrieved’ within the statutory

      framework may file an appeal against any order of the CCI to the

      Appellate Tribunal i.e., the NCLAT.
Section 53T
further extends

      this right of appeal to the Supreme Court against any decision or

      order of the NCLAT.
Proviso to
Section 31(4)
IBC
17 of 75
      the proviso to
Section 31 (4)
of IBC.
31.   The NCLAT, as can be seen from the above, concluded that though

  CCI’s approval is mandatory, obtaining ‘prior approval’, is directory.

  Such a conclusion was reached on the understanding that the

  Resolution Applicant does not have control over the timeline within

  which the CCI may render its approval or disapproval, towards the

  combination application. This may in turn, lead to a situation

  wherein the insolvency proceeding is unduly delayed because of a

  pending application seeking approval from the CCI. That might

  undermine the very objective of the Corporate Insolvency Resolution

  Process [hereinafter referred to as ‘CIRP’] itself. The absence of any

  explicit statutory consequences for non-compliance with the proviso

  to
Section 31(4)
IBC was therefore interpreted by the NCLAT as an

  indication that the requirement for prior approval was meant to be

  only directory.
32.   The proviso to
Section 31(4)
of the IBC was inserted by the
Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (Amendment) Act, 2018
. Post-

  amendment, the provision reads thus:
33.   A proviso in a given statute may be introduced to serve various

      purposes, like qualifying or excepting certain provisions from the

      main enactment or insisting on certain mandatory conditions to be

      fulfilled in order to make the enactment workable or as an optional

      addenda to explain the real intendment of the statutory provision.3

      Ordinarily, however, the function of a proviso is to except something

      out of the enactment or to qualify something enacted therein.
34.   The introduction of a proviso, specifically addressing those

      Resolution Plans with provisions for combination, and the use of the

      term ‘prior’ therein, makes it starkly clear that the intent of the

      legislature was to create an exception. This ensures that in cases

      containing combination proposals, the approval of the CCI i.e., the

      regulatory body designated to ensure fair competition in markets and

      preventing anti-competitive practices, should first be obtained before

      the same is approved by the CoC. No other provision of the IBC has

      been pointed out that might suggest otherwise or cause disharmony

      between the scheme and intent of the IBC or the said proviso to
Section 31(4)
of the IBC.
35.   The above provision makes it abundantly clear that the proviso

      herein creates an exception for those Resolution Plans that contain

      provisions for combination. The language used therein appears to be

      clear, precise & straightforward. As such, to understand the

      legislative intent, the Rule of Plain Reading or literal interpretation

      should find favour rather than the rule of purposive interpretation

      as is suggested by the other side.
36.   It has been strongly argued by Mr. Mukul Rohatgi, the learned

      counsel for AGI Greenpac, that the rule of purposive interpretation

      should be adopted in order to interpret the proviso to
Section 31(4)
of the IBC. He, in fact, suggests a departure from the principles of

      literal interpretation. However, the proposition of law is well-settled

      that when the language of the provision is clear and unambiguous,

      literal interpretation is the best way to understand the legislative

      intention behind enacting the particular provision.
41.   In fact, if the statute is plain and unambiguously-worded, the

      consequences of such construction no longer remain a matter for the

      court to decide on8, even if they appear to be strange, surprising,

      unreasonable, unjust or oppressive.9 Further, even hardship,

      inconvenience or penalty10 being the consequence of compliance with

      such construction cannot be deemed sufficient to alter the meaning

      of the language employed by the legislature, if such meaning is clear

      on the face of the statute or the rules.11
43.   Emphasising on construing the meaning from the plain language of
Section 123(7)
of the Representation of the People Act, 1951, as it



 8
Tamil Nadu State Electricity Board v. Central Electricity Regulatory Commission
, (2007) 7

 SC 636.
51.   The above pronouncements make it clear that when the words used

      are clear, plain and unambiguous, the courts are duty-bound to give

      effect to the meaning emerging out of such plain words. The intention

      of the legislature must be gathered from the language used and also,

      the words not used. It becomes imperative to understand those

      words in their natural and ordinary sense, and any interpretation

      requiring for its support addition or substitution or rejection of words

      as meaningless, must ordinarily be avoided.
52.   Courts must always attempt to uphold a provision as it is and not

      invalidate it, merely because one of the possible interpretations could

      lead to such a result. When there is no ambiguity in the words used,

      the question of finding a disguised intention or purpose behind the

      use of a particular word (the word ‘prior’ in this case), would not

      ordinarily arise.
55.   The language of the proviso to
Section 31(4)
of the IBC appears to be

      clear with no ambiguity and in those situations, all words finding

      place in the provision must be given their due meaning.
56.   The efforts must therefore be to construe any text, phrase and/or

      proviso in a reasonable manner without going beyond the limited

      range of permissibility within which the legislative meaning can be

      captured. The use of the word ‘prior’ in the proviso, must be given

      some meaning as by virtue of the same, the statute requires that the




  18 (1984) 2 SCC 500.
28 of 75
      act of obtaining CoC approval for the Resolution Plan must be done

      in a particular manner i.e., the necessary CCI approval for

      Resolution Plans containing combination proposals must be

      obtained prior to such Plan, being granted the CoC’s approval.
61.    The intent of the legislature must therefore be gathered from the

       words it has used in the statute. Naturally, the Court should proceed

       with the assumption that no word has been used in vain or in an

       inapposite manner, by the legislature.22 Courts, when confronted

       with clear statutory language, derive the meaning from the words


 21 (2007) 8 SCC 593.
32 of 75
      Therefore, to interpret the specific word to mean that such an

      approval can be obtained even ‘after’ and not necessarily ‘prior’ to

      the approval by the CoC would amount to reconstructing a statutory

      provision, which is not permissible.
70.   The statute, as can be observed, provided a different threshold for

      the CCI’s approval as compared to approvals to be received from

      other statutory and regulatory bodies. Such arrangement appears

      to be deliberate as the
Competition Act
contains both specific

      restrictions with respect to combinations that may lead to an

      Appreciable Adverse Effect on Competition (AAEC) in the relevant

      market as well as a detailed procedure of enquiry and scrutiny of

      such combinations, to prevent such AAEC. Based on the same, the

      CCI is empowered to either approve, reject or modify such a

      combination or to mould it in a manner that is in consonance with

      the scheme of the
Competition Act
.
Notes on Clauses, Memorandum & Scrivener’s Error
71.   Let us now consider another aspect which is brought forth by the

      learned counsel to indicate the legislative intent of the IBC. This is

      in reference to the Notes on Clauses to the Insolvency and

      Bankruptcy Code (Amendment) Act, 2018 which might have some




                                   35 of 75
      significance for the present discussion. The Notes on Clauses read

      as follows:
Justice Antonion Scalia, Common Law Courts in Civil Law System: The Role of United States
 Federal Courts in Interpreting the Constitution and Laws, A Matter of Interpretation: Federal
 Courts and the Law, 3 (Amy Gutmann, ed., 1997).
78.   The legislative intent in the proviso to
Section 31(4)
IBC, is in clear

      and unambiguous terms. The same specifically provides for prior



 28 (2012) 3 SCC 321.
79.   Bearing in mind the fact that the CCI is empowered to approve,

      reject and/or modify a proposed combination, a Resolution Plan

      approved by the CCI should only be placed before CoC.            The

      ‘commercial wisdom’ accorded to the CoC being paramount, the

      legislature in our understanding, intentionally provided for a prior

      approval of the CCI with respect to Resolution Plans, containing

      combination proposals.
80.   Additionally, the CCI has also been empowered under
Section 31(3)
of the Competition Act as well as
Regulation 25(1)(A)
of the

      Combination Regulations to direct modifications to the Resolution

      Plan or a combination proposal. Therefore, the approval from CCI

      must be obtained before the same is approved by the CoC.

      Otherwise, an illogical situation may arise since any modifications

      so directed by the CCI, would be kept out of the scrutiny of the CoC

      and the CoC would be forced to exercise its commercial wisdom

      without complete information.
86.   When a Resolution Plan containing a provision for a combination

      that leads to an Appreciable Adverse Effect on Competition

      (AAEC) is placed before the CoC for approval before securing prior

      approval from the CCI, the Plan is incapable of being enforced or

      implemented. Specific consequences in law are provided under

      the IBC and the Competition Act for the same. As is clear, such a

      major omission cannot be cured at a later stage. Therefore,



 31 (2015) 4 SCC 544.
(Dis?)Harmony between Stipulated Timelines
88.   However, it must be noted that the model timelines prescribed

      under any regulations, i.e., in the current case, Regulation 40A of

      CIRP Regulations, cannot by any stretch, supersede a statutory

      provision i.e., the proviso to
Section 31(4)
of the IBC. In fact, the

      subordinate legislation must be interpreted in a manner that

      conforms to the statute, and not the other way around, as was

      unacceptably rationalised by the NCLAT.
89.   As far as the two timelines stipulated under the IBC and the

      Competition Act are concerned, the same do not usually cause any



                                   43 of 75
      disharmony or conflict. The only exception could be in the extremely

      rare circumstances discussed below, influenced by external factors.

      But such extreme and unlikely situations cannot and should not be

      allowed to influence our interpretative exercise on the functioning

      of the legislative framework which will fit in with most cases.
92.   In the context of arguments that have been made on the

      disharmony between the two timelines, reference must also be

      made to
Section 6(2)
of the Competition Act. The same is reproduced

      as follows:
15[(2A)No combination shall come into effect until two
             hundred and ten days have passed from the day on
             which the notice has been given to the Commission under
             sub-section(2) or the Commission has passed orders
             under
section 31
, which- ever is earlier.]”
Regulation 5(8)
of the CCI (Procedure in regard to the Transaction

       of Business relating to Combinations) Regulations, 2011 defines

       ‘other document’ as including any document conveying an

       agreement or decision to acquire control over a target company.

       Therefore, the submission of an application before the CCI can be

       done at different stages and need not necessarily wait until the

       Resolution Plan is submitted.
47 of 75
              delay or a large part thereof being attributable to the tardy
              process of the Adjudicating Authority and/or the
              Appellate Tribunal itself, it may be open in such cases for
              the Adjudicating Authority and/or Appellate Tribunal to
              extend time beyond 330 days... ...”
96.   The attempt must therefore be to conclude the entire process of

      insolvency, ‘ordinarily’ within 330 days but in rare circumstances,

      the same can be elongated, particularly when the delay cannot be

      ascribed to the applicants or parties involved but the tardy process

      of the Tribunal or the Adjudicating Authority.


105. The reliance on the decision in
Makalu Trading Ltd. v. Rajiv

     Chakraborty36
, is equally misplaced, as the judgment merely

     reiterates the findings in Arcelor Mittal, without any independent

     analysis or discussion on the merits of the relevant legal

     propositions. Pertinently, Makalu does not address the applicability

     of the proviso to
Section 31(4)
of the IBC, or engage with the legal or

     factual nuances, that may distinguish the cases.


Relevance of CCI & its scrutiny
111. Even if the proviso to
Section 31(4)
of the IBC is kept aside, by

     virtue of the provisions incorporated under Sections 30(2)(e), 30(3)

     and
31(1)
of the IBC, the Resolution Professional has the legal

     obligation to examine each Resolution Plan and determine whether

     it contravenes any provisions of law for the time being in force. In

     this context, the relevant extracts from the IBC are reproduced

     below:
section (2).
…
           (6) The resolution professional shall submit the resolution


                                 53 of 75
          plan as approved by the committee of creditors to the
          Adjudicating Authority.”
S. 31
of the Code states:
(2)     Subject to the provisions contained in sub-section
          (1), any person or enterprise, who or which proposes to
          enter into a combination, shall give notice to the
          Commission, in the form as may be specified, and the fee
          which may be determined, by regulations, disclosing the
          details of the proposed combination, within thirty days
          of—
          …



                                54 of 75
(b) execution of any agreement or other document for
acquisition referred to in clause (a) and clause (d) of
Section 5
or acquiring of control referred to in clause (b) of
that section.
(2-A) No combination shall come into effect until two
hundred and ten days have passed from the day on which
the notice has been given to the Commission under sub-
section (2) or the Commission has passed orders under
Section 31
, whichever is earlier.
(3)    The Commission shall, after receipt of notice
under sub-section (2), deal with such notice in accordance
with the provisions contained in
Sections 29
, 30 and
31

…”
31. Orders of Commission on certain combinations. —(1)
Where the Commission is of the opinion that any
combination does not, or is not likely to, have an
appreciable adverse effect on competition, it shall, by
order, approve that combination including the
combination in respect of which a notice has been given
under sub-section (2) of
Section 6
:
57 of 75
     the scope of the Resolution Professional’s powers.
117. In the current case, a prima facie opinion under
Section 29(1)
of

     the Competition Act was found to the effect that AGI’s Resolution

     Plan, as approved by the CoC, was in contravention of
Section 6
of

     the Competition Act. Only after the proposed divestment proposed

     by AGI Greenpac, did the CCI approve the proposed combination.

     Importantly, much before the proposed divestment and the

     approval to such combination was given by the CCI, the Resolution

     Plan was placed, voted upon and approved by the CoC. Therefore,

     it is apparent that AGI Greenpac’s Resolution Plan as approved by

     the CoC was without the requisite approval of the CCI on that date.

     Therefore this would be in contravention of
Section 6(1)
of the

     Competition Act for the combination in question.
121. The interplay between the IBC and the Competition Act presents a

     delicate balance. While the IBC focused on expeditious revival of

     distressed assets, the
Competition Act
ensures that the resolution

     process does not distort market dynamics. The critical regulatory

     risk that emerges at this intersection is the issue of gun-jumping
122.
The Competition Act
operates on a suspensory regime, under

     which no transaction involving a combination can be completed,

     without prior approval from the CCI. Such mandate ensures that

     competitive equilibrium in the market is not disrupted during the


                                 59 of 75
     CIRP. In fact,
Section 43A
of the Act prescribes severe penalties for

     any attempt to consummate the transaction, prior to securing the

     CCI’s approval.
124.
Section 29(1)
of the Competition Act and
Regulation 2(f)
of the

     Competition Regulations, 2011 mandate the issuance of a Show

     Cause Notice [hereinafter referred to as ‘SCN’] to the ‘parties to the

     combination’ if and when the CCI forms a prima facie opinion that

     a combination is likely to cause or has caused Appreciable Adverse

     Effect on Competition (AAEC), within the relevant market. The

     term ‘parties to the combination’ as explicitly defined under
Regulation     2(f)
includes   both   entities   entering   into   the

     combination and the combined entity, if the combination has come

     into effect.
125. In the present case, it is evident that the CCI, while exercising its

     powers under
Section 29(1)
, failed to issue the mandatory SCN to

     all relevant parties, most notably, the target company itself i.e., the

     HNGIL. The SCN dated 10.02.2023 was issued only to the acquirer

     company i.e., in the present case, AGI Greenpac, although the

     involvement of both parties is integral, to the assessment of

     potential AAEC, in the relevant market. This omission constitutes


                                  60 of 75
     a major procedural lapse, as the law clearly requires all parties to

     the combination to be notified of such finding by the CCI. The

     opportunity to respond must also be given to them.
127. The statutory requirement under
Section 29
and
Regulation 2(f)
could not be bypassed and for this omission. the CCI's order (dated

     15.03.2023) was procedurally deficient, undermining the fairness

     and completeness of the investigative process. The importance of

     adhering to the procedural safeguards enshrined in the Act is to

     ensure that all parties to a combination, are given due notice and

     an opportunity to present their respective case.
Sections 29
and
30
of the Competition Act, 2002 when read holistically, delineate

     a structured procedural roadmap that the CCI must traverse when

     it scrutinises combinations that may exert an Appreciable Adverse

     Effect on Competition (AAEC) in the relevant market.
129. Further clarity on this procedural rigour is provided by Section

      30, which explicitly directs that the prima facie opinion formed

      under
Section 29(1)
must guide subsequent steps under Section

62 of 75
     distinction between these terms, underscoring that ‘investigation’

     is a far-reaching exercise of evidence-gathering and fact-finding,

     especially when compared to an ‘inquiry’. Such an investigation,

     as per the mandate of
Section 29(1A)
, is to be executed under the

     aegis of the Director-General, thereby reaffirming the seriousness

     of the scrutiny, envisaged in cases of combinations.
132. The reasoning advanced by the CCI to avoid the issuance of SCN

     to HNGIL under
Section 29(1)
is unacceptable. Only because the

     Resolution Professional did not object to the same does not

     override the statutory requirements prescribed under the scheme

     of the Act, especially because the target company’s participation is

     central to assessing the competitive impact of the combination.
133. While the term ‘parties’ may appear broad and/or encompassing

     all related entities associated with the combination, such an

     interpretation cannot dilute the inherent plurality attached to the

     word ‘parties’, as explicitly stated in the
Competition Act
and its

     Regulations. The use of the plural form signifies a clear legislative

     intent to address not just one entity but multiple parties directly

     involved in the combination process, including but not limited to

     the acquirer, the target, and, where applicable, the combined

     entity, if the combination has come into effect.
134. Plurality of entities ensures that all perspectives, interests, and

     potential   implications   are    considered   in   assessing    the

     combination's impact on competition. The exclusion of the target

     company from the scope of parties especially in cases of insolvency

     where the target retains critical relevance, would undermine the

     procedural safeguards, designed to achieve transparency and

     fairness. The term ‘parties’ must be understood to cover both

     entities participating in and directly affected by the combination,

     ensuring the integrity of competition assessment and compliance

     with statutory provisions under
Sections 29(1)
and
29(2)
. To argue

     otherwise would not only mutilate the term ‘parties’ but would also

     result in procedural lapses and incomplete analysis, defeating the

     very purpose of the regulatory oversight.
135. Those identified lapses demonstrate a departure from the


                                 64 of 75
     procedural rigour, mandated under the
Competition Act
. Such

     deviations, if permitted, would end up compromising on the

     transparency and fairness requirement in a regulatory process.

     The failure to adhere to the procedural requirements of
Sections

     29(2)
to
29(6)
read with
Section 30
of the Competition Act,

     undermines the robustness of the investigative process, rendering

     the CCI order (dated 15.03.2023), susceptible to a bona fide

     challenge.
65 of 75
     requisites, to the submission of any voluntary modification and

     steps to the contrary, cannot be countenanced.
139. The issuance of SCN to both the acquirer and the target under
Section 29(1)
of the Competition Act in our opinion, is a non-
66 of 75
     negotiable procedural imperative. The interplay between the

     provisions of the
Competition Act
and the IBC necessitates a

     careful balancing of competing interests, underscoring the

     indispensability   of     procedural      compliance.    The     lack    of

     participation by the Target in the voluntary modification process,

     especially where the modification entails the divestment of their

     assets, vitiates the approval granted by the CCI and warrants

     remedial intervention by this Court.
146. The absence of mandatory oversight mechanisms, such as third-
71 of 75
     provisions. Providing relief for stressed assets must necessarily

     align with the statutory framework, as adherence to legal

     principles is fundamental to a fair and just resolution process.
151. Where the provisions allow for dilution or departure from the

     intended scheme of the IBC or the
Competition Act
, it is the

     responsibility of the legislature to rectify such inconsistencies

     through appropriate legislative measures and the judiciary should

     not normally venture into the legislative domain.
153. By upholding the mandatory nature of the statutory provision and

     emphasising    upon    the    critical    importance   of   procedural

     safeguards, the principle of rule of law is upheld in alignment with

     global best practices which underscore fairness, predictability and

     transparency. Such an approach not only reinforces the integrity

     and credibility of the legal framework but also highlights India’s

     commitment to fostering a regulatory environment, which is

     conducive to both business and innovation. Additionally, it also

     ensures the protection and enforcement of rights in an equitable

     manner, free from bias or favouritism.
154. Therefore, a balance between the need for expeditious relief and

     adherence to the statutory framework must necessarily be

     maintained, in order to ensure that the objectives of both, the IBC

     and the Competition Act are met in a manner that supports India's

     long-term economic aspirations.
I have had the opportunity to read the well-crafted judgement circulated by my

Learned Brother, Justice Hrishikesh Roy. In spite of my effort to subscribe to

the view taken by my Learned Brother, for the subtle distinction I noticed in

interpreting the proviso to
section 31(4)
of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy

Code, 2016 (“IBC”), I find it apt to express my position on the same through

this opinion.
5.    The RP on 24.05.2022 issued the Request for Submission of Resolution

Plans (“RFRP”). Clauses 2.6.3(c), 3.3 and 4.1.1(k) require compliance with the

mandate of
sections 5
and
6
of the Competition Act by the resolution applicants

to whom the combination would be attracted.
15.   AGI and RP argued that the word ‘shall’ be read as ‘may’. The proviso is

directory and not mandatory. The statutory implication of
section 6
of the

Competition Act is attracted upon the approval of one or the other resolution

plan by the Adjudicating Authority. Thus, on the effective date for the

implementation of the CIRP, if the Resolution Plan has the approval of a

combination under the
Competition Act
, then the resolution plan is fully

compliant.
23.7.   The NCLAT committed illegality by accepting the requirement under

        proviso to sub-section (4) of
section 31
as directory.
12
23.8.    The interpretation adopted by the impugned order is illegal and

         against the well-established canon of literal interpretation of a clear

         and unambiguous provision.
23.12.   The rule of purposive interpretation would be completely inapplicable

         for interpreting proviso to sub-section (4) of
section 31
. The reliance

         on the memorandum explaining the modifications to the Bankruptcy

         Code Amendment Ordinance, 2018, is misconceived.

23.13.   The proviso is used as an exception to sub-section (4) of
section 31
of

         IBC. Being an exception, particularly in the absence of ambiguity, the

         golden rule of interpretation is the only tool for construing the

         meaning of the said proviso and not purposive interpretation for

         ascertaining whether the approval of CCI is mandatory while CoC

         considers the resolution plan.
24.   The Respondents’ arguments are summarised as follows:
The Parliament, guided by the BLRC report, enacted the IBC. The

      statutory scheme of IBC provides for comprehensive remedies, i.e.,

      recovery of debt through maximization of asset value through CIRP, and

      in a chronic case where redemption of debt through CIRP does not make

      business sense for the stakeholders, then liquidation is triggered. The

      fulcrum of IBC is the preservation of the company in distress as a going

      concern and ensuring the discharge of debt(s) of a stressed company.

24.2. Therefore, the interpretation of the proviso to sub-section (4) of
section

      31
is adopted by looking at the statement of objects and reasons of the

      IBC and the statutory scheme laid out from section 4 through section

      32A of the IBC.
24.4. The non-compliance with
section 5
read with
section 6
of the Competition

      Act, if insisted at the stage of CoC voting on the eligible proposals of

      resolution applicants, then the otherwise “feasible” or “viable” test of

      consideration of the commercial wisdom of CoC is expanded on the

      proposal being compliant with the laws in force. The CoC would be

      deprived of a proposal from a resolution applicant which may be more

      feasible, viable and otherwise eligible if threshold compliance of

      combination approval is insisted while CoC is considering the resolution

      plans.
24.6. A careful study of sub-sections (1) and (2) of
section 31
, read with the

      amended provision and proviso to sub-section (4), would demonstrate

      that the actual stage for statutory compliance under the
Competition Act
is material and relevant only when a decision approving a resolution plan

      is pending before the Adjudicating Authority.
24.7. The checklist for consideration by the Adjudicating Authority is that the

      resolution plan, approved by the CoC under sub-section (4) of section 30,

      satisfies the following requirements –

      o   Sub-section (2) of section 30:
24.14.   The statutory compliance status and the effect of giving approval

         under
section 31(1)
and (2) of the IBC is in the exclusive domain of

         the Adjudicating Authority under
section 31(1)
and (2) of the IBC. The

         language of sub-section (2) of
section 31
is unambiguous. The

         examination of requirements of sub-section (2) of section 30 is at the

         stage of examination under
section 31(1)
of the IBC by the

         Adjudicating Authority. The Adjudicating Authority either approves

         the resolution plan approved by the CoC or rejects the plan ground(s)

         set out in
section 31
of the IBC. The consequences for non-

         compliance of a requirement, including combination approval, are

         applied at this stage. The proviso to
section 31(4)
must be read in the

         same sense and tense that corresponds to
section 31(1)
and (2) of the

         IBC.
25.   The BLRC report notes and acknowledges that the failure of a few

business plans is integral to the process of the market economy. When

business failure occurs, the best outcome for society is to have a rapid re-

negotiation between the financiers to finance a going concern using new

arrangements of capital and restructured management. The re-negotiating
21
process is known as the “Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process”. The

primary object of this effort, briefly stated, is the value maximization of the

corporate debtor. The CIRP keeps the corporate debtor as a going concern and

runs on the theory that the value of the business is worth more than the

realisation of the piecemeal distribution of assets. However, if this objective

cannot be achieved, the best outcome for society is the rapid liquidation of a

failing corporate debtor. When such statutory arrangements are put into place,

the market process of creative construction, on the one hand, and creative

destruction, on the other hand, will work smoothly with greater competitive

vigour.
26.   BLRC lays emphasis on a strong and mature market economy. This

involves well-drafted modern laws that replace the laws of the preceding 100

years and high-performance institutions which enforce these new laws. The

Committee has the end word to provide one critical building block of this

process with a modern Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code and the statutory

design associates institutional infrastructure, which reduces delays and

transaction costs. The BLRC, through the IBC, compartmentalized the

functions and duties of RP, CoC and the Adjudicating Authority.
28.   After taking note of the emerging Indian economy, the best practices of

resolution and liquidation in other economies and the model code of UNCITRAL,

the report has recommended the following guiding principles to the Parliament

for a new Code. Broadly, the objects sought to be achieved by the IBC are (i)

provision of certainty in the market to promote efficiency and growth, (ii)

maximization of value of assets, (iii) striking a balance between liquidation and

reorganisation, (iv) ensuring equitable treatment of similarly situated creditors,
(v) provision of timely, efficient and impartial resolution of insolvency, (vi)

preservation of the insolvency estate to allow equitable distribution to creditors,
(vii) ensuring a transparent and predictable insolvency law that contains

incentives for gathering and dispensing information, (viii) recognition of existing

creditor rights and establishment of clear rules for ranking priority of claims,

and (ix) establishment of a framework for cross-border insolvency.
35.    The objective of the IBC at the first instance is to ensure that the business

activity of the corporate debtor as a going concern is preserved even after the

appointment of a resolution professional. By an order under
section 31(2)
of

the IBC, the corporate debtor is made over to the successful resolution

applicant as approved by the Adjudicating Authority. The IBC envisages the

preservation of the rights of financial creditors, operational creditors, and

employees, as well as the supply of goods or services by the corporate debtor

into the market.
38.   It is axiomatic that while applying the rule of literal construction, the

words of a statute are first understood in their natural, ordinary or popular

sense, and phrases and sentences are constructed according to their

grammatical meaning unless such construction leads to absurdity or unless

there is something in the context or in the object of the statute to suggest the

contrary rule of interpretation.
29
enactment, or to some inconvenience or absurdity, hardship or injustice,

presumably not intended, a construction may be put upon it which modifies

the meaning of the words, and even the structure of the sentence"". The literal

and purposive rules of interpretation, as well as their scope, obligation, and

limitations, are prefaced for further discussion. The right consideration of

issues on hand is achieved by not referring to the precedents on literal or

purposive interpretation. It is axiomatic that the precedents on interpretation are

specific to the statute, language and case. The Court, in a given case before it,

goes by the first principles of the respective tools of interpretation.

44.1. The literal interpretation is not an inviolable rule. The decisions referred

      to supra, while underlying the principle involved in literal interpretation,

      had laid down that the literal interpretation, if it leads to hardship,

      inconsistency,    defeats   the   working    of   the   statute,    and   acts

      counterproductive to the purpose and object sought to be achieved by

      the statute. A statute must be construed in such a manner as to make it

      workable.
46.   The swing is whether the literal or purposive rule of interpretation is

applicable for deciding whether approval of CCI at the stage of section 30(4) of
30
IBC is mandatory or directory. To arrive at which one of the interpretations is

applicable, the summary of the idea, roadmap, implementation, and conclusion

of the IBC, as well as the extent needed, is considered. Literal interpretation

satisfies the application of exact meaning to the words used in the proviso, but

whether such application is consistent with other provisions in
section 31
is to

be determined. If literal interpretation leads to inconsistency with the text and

tense used in
section 31
, then the Court attempts to resolve it to make the

section consistent in text and tense.
47.    According to sub-section (26) of
section 5
, a resolution plan is a plan

proposed by the resolution applicant for the insolvency resolution of the

corporate debtor as a going concern in accordance with Part II.
section 25(2)(h)
sets out the duties of an RP and reads thus:
48.    Section 3010 enables a resolution applicant to submit a resolution plan.


10 30 (1) A resolution applicant may submit a resolution plan    [along with an affidavit stating
that he is eligible under Section 29-A] to the resolution professional prepared on the basis of
the information memorandum.
(a) provides for the payment of insolvency resolution process costs in a manner specified by
the Board in priority to the [payment] of other debts of the corporate debtor;
 [(b) provides for the payment of debts of operational creditors in such manner as may be
specified by the Board which shall not be less than—
(ii) the amount that would have been paid to such creditors, if the amount to be distributed
under the resolution plan had been distributed in accordance with the order of priority in sub-
section (1) of
Section 53
,
whichever is higher, and provides for the payment of debts of financial creditors, who do not
vote in favour of the resolution plan, in such manner as may be specified by the Board, which
shall not be less than the amount to be paid to such creditors in accordance with sub-section
(1) of
Section 53
in the event of a liquidation of the corporate debtor.
Explanation 1.—For the removal of doubts, it is hereby clarified that a distribution in
accordance with the provisions of this clause shall be fair and equitable to such creditors.
Explanation 2.—For the purposes of this clause, it is hereby declared that on and from the date
of commencement of the
Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (Amendment) Act, 2019
, the
provisions of this clause shall also apply to the corporate insolvency resolution process of a
corporate debtor—
(ii) where an appeal has been preferred under
Section 61
or
Section 62
or such an appeal is
not time barred under any provision of law for the time being in force; or
(d) the implementation and supervision of the resolution plan;
(e) does not contravene any of the provisions of the law for the time being in force;
(f) conforms to such other requirements as may be specified by the Board.
 [Explanation.—For the purposes of clause (e), if any approval of shareholders is required under
the
Companies Act, 2013
(18 of 2013) or any other law for the time being in force for the
implementation of actions under the resolution plan, such approval shall be deemed to have
been given and it shall not be a contravention of that Act or law.]
(3) The resolution professional shall present to the committee of creditors for its approval such
resolution plans which confirm the conditions referred to in sub-section (2).
 [(4) The committee of creditors may approve a resolution plan by a vote of not less than [sixty-
six] per cent of voting share of the financial creditors, after considering its feasibility and
viability [the manner of distribution proposed, which may take into account the order of
priority amongst creditors as
laid down in
sub-section (1) of
Section 53
,including the priority
and value of the security interest of a secured creditor], and such other requirements as may
be specified by the Board:
11 31. Approval of resolution plan.—(1) If the Adjudicating Authority is satisfied that the

resolution plan as approved by the committee of creditors under sub-section (4) of Section 30
meets the requirements as referred to in sub-section (2) of Section 30, it shall by order approve
33
51.    The Parliament, realising the need for a few amendments to IBC for the

efficacious working of the Code, enacted Act Nos. 26 of 2018 and 26 of 2019.

The ILRC report notes in paragraph 16.2 that the committee deliberated on a

mechanism for obtaining approvals from the concerned regulators post the

approval of the resolution plan but prior to the Adjudicating Authority’s

approval. Amendment Act 26 of 2018 explains, through clause 24 of the notes

on clauses, that where there is a provision for combination, CCI approval shall

be obtained prior to the approval of the resolution plan by the CoC. On the

contrary, the memorandum to the 2018 Ordinance that led to Act 26 of 2018

notes that CCI approval shall be sought prior to the stage at which the

resolution plan is considered by the adjudicating authority.




the resolution plan which shall be binding on the corporate debtor and its employees, members,
creditors, [including the Central Government, any State Government or any local authority to
whom a debt in respect of the payment of dues arising under any law for the time being in
force, such as authorities to whom statutory dues are owed,] guarantors and other stakeholders
involved in the resolution plan:
52.   It is appropriate to refer to the amendments incorporated by Act 26 of

2018 by which sub-section (4) and the proviso were incorporated. The IBC was

enacted with the intention of improving the ease of doing business in India. In

line with this thinking, one of the legislative measures is the amendment to the

proviso to sub-section (4) of
section 31
of the IBC.
It can examine the challenge only in relation to the grounds specified in
section 61(3)
of the IBC, which is limited to matters “other than” enquiry

      into the autonomy or commercial wisdom of the dissenting financial

      creditors.     Thus,   the    prescribed   authorities    (the     Adjudicating

      Authority/NCLAT)       have   been   endowed    with     clearly   demarcated

      jurisdiction as specified in the IBC and are not to act as a court of equity

      or exercise plenary powers.
58.   The above narrative is relied on to argue that the proviso to sub-section

(4) of
section 31
is violated by the RP and CoC. The above literal construction

ignores the circumstances that surround Act 26 of 2018 and Act 26 of 2019,

which introduced a few amendments to both sections 30 and
31
of the IBC.

58.1. The amendment of a provision of law is appreciated by a comparison

      between the pre-amendment and post-amendment law. The amendment

      to an existing law is necessitated to supplement the gaps noted in

      achieving the purpose or object of the existing enactment. The

      Parliament, after realizing the existence of a few bottlenecks in the

      smooth working of the Act in achieving the object, makes amendments

      in the nature of additions, deletions, exceptions, provisos, etc.

58.2. IBC has undergone a few major changes to improve the working of the

      Code. The Parliament, in its wisdom, has not only incorporated the

      amendments but also the place at which the amendments are to be

      positioned.
59.   In the said background, the Parliament has not incorporated the proviso

to sub-section (4) of
section 31
in the text of section 30 of the IBC. Section 30(2)

of the IBC, read with Regulation 39(4) of CIRP Regulations, 2016, has provided

for what is to be reported to the CoC by RP through Form H.
60.   It is axiomatic to not interpret a section by referring to or relying on the

Regulations made by the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (“IBBI”).

The plain requirement for the RP is to state whether the resolution plan

contravenes any of the provisions of the law for the time being in force.
61.   The Parliament, guided by the real-time working of an enactment based

on a report received or otherwise, had undertaken to amend IBC. The amended

and unamended provisions are excerpted as follows:
section (2) of section   approve the resolution
                   30, it shall by order    plan which shall be
                   approve the              binding on the
                   resolution plan          corporate debtor and
                   which shall be           its employees,
                   binding on the           members,
                   corporate debtor         creditors, [including
                   and its employees,       the Central
                   members, creditors,      Government, any
                   guarantors and           State Government or
                   other stakeholders       any local authority to
                   involved in the          whom a debt in
                   resolution plan.         respect of the
                                            payment of dues
                                            arising under any law
                                            for the time being in
                                            force, such as
                                            authorities to whom
                                            statutory dues are
                                            owed,] guarantors and
                                            other stakeholders
                                            involved in the
                                            resolution plan:
62.   Section 30(1) provides for the submission of a resolution plan by the

resolution applicants. Section 30(2) obligates the RP to examine each resolution

plan received by the RP to confirm that the resolution plan does not contravene
47
any of the provisions of law for the time being in force. The relevant portion of

Form H is reproduced hereunder:
63.2.1. The manner of distribution may take into account the order of priority

          amongst creditors as
laid down in
sub-section (1) of
section 53
.

63.2.2. The manner of distribution includes the priority and value of the

          security interest of the secured creditors.
50
65.1.
Section 31(1)
provides for approval of a resolution plan by the

      Adjudicating Authority and is summarised thus:
be given their ordinary meaning. It is yet another

                  rule of construction that when the words of the

                  statute are clear, plain and unambiguous, then the

                  courts are bound to give effect to that meaning,

                  irrespective of the consequences. It is said that the

                  words themselves best declare the intention of the

                  lawgiver. The courts have adhered to the principle

                  that efforts should be made to give meaning to each

                  and every word used by the legislature and it is not

                  a sound principle of construction to brush aside

                  words in a statute as being inapposite surpluses, if

                  they can have a proper application in circumstances

                  conceivable    within    the    contemplation    of   the

                  statute.”

                                                      (emphasis supplied)


66.2. Further, this Court, in
Harbhajan Singh v. Press Council of India,13
dealt

       with the interpretation of sub-section (7) of
section 614
of the Press

       Council Act, 1978, and employed grammatical tenses to present tenses

       used in the statute:
words “retiring”, used in the present tense, and

“renomination” speak aloud of the intention of the

legislature. If the word “retiring” was capable of

being read as “retired” (sometime in the past) then

there would have been no occasion to use

“renomination” in the construction of the sentence.

If the intention of law-framers would have been not

to permit a person to be a member of the Council for

more than two terms in his lifetime then a different,

better and stronger framing of the provision was

expected. It could have been said: “no member shall

be eligible for nomination for more than two terms”,

or it could have been said:“a retired member shall

not be eligible for nomination for more than two

terms”.
16. We are clearly of the opinion that sub-section

(7) of
Section 6
of the Press Council Act must be

assigned its ordinary, grammatical and natural

meaning as the language is plain and simple. There

is no evidence available, either intrinsic or external,

to read the word “retiring” as “retired”. Nor can the

word “renomination” be read as nomination for an

independent term detached from the previous term

of membership or otherwise than in succession.
67.   The rules of grammar are to be applied unless those rules contradict the

legislative intent or purpose. This statement is more so if it refers to legislative

intent or purpose manifested in the only manner in which a legislature can

authoritatively do so in the text of the enactment. Though not to find out

violability in the text of the enactment, but to keep the content consistent

throughout the enactment – the court gathers the meaning of all the

expressions used in the same section. In this manner, the courts have applied

grammatical construction to provisions of law.
68.   In sub-section (2) of
section 31
, the words “does not confirm to the

requirements of sub-section (1) of
section 31
” grammatically interpreted throw

light on the stage of satisfactory compliance of all the requirements of sub-

section (2) of section 30. The Parliament, in its wisdom, would have employed

the expression “did not” in place of “does not” if the requirement is that the

resolution plan is fully compliant at a stage before consideration of the

resolution plans by the CoC. As part of the interpretative process, the Court

ought not to lose sight of expressions which are in the present tense, such as

“meets”, “does not”, and “satisfies” in
section 31
of the IBC. The word “confirm”

literally means “to verify” for both positive recordings of requirements of sub-

section (1) of
section 31
and also negative recordings of omissions or illegality

in the resolution plans voted by the CoC. There is no ambiguity that when sub-

section (1) of
section 31
is referred to in both the eventualities stated above, it

includes clause (e) of section 30(2) of the IBC. The above literal construction,

as has been canvassed by the appellants, must be applied to the entire scheme
55
of sections 30 and
31
and not merely in isolation to the proviso to sub-section

(4) of
section 31
of the IBC. Sub-sections (1) and (2) of
section 31
obligate the

Adjudicating Authority in its jurisdiction to decide these aspects and consider

whether approval should be granted or rejected.
69.     The consequences of approval are also set out in sub-section (1) of
section

31
, including transferring the business of the corporate debtor to a successful

resolution applicant. Sub-section (4) grants a window of one year to the

successful resolution applicant for obtaining permissions, licenses or permits

under      applicable    laws.   These     are   ex    post    facto   operational

permissions/consents/licences needed to run the business as a going concern

by the successful resolution applicant and to avoid civil or penal consequences.

Sub-section (4) provides for a legal fiction to continue to operate with the

existing permissions/licences/consents in favour of the corporate debtor from

a host of authorities by the successful resolution applicant.
70.     Whereas the meaning, definition and implication of combination

attracting
sections 5
and
6
of the Competition Act are distinct. By keeping in

perspective the language of
sections 5
and
6
of the Competition Act, the

combination should have the approval of CCI on the day on which the

resolution applicant receives approval under
section 31(1)
of IBC. In the

alternative, the absence of combination approval would result in the

combination being void. The successful resolution applicant cannot be allowed

to take over the management awaiting orders of CCI, and the successful

resolution applicant cannot undertake business operations. The memorandum
56
and notes on clauses appended to the ordinance and amendment recognised

the need for statutory protection and the need for due compliance with

statutory requirements of approval of combination under the
Competition Act
by the successful resolution applicant. There is an inconsistency and ambiguity

in the stage of having CCI approval. In such cases, the text of the amended and

unamended sections should guide the interpretation.
71.   Section 30(4) does not obligate the CoC to examine whether the

resolution plan contravenes the requirements of section 30(2)(e) of the IBC. The

comprehensive proposals submitted by the RP and the resolution of the CoC

will disclose feasibility and viability. The proposal of the successful resolution

applicant being legally compliant in a CIRP attracting CCI’s approval for

combination is examined by the Adjudicating Authority.
72.
Essar Steel
(supra) has laid down as a clear principle or ratio that the

CoC is primarily concerned with feasibility, viability and the manner of

distribution proposed, etc., amongst the creditors and may keep in mind
section 53(1)
of the Code. The insistence upon approval of CCI before CIRP

reaches section 30(4) would limit the number of eligible resolution applicants,

and the core objects of CIRP, intended to benefit the stakeholders through

maximization of recovery, is defeated. Noted from the sense of commercial

prudence, unless the resolution plan is acceptable to the CoC, a question arises

as to the prudence for a business entity to move the CCI for approval. Through

the Amendment Act, the proviso to subsection (4) has been inserted within
section 31
. If the timing of having approval of the combination is at the stage
57
where the CoC is considering the resolution plans, then the insertion would

have been in section 30, but not as is reflected in the amended
section 31
of

the IBC. Stepping up the requirement to a stage not envisaged by the

parliament, particularly not resulting in a consequence for not having the

approval of CCI, would be akin to writing too much into the sentence. In this

context, if the requirement of approval of combination at the stage of CoC is

held as mandatory, then through a literal interpretation of the proviso to
section 31(4)
, the Court would be catapulting the proviso to a place not

expressed by the parliament. Precisely reiterated, such interpretation, apart

from causing difficulties in CIRP defeats the very object of maximization of

recovery.
73.   In contradistinction,
section 31(4)
specifically refers to due compliance

with the requirements of sub-section (1) of
section 31
, which then refers to the

requirements in sub-section (2) of section 30 with regard to approval of the

resolution plan. The statutory compliance by the resolution applicant is divided

into two stages viz., firstly, sub-section (4) provides a window time of one year

to obtain necessary approval under any law by the resolution applicant; and

secondly, having the combination approval before sub-section (2) of
section 31
of IBC. This said compliance status enables the Adjudicating Authority to

accept or reject a resolution plan which does not confirm to the requirements

referred to in sub-section (1) of
section 31
. The final consideration of the

resolution plans before the Adjudicating Authority arises in the manner
laid

down by
this Court in
Essar Steel
(supra). The absence or presence of
58
combination approval while a decision is taken under sub-section (4) of section

30 is not very relevant from the perspective of feasibility or viability. The

Adjudicating Authority, if it is satisfied that the resolution plan has provisions

for effective implementation, then one facet of verification is over. After which,

it is verified whether to reject the resolution plan for not confirming to the

requirements referred to in sub-section (1) of
section 31
. To wit, it is noted as

an example that a resolution applicant gets into the management of the

corporate debtor by an order under
section 31(1)
of the IBC, and has

combination approval for the resolution plan on that day, then the consequence

of
section 6
of the Competition Act, namely the combination being void, is not

attracted. The purpose and object of the IBC and the subsequent amendments

are to provide theoretical and practical resolution to the financial difficulties of

a stressed corporate debtor for the benefit of the stakeholders of the corporate

debtor. The statutory scheme is not intended to give undue advantage or

hardship to the resolution applicants.
74.   Yet another reason taken note is that as per the statutory scheme, the

resolution plan receives two kinds of approvals, one by the CoC under sub-

section (4) of section 30 primarily on feasibility and viability and another from

the Adjudicating Authority that the resolution plan has provisions for its

effective implementation and that the resolution plan confirms to sub-section

(2) of section 30, including clause (e). The proviso to sub-section (4) of
section

31
needs to be carefully examined. It may be noted that the proviso to sub-
59
section (4) of
section 31
refers only to a resolution plan containing a provision

for combination.
78.   When adopting a consequentialist approach, it becomes clear that the

insistence upon a combination approval at the stage of Section 30(4) does not

place the stakeholders at an advantageous position. Further, presenting the

combination approval at the stage of consideration by the Adjudicating

Authority under
section 31(1)
and (2) does not diminish the value of the

stressed assets because of robust competition among eligible resolution

applicants. Further, the opportunity cost that arises from treating the stage at

which combination approval is required as mandatory may disturb the smooth

working of the intricate and competitive insolvency resolution system that the

IBC envisages. Thus, the consequences of compliance and non-compliance with

all the legal requirements of the resolution plan arise only before the

Adjudicating Authority. Consequently, to keep
section 31
uniform in all

perspectives, it is concluded that in the place of literal interpretation, purposive

interpretation is apt; therefore, the word ‘shall’ in the proviso to
section 31(4)
of the IBC is interpreted and held as directory.
79.   From the above discussion, it is held that the proviso to sub-section (4)

of
section 31
is directory and would be compliant with IBC and the Competition

Act. Hence, the combination approval of CCI at the stage of consideration of the

resolution plan by the Adjudicating Authority under
section 31(1)
would be

proper and legal. Such interpretation keeps the operations of the successful

resolution applicant as a going concern, without deviating from the rigour of
62
the
Competition Act
, and simultaneously, a one-year window is granted to

obtain licenses, permissions, consents and other regulatory approvals

envisaged by a host of laws. Therefore, the proviso is interpreted purposively

and held that the approval of a combination of CCI at the stage of consideration

by CoC is directory and not mandatory. By operation of
section 31(2)
of the

IBC, to avoid rejection of a fully compliant and voted resolution plan, the

Adjudicating Authority confirms that the approval of the combination is

available before implementing the resolution plan. At best, the use of the words

“prior to” is a temporal expression whose mandatory or directory nature is to

be determined from the context surrounding
section 31
.
80.   IBC and the Competition Act have timelines for the discharge of a duty

and function. In this light, it is impermissible to interpret the provisions in one

enactment by keeping in perspective the starting point of a timeline and the

termination of a timeline in the other enactment. The enactments are allowed

to work parallelly and without pressure for performance from the other in line

with the duties and obligations cast through the enactments.
83.    The view taken by the NCLAT on the question of whether the requirement

of proviso to sub-section (4) of
section 31
of IBC is mandatory or directory is

correct. Thus, the appeals fail.
1.       The civil appeals assail the order Dt. 28.07.2023 of the National

Company Law Appellate Tribunal, Principal Bench, New Delhi (“NCLAT”). The

appeals arise under the
Competition Act, 2002
(“
Competition Act
”).
compliance with
section 29(2)
renders the combination approval Dt.

15.03.2023 illegal and unsustainable. The prima facie opinion formed by the

CCI under
section 29(1)
of the Competition Act steps up consideration to the

stage of investigation. The combination approval under
section 31
could be

granted only after complying with
section 29(2)
of the Competition Act.
Regulation 25(1) (a)
of Combination Regulations 2011 has been misinterpreted

or misapplied. The NCLAT in the above set of contentions framed the following

points for consideration:
2.   Whether
Section 29
, sub-section (1)
Section 29(1)
of the
     contemplates that a Show Cause          Competition Act contemplates
     Notice to be issued to the parties to   that show cause notice has to
     combination, i.e., both acquirer and    be issued to the parties in
     the target entity or word 'parties'     combination. Thus, the notice
     occurring in
Section 29(1)
has to be    has to be issued to the target
     read singularly?                        and the acquirer. In the
                                             present case, show cause
                                             notice was merely issued to
                                             the acquirer – AGI.
3.   Whether non-issuance of Show            The mere non-issuance of
     Cause Notice to HNGIL vitiates the      notice does not vitiate the CCI
     order of approval granted by the        proceedings. The reasoning
     Commission under
Section 31
, sub-       adopted by the NCLAT was
     section (1)?                            that the RP has no objection
                                             and placed the Resolution
                                             Plan before the Adjudicating
                                             Authority.
4.   Whether after formation of prima-       The CCI noted that there was
     facie opinion that combination is       no occasion to form an

     (1), there was no occasion to form
     again a prima facie opinion under
Section 29(2)
after receipt of
     response to the Show Cause Notice
     and the CCI was required to
     complete the further process under
Section 29(2)
including direction to
     the parties to the combination to
     publish details of combination?
5.   Whether the process as                  The process as contemplated

6.   Whether in spite of Respondent          The CCI, after issuing show

8.   Whether the Commission in the           There is application of mind,

Section 20(4)
of the
Section 20
, sub-section (4) of the
Competition Act
have been
     Act or the impugned order suffers       followed.
19.         The arguments are summed up as follows:
Therefore, the conditional approval of combination under
section 31
of

      the Competition Act is vitiated.
(3)The Commission may invite any person or member of the public, affected or likely to be affected
by the said combination, to file his written objections, if any, before the Commission [within ten
days] from the date on which the details of the combination were published under sub-section
(2).
23.3. Show cause notice is issued expecting a reply on why an investigation

      in respect of such a combination should not be conducted.

23.4. A show cause notice in legal parlance means the opportunity given to the

      addressee to say what his case is, on the prima facie opinion formed for

      further steps under
section 29
are warranted or not. As part of the

      inquisitorial exercise, the CCI verifies and applies the threshold of

      precautionary principle to understand whether AAEC in the proposed

      combination would arise or not. If
section 29
is worded such that in all

      the cases where prima facie opinion is formed, the corollary of forming

      such opinion leads to calling for the DG’s report, directing parties to

      publish details, then the expression as contained in
section 29
would

      have been different.
Section 29(1)
of the Competition Act, as worded by

      the parliament, provides for formation of prima facie opinion, issuance of

      show cause notice and receiving a reply from the party. The intermediary

      step of show cause notice and reply provides an opportunity to

      satisfactorily explain the doubts entertained by CCI while forming the

      prima facie opinion on AAEC. In other words, the argument that the

      issuance of show cause notice is preceded by prima facie opinion and

      other steps of
section 29
are followed such course would go contrary to

      the plain language of
section 29(1)
of the Competition Act.
18
27.   The show cause notice under
section 29(1)
is intended to get a response

or clarification from the acquirer on the combination which is likely to cause or

has caused AAEC within the relevant market in India. The prima facie opinion

is required in law to set in motion the show cause notice. The CCI has

jurisdiction upon being satisfied with the response as per the scheme of the

section to not proceed further. The argument of the appellants would result in

the show cause notice being treated as a decision to investigate the Form II

application filed for approval of a combination. Under sub-section (2) of
section

29
, the Commission is of the prima facie opinion that the combination has or

is likely to have AAEC. The distinction on the prima facie opinion being formed

under
sections 29(1)
and
29(2)
is emphasised thus:
28.   It may be noted that to form a prima facie opinion under sub-section (2)

of
section 29
of the Competition Act, the CCI in sequence has:
In these matters, the three of us could not reach a common

conclusion. Brother Justice Sudhanshu Dhulia has concurred with
Page 1 of 2
the opinion that has been penned by me, while Brother Justice S.V.N.

Bhatti has decided to write a separate opinion canvassing an alternate

view, reaching a different conclusion. However, such differences must

be understood as useful steps towards the evolution of jurisprudence

in the field of Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 and the
Competition Act, 2002
. In that context, I am reminded of the quote

from Shakespeare’s “The Taming of the Shrew” the theme of which we

do not necessarily endorse.       But there the playwright perhaps

accidentally, touched the world of our adversarial litigation. He wrote -

“And do as adversaries do in law, strive mightily. But eat and drink

as friends”.42.   Where the language is clear, plain and unambiguous, the courts are

      duty-bound to give effect to the meaning that can be inferred from a

      statute, irrespective of the consequences. Mere inconvenience being

      caused to a party, by virtue of the plain and literal interpretation

      accorded to a statute, cannot be reason enough to forego such

      interpretation.
67.   While literal interpretation must remain the judiciary’s guiding light,

      insights gained from legislative debates, committee reports and/or

      historical contexts may be looked at with a degree of caution, lest

      they obscure the plain meaning of the text or elevate subjective

      predilections of the judge above the clear mandate of the law. Such

      an inquiry into legislative history, therefore needs to be carefully

      undertaken as a supplement to but not as substitute of the literal

      interpretation of the statutory language, mindful of the risks of

      wandering too far afield into the uncertain waters of committee

      reports, memorandums and legislative debates.
68.   Let us now pay attention to the Report of the Insolvency Law

      Committee (dated 01.03.2018), which recommended that specific

      timelines be incorporated in the IBC, to seek approval from



                                    33 of 75
      government authorities as well as the CCI. The relevant extracts from

      the Report are as follows:
36 of 75
      However, the last line in the Memorandum states that the same is

      to clarify that the approval from CCI for the combination, shall be

      obtained prior to the approval of the Resolution Plan, by the

      Adjudicating Authority, instead of CoC, as mentioned in the

      preceding line and also the inserted proviso. A question might

      therefore arise – whether it was an inadvertent legislative error? As

      can be appreciated, the erstwhile Ordinance provided for a ‘post-

      Adjudicating Authority’ approval stage. The Memorandum clarified

      that a new step had been added at a ‘pre-Adjudicating Authority’

      approval stage. It would therefore be logical to hold that obtaining

      prior approval of the CCI before the CoC approval, would seamlessly

      cover the ‘pre-Adjudicating Authority’ approval stage without any

      possible disruption.
74.   The error as noticed above, appears to have been inadvertently

      made while drafting the Memorandum but this is not the case in

      the drafting of the statute. The particular line in the Memorandum

      could also be a Scrivener’s Error, a judicial doctrine developed in

      the USA, as put forth by Mr. Parag Tripathi, learned senior counsel

      for AGI Greenpac. This doctrine was explained by legal scholars in

      the following terms26:
77.   More importantly, such external aids of interpretation could have a

      limited role only when repugnancy within the statute fall for

      consideration. But that is not the situation here as the language of

      the statute is clear, specific and unambiguous.
42 of 75
      approval by CoC to such a deficient Resolution Plan can have no

      legal implications. In the present case, the CCI-unapproved

      Resolution Plan does not pass the muster. The same cannot be

      approved by this Court as it is in violation of Sections 30(2)(e),

      30(3), 30(4) and
34(4)(a)
of the IBC. It therefore does ‘contravene

      provisions of the law for the time being in force’.
93.   The point at which the applicant is allowed to give notice to CCI of

      a combination, i.e., the trigger event, need not therefore be limited

      to when the Resolution Plan is submitted to the Resolution

      Professional. On the contrary, such notice can be given immediately

      after or within thirty (30) days of the execution of ‘any agreement’


                                     45 of 75
       or ‘other document’, disclosing details of the proposed combination.
94.   The argument that the application to obtain approval from the CCI

      can only be submitted at the stage when the Resolution Plan is

      submitted i.e., T + 135 days, in the timeline would be erroneous and

      unacceptable. The application under the statutory scheme, can be

      submitted at various stages, including but not limited to, at the time

      of Expression of Interest i.e.., T + 60 days, or issuance of RFRP i.e.,

      T + 105 days, or even when the list of provisional Resolution

      Applicants is published i.e., T + 85 days. Taking this into account,

      submitting the combination proposal before the CCI at either of these

      stages, would have still resulted in the culmination of the entire

      process, within the stipulated time limit of 330 days, under the IBC.
97.   However, if notice for the proposed combination under
Section 6(2)
of

      the Competition Act has been given within the stipulated time and

      no dilatory tactics have been employed, the parties should not be

      held responsible for any delay on the part of the CCI, in examining

      the combination. The CCI, as their counsel Mr. Balbir Singh points

      out, has been able to approve bulk of the proposed combinations, in

      a time-bound and reasonable manner, as can be gleaned from the

      Annual General Reports and material placed on record, by Mr. Singh.
98.   In the present case, even though dilatory tactics are said to have

      been adopted in the submission of notice under the Combination

      Regulations, with Form II submitted on 03.11.2022, the combination

      was approved on 15.03.2023 i.e., within 132 days. The recent

      Competition (Amendment) Act, 2023 which reduced the timeline for

      approving combination proposal from 210 days to 150 days and

      requiring the CCI to give a prima facie opinion on the likelihood of a


                                     48 of 75
      combination causing an Appreciable Adverse Effect on Competition

      (AAEC) from 30 days to 15 days, is indicative of the more realistic

      and shorter timelines that the CCI ordinarily requires for its analysis

      and decision-making, pertaining to such combination proposals.
99.   Flowing from the above, it is difficult to interpret the provisions

      disjunctively, as has been done by the NCLAT, in the impugned order

      dated 18.09.2023.
51 of 75
       declaration of law or binding precedent, but simply implies that the

       case was not considered worthy of examination for a reason, other

       than on merits.37
123. Bearing in mind the above discussion, it appears that several

     procedural deficiencies have occurred in the approval process of

     the combination.
29. The procedural design mandates an expansive fact-finding

      mission, including consultation with stakeholders and detailed

      scrutiny, to ensure that the combination either withstands the

      muster of competitive fairness or is modified to avert any

      deleterious market impact.
136. In light of the voluntary modification proposed by the acquirer i.e.,

     AGI Greenpac, pursuant to
Regulation 25(1A)
of the Competition

     Commission of India (Procedure in Regard to the Transaction of

     Business Relating to Combinations) Regulations, 2011 [hereinafter

     referred   to   ‘Combination   Regulations’],   the   aforementioned
Regulation 25(1A)
unequivocally mandates that a voluntary

     modification submitted to the CCI, must bear the imprimatur of

     both parties to the combination, namely, the acquirer and the

     target. This statutory requirement is not just a procedural

     formality. It is in fact a substantive safeguard, designed to ensure

     that interests of all stakeholders are duly represented and

     protected. In the present matter, the proposed modification seeks

     the divestment of the Target's plant, a move that inherently

     attracts the provisions of the IBC. The active participation and

     explicit approval of the target company are indispensable pre-
137. Furthermore, the legislative intent underpinning
Regulation

     25(1A)
necessitates a holistic and inclusive approach to such

     modifications, particularly where the proposed measures, impinge

     upon the operational and structural integrity of the target

     company. The facts of this case underscore the criticality of this

     requirement, as the proposed divestment scheme is a vital

     component of the revival of the stressed target company under the

     resolution framework contemplated by the IBC.
138. As earlier noticed, the failure to issue a SCN under
Section 29(1)
to the Target Company/Corporate Debtor, constitutes a major

     procedural lapse with significant consequence. The statutory

     scheme of the
Competition Act
, as well as the synergistic

     framework of the IBC, demands that all parties to the combination

     are afforded a fair opportunity to participate in the decision-

     making process, particularly when the proposed measures bear a

     direct and material impact on their interests. The absence of such

     notice undermines the procedural sanctity of the modification

     process and renders the resultant approval susceptible to bona

     fide challenge.
143. Transparent and accurate data disclosures are fundamental to the

     regulatory mechanism. The identified discrepancies compromise

     the very basis of the CCI’s decision-making process. It is

     imperative   to   therefore    underscore   that   discrepancies   in

     operational capacity data would strike at the very root of the

     regulatory mechanism. While we do not intend to embark on a

     fact-finding expedition afresh, the prima facie inconsistencies in

     the submitted data ought to have been examined with greater care

     by the NCLAT. But this was not done. Consequently, the

     conditional approval should have been revoked, especially in light

     of the CCI’s express mention in its order (dated 15.03.2023) that

     the order may be revoked if the information provided by the


                                   68 of 75
     acquirer is found to be incorrect at any particular time.
144. Conditional approvals, by their very nature, necessitate rigorous

    and ongoing enforcement to ensure compliance with the prescribed

    conditions in both letter and spirit. For the AGI Greenpac-HNGIL

    combination,    the   absence   of      a   robust    and   comprehensive

    monitoring mechanism reveals a significant lacuna within the

    regulatory framework. Such deficiencies pose considerable risk of

    non-compliance or deliberate circumvention, thereby defeating the

    entire purpose of imposing these conditions. The systemic

    inefficiencies apparent in this instance highlight the existing

    fragility of conditional approvals when not accompanied with robust

    enforcement mechanisms.
148. As India aspires to establish itself as a global manufacturing

       powerhouse and investment hub, it is imperative that it is able to

       provide a reliable, robust and competitive business environment

       for both domestic and international stakeholders. In essence, the

       introduction of the Green Channel route, which strives to create a

       level-playing field and enable new entrants to effectively compete

       with established players in the Indian market, is a significant step

       in that direction. However, to ensure that entities operate with

       utmost confidence in the sanctity and fairness of India’s legal and

       regulatory system, the objectives of the IBC and the Competition

       Act must also necessarily be in harmony with one another.
150. In the present case, for reasons discussed above, the statutory

     provision   and   legislative   intent   unequivocally   affirm    the

     mandatory nature of the proviso to
Section 31(4)
of the IBC. For a

     Resolution Plan containing a combination, the CCI’s approval to

     the Resolution Plan, in our opinion, must be obtained before and

     consequently, the CoC’s examination and approval should be only

     after the CCI’s decision. This interpretation respects the original

     legislative intent, and deviation from the same would not only

     undermine the statute but would also erode the faith posed by the

     stakeholders in the integrity of our legal and regulatory framework.
152. Further, the indispensability of procedural safeguards as an

     integral component of a just legal order must be given its due

     weight, especially as procedural requirements are not mere

     formalities to be circumvented for expediency but substantive

     protections designed to ensure fairness and transparency. In that


                                 72 of 75
     light, the procedural lapses with respect to objections to the

     proposed    combination       and       the   consequent    divestiture

     modification proposed within the framework of the
Competition

     Act, 2002
, seriously vitiated the integrity of the process. It is

     therefore reiterated and reinforced that adherence to procedural

     propriety is non-negotiable and that the ends cannot justify the

     means.
155. The upshot of the above discussion are the following orders:
6.    On 26.09.2022, AGI Greenpac Limited (“AGI”) submitted the draft

resolution plan to the RP. The Appellant, Independent Sugar Corporation

Limited (“INSCO”) in Civil Appeal No. 6071 of 2023, is one of the resolution

applicants. INSCO received green channel combination approval on 30.09.2022

from the Competition Commission of India (“CCI”). In the e-voting of the

Committee of Creditors (“CoC”), Dt. 27.10.2022, the resolution plans of AGI
5
received 98% votes, and INSCO received 88% votes. The communication Dt.

28.10.2022 of the RP addressed to INSCO noted that AGI was declared as the

successful resolution applicant.
7.    On 27.09.2022, AGI applied to CCI in Form I for approval of the proposed

CIRP combination of taking over HNGIL. The said approval was rejected by CCI

on 22.10.2022. AGI, on 03.11.2022, applied to CCI in Form II for approval of

the proposed combination of taking over HNGIL through CIRP.



A.    PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE ADJUDICATING AUTHORITY
8.    On 05.11.2022, the RP moved the Adjudicating Authority for approval of

the decision of the CoC Dt. 27.10.2022, viz., declaring AGI as the successful

resolution applicant. On 14.11.2022, INSCO filed I.A. No.1497 of 2022 before

the Adjudicating Authority for setting aside the resolution plan approved by the

CoC in the e-voting Dt. 27.10.2022. The prayers in the applications filed by

INSCO read as follows:
9.    The gist of the objections of INSCO before NCLT is that the

communication of CCI Dt. 15.03.2023 approving the combination of AGI with

HNGIL cannot be taken on record. The communication Dt. 15.03.2023 is

subject to compliance with the modification offered by AGI. The approval of CCI

must be prior to the approval by the CoC. In other words, the approval of CCI

for the proposed combination is mandatory and available when the CoC

considers the resolution plan submitted by a resolution applicant. The ex post

facto approval was granted when the consideration under
section 31
of IBC was

pending before the Adjudicating Authority. The proviso to
section 31(4)
of IBC

is mandatory and not directory.
11.   On 15.03.2023, CCI approved the combination application of AGI with

HNGIL    with   a   few   conditions.   During   the   pendency   of    IA   (IB),

No.1497/KB/2022 filed by INSCO for rejecting the application filed for approval

of the minutes of the meeting Dt. 27.10.2022, AGI and the RP filed I.A.Nos.628

and 701/KB/2023 to place on record the combination approval order Dt.

15.03.2023 of CCI. The objection of INSCO proceeds that the proviso to
section
7
31(4)
mandates the resolution applicant to have prior approval of CCI on the

combination proposed through the resolution plan.
17.    The above excerpt defines the scope of controversy in the subject appeals.

The learned counsel appearing for the parties, in great detail, made

submissions on several aspects which are intrinsically pending consideration

before the Adjudicating Authority. The approach of NCLAT to the issues on

hand is adopted and the legality of NCLAT and the Adjudicating Authority’s

orders is examined.
23.10.   The condition to hive off the Rishikesh plant is not commensurate

         with the resolution plan of taking over HNGIL as a going concern.

23.11.   The statutory timelines under section 12 of the IBC and Regulation

         40A of the CIRP Regulations, 2016 are not deviated by insisting upon

         prior CCI approval.
24.3. The exclusive literal interpretation of the proviso to sub-section (4) of
section 31
and holding that it is mandatory would preclude or prevent

      the     participation   of   eligible    resolution   applicants.   This   would

      consequently provide a quick start to a resolution applicant having green
14
channel combination approval from CCI. Further, the object of

      maximising the value of stressed assets with the participation of a

      resolution applicant with green channel approval against a resolution

      applicant requiring a combination approval would diminish the

      competitive spirit of the CIRP and the value maximization of stressed

      assets. The submission of draft resolution plan by all the eligible

      applicants, dehors combination approval, would reflect on the potential

      asset realization. Competition in resolution plans, voting by CoC, and

      appreciation of feasibility and viability are all commercial facets

      interwoven with one another.
24.5. The CoC, by the statutory scheme, regulations and precedents, is

      conferred the discretion to decide only on the commercial viability or

      feasibility of the resolution plans submitted by the competing and eligible
15
resolution applicants and have the approval of the Adjudicating

      Authority.
24.17.   The respective statutory authorities can operate parallelly and

         harmoniously without stressing or straining the respective timelines.



         After hearing the learned counsel for the parties and perusing the

record, the question of law taken up for consideration is – whether the proviso

to sub-section (4) of
section 31
is mandatory or directory at the stage of

consideration of the resolution plan by the CoC?



IV.   POLICY UNDERLYING THE IBC
27.   The report recommended assessing the viability of a corporate debtor and

noted that the economic purview presented an advantage by calling for the

assessment of the viability of an enterprise or a project. An enterprise that has

fastened financial failure is considered as a viable enterprise and there is

possible financial re-arrangement that can earn the creditors a higher economic
22
value in contrast to shutting down such an enterprise. On the contrary, if the

cost of financial re-arrangement required to keep the enterprise going is higher

than the non-performance value of future expected cash flows, then the

enterprise is considered unviable or bankrupt and is better shut down as soon

as possible.
36.   The brief narrative of the working of the Code takes us to the point posed

for consideration in these appeals. The appellants commend the literal rule of

interpretation to the proviso and have laid much emphasis on the expressions

viz., “shall”, “prior to”, and “committee of creditors”. This argument applies the

golden rule of interpretation in establishing that the proviso is mandatory and

must be complied with before the stage of sub-section (4) of section 30, i.e.,

consideration of the resolution plan by CoC at the time of voting. The extended

argument is that a combination approved post the decision taken under section

30(4) of the IBC cannot be relied upon and taking on file the approval of

combination Dt. 15.03.2023 of CCI, as proposed by AGI, is an illegal exercise

of jurisdiction.
37.   The argument of literal construction, at first blush, appears to be simple

and available to the object sought to be achieved. The RP also acted contrary

to the law by bringing on record the approval of a combination of CCI proposed

by AGI.
45.   Literal interpretation is not the only tool to begin with while constructing

a statute. The often-cited judgements on literal interpretation set out when

purposive interpretation is considered and preferred over literal interpretation.

In the instant appeal, both interpretations have been commended for

consideration.
(i) the amount to be paid to such creditors in the event of a liquidation of the corporate debtor
under
Section 53
; or
(c) provides for the management of the affairs of the corporate debtor after approval of the
resolution plan;
54.   Reference to these external aids for interpreting the proviso under

consideration would arise only after completing the exercise of literal or

purposive interpretation.
The legislature, consciously, has not provided any ground to challenge

      the “commercial wisdom” of the individual financial creditors or their
39
collective decision before the adjudicating authority and is made non-
56.4. While the ultimate business decision lies with the CoC, such a decision

      should indicate adequate consideration of the objectives of the IBC.

      Accordingly, the adjudicating authority should ensure that the decision

      of the CoC takes into account the following factors: (i) the corporate

      debtor should continue as a going concern during the resolution process,
(ii) the value of assets of the corporate debtor should be maximised, and
56.6. The jurisdiction bestowed upon NCLAT is also expressly circumscribed.
57.   The admitted circumstances are that –
40
57.1. On 27.09.2022, AGI in Form I applied for approval of the combination of

      the subject resolution plan.
57.2. On 22.10.2022, the application in Form I was rejected by CCI.

57.3. On 27.10.2022, through e-voting, the CoC approved AGI’s resolution

      plan for HNGIL.
63.1.     The CoC approves a resolution plan by a vote of not less than sixty-six

          per cent of the voting share of the financial creditors.

63.2.     The CoC ascertains the feasibility and viability of a resolution plan and

          also the manner of distribution of priorities.
64.     It is noteworthy that sub-section (4) of section 30 of the IBC

conspicuously does not refer to the checklist prescribed in sub-section (2) of

section 30 of the IBC. By law and precedent, the CoC, while exercising its

commercial wisdom, is required to assess the feasibility, viability and

prioritisation of interests. In its commercial wisdom, nothing prevents the CoC

from appreciating the fallout of non-compliance with combination approval by

one of the resolution applicants. This circumstance may influence the voting

pattern of the CoC. However, it cannot result in the rejection of a non-compliant

resolution plan.
65.     The duties and functions of the Adjudicating Authority under
section 31
of IBC are as follows.
75.    The question as to whether a requirement under the statute is mandatory

or directory depends upon the intent of the legislature and not upon the

language in which the intent is clothed. The meaning and intention of the

legislature must govern, and these are to be ascertained not only from the

phraseology of the provision but also by considering its nature, its design, and

the consequences which would follow from construing it one way or the other.15
3.       AGI Greenpac Limited (“AGI”) and Indian Sugar Corporation Limited

(“INSCO”) were prospective resolution applicants in the corporate insolvency

resolution process (“CIRP”) ordered by the NCLT in Case No. CP (IB) 369/2020.

The resolution professional (“RP”) issued the request for resolution plan

(“RFRP”) Dt. 24.05.2022. The RFRP stipulates in Clauses 2.6.3(c), 3.3 and

4.1.1(k) that the approval of the combination by the Competition Commission

of India (“CCI”) is available before the Committee of Creditors (“CoC”) considers

the resolution plan. Considering the financials and market share of HNGIL, the

rigour of combination as defined in
section 5
of the Competition Act is attracted
2
to the proposal of AGI since it has a substantial presence in the relevant market

in India.
Sections 5
and
6
of the Competition Act set out the combination and

regulation of combinations. To wit, it is noted that the resolution applicants to

the RFRP Dt. 24.05.2022 who are in the manufacture and supply of glass

containers similar to the activities of HNGIL are informed to have the approval

of the combination of the proposed resolution plan before the CoC considers

the feasibility and viability of the resolution plan.
4.    If the proposal of the resolution applicant contributes to horizontal or

vertical relationships, then the requirements of
sections 5
and
6
of the

Competition Act are attracted, and due compliance is necessitated.
7.    INSCO and AGI fall within the purport of Clauses 2.6.3(c), 3.3 and

4.1.1(k) of the RFRP. On 27.09.2022, AGI filed Form I with CCI under

regulation 5(2) of the Competition Commission of India (Procedure in regard to

transaction   of   business   relating   to   combinations)   Regulations   2011

(“Combination Regulations 2011”) intimating the proposed combination of AGI

and HNGIL as part of CIRP. On 30.09.2022, INSCO, a foreign player, applied

in Form I for combination approval under the green channel for the proposed

combination in the CIRP of HNGIL and received deemed approval vide notice

C-2022/09/974. The UP Glass Manufacturers Syndicate (“UPGMS”), Appellant

in Civil Appeal No.4054/2023, filed objections before the CCI to the Form I

application made by AGI on 27.09.2022. On 13.10.2022, CCI directed AGI to

file a notice in Form II in terms of
Regulation 5(5)
of the Combination

Regulations 2011. On 27.10.2022, the CoC approved AGI’s resolution plan by

98% vote through e-voting.
9.    CCI, upon forming a prima facie opinion that the proposed combination

of AGI with HNGIL is likely to cause appreciable adverse effect on competition

(“AAEC”) in the relevant market in India, decided to issue a show cause notice

to AGI. On 10.02.2023, CCI issued a show cause notice under
section 29(1)
of

the Competition Act to AGI to show cause as to why an investigation in respect

of the proposed transaction should not be carried out. On 10.03.2023, AGI

replied to the show cause notice Dt. 10.02.2023 and voluntarily offered to hive

off or divest the Rishikesh Plant upon approval of the resolution plan by the

Adjudicating Authority under the IBC. This was followed by further

clarifications of AGI on 14.03.2023. CCI, on 15.03.2023, approved, under
section 31(1)
of the Competition Act, the modified combination of AGI.
11.   AGI and HNGIL are engaged in the manufacture and supply of glass

containers. The activities of HNGIL and AGI involve both horizontal and vertical

relationships. The CCI delineated the relevant product market as container

glass packaging and noted the operation and existence of both wholesale and
5
retail segments by AGI and HNGIL. The CCI appreciated the combined market

share of HNGIL and AGI in the delineated relevant market as – (i) Alco-Beverage

(40-50%) and (ii) F&B (80-85%). The combined effect of AGI and HNGIL is noted

as significant players in the Alco Beverage and F&B Sector. The combination is

likely to have significantly increased the level of concentration in the relevant

market for container glass. Further, the countervailing power of the buyers is

limited in the market, and imports seem to be marginal in the relevant market

of the proposed combination. Moreover, the “failing firm” defence that a delay

in acquisition would adversely affect the viability of the target was rejected, and

a holistic approach to the assessment of the proposed transaction was applied,

which involved accepting and balancing structural changes in the combination

details. It is contextual to note the following clauses in the modification plan

Dt. 10.03.2023 and 14.03.2023. The important features of the modification to

the suggested combination are stated thus:
1.  Whether the Appellant(s) have locus   The NCLAT noted that the
          to challenge the order of the         appellants have locus to file
          Competition Commission of India       the appeal. The NCLAT looked
          dated 15.03.2023 within the           at the judgement of Samir
                                                Agarwal v. CCI1 in coming to a

                                             has to be read widely.
7.   Whether the modifications               Decisions by expert body

     expressed in the Show Cause Notice      the Act and the Regulations.
     under
Section 29
, sub-section (1)?
18.         We have heard learned Senior Counsel Shri Rajshekhar Rao, Dr.

Abhishek Manu Singhvi, Shri Dushyant Dave and Shri Balbir Singh for the

appellants.
(4)The Commission may, [within seven days] from the expiry of the period specified in sub-section
(3), call for such additional or other information as it may deem fit from the parties to the said
combination.
24.   Reverting to the circumstances of the case, AGI, in its response to the

show cause notice Dt. 10.02.2023, replied and suggested modification to the

combination vide communication Dt. 10.03.2023 and 14.03.2023. The case of

both AGI and CCI is that CCI’s regulatory jurisdiction for deciding on the

approval of a combination was satisfied with the reply/modification suggested,

resulting in the combination approval Dt. 15.03.2023. The argument of the

appellants is that once a show cause notice is issued under
section 29(1)
, CCI

should have called for a report from the Director General. This argument is

untenable and rejected accordingly. Therefore, passing an order of approval to

the proposed combination without further steps of investigation on the

proposed combination of
section 29
of the Competition Act is legal.
25.   The admitted case of all parties is that the CCI accepted a reply and

modified proposal on 10.03.2023, determining no further investigation was

necessary. The core legal dispute centers on
section 29(1)
of the Competition

Act and its procedure, specifically the phrase “is likely to cause or has caused

appreciable adverse effect on competition within the relevant market in India"".

The CCI initially issued a show cause notice, a preliminary investigative step

requiring parties to justify why an in-depth examination of the proposed

combination should not be conducted. The jurisdictional nuance lies in the

Commission's requirement to form a prima facie opinion before compelling a

response,   which   involves   carefully   assessing   whether   the   proposed

combination might substantially impact competitive dynamics.
19
26.   The procedural violation pointed out is that on the receipt of the response

from AGI, the report of the Director General is not called for and no

investigation is ordered by CCI. As part of statutory regulation, if it were to be

the object and intention of the Parliament to call for a report from the Director

General in every case where the prima facie opinion is formed, then the further

steps, namely, issuing show cause notice and receiving response would not

have been contemplated.
If the plural expression on a case-to-case basis is understood as singular, then

it would restrict the meaning of the language. Hence, the findings recorded by

the NCLAT are affirmed. It is a matter of record that the RP, taking note of the

approval of the combination proposed by AGI, filed an application before the

Adjudicating Authority on 08.04.2024 for taking on file the approval of the

combination and in the pending issues under
section 31
of IBC. Whether the

non-issuance of notice to the RP is a ground available to the appellants to

challenge the approval of the combination is yet another question which is not
23
considered and decided by the NCLAT. In the circumstances of the case, the

findings recorded on this behalf, particularly, at the instance of the appellants

herein.
36.   The appellants argue that CCI's consideration of AGI’s data is inaccurate

or lopsided. CCI consists of experts and specialists in different branches of

trade, commerce and technology. The consideration by the experts, as rightly

noted by NCLAT, must be given due weightage. In an appeal under
section 53T
of the Competition Act, the data details need not be reconsidered, and findings

need not be recorded on whether the proposed combination has AAEC in the

relevant market in India. The counsel appearing for the objectors tried to point

out the TPD taken note of by CCI and the capacity of HNGIL and AGI. AAEC,

as determined by the CCI, considers the product outflow from the acquirer and
25
the target. These factors determined the market share and AAEC in the relevant

market in India. Established, installed or consented capacities are permissions

held by a business entity. From the permission granted for higher capacity,

AAEC is not appreciated until the capacity is used to the maximum by the

enterprise. There is no ground to re-examine the issues in fact. The

consideration and conclusion recorded by CCI, as confirmed by NCLAT, are

affirmed; consequently, the appeals are dismissed.126. The CCI was obligated to issue an appropriate SCN to both the

     acquirer and the target.       The term ‘to the parties to the

     combination’ cannot be restricted to the proposed acquirer alone.

     The finding of the NCLAT on this aspect is therefore not to be

     faulted.
145. Furthermore,    conditional    approvals       are    fundamentally   ill-

    equipped to mitigate the risks that manifest during the interim

    period, preceding the full implementation of remedial measures.

    The underlying assumption that post-approval remedies will rectify

    present market distortions, fails to account for the practical

    challenges and complexities associated with enforcing such

    remedies, retroactively. This approach creates an enforcement lag

    that can result in significant and potentially irreparable harm to the

    competitive landscape and the interests of the stakeholders. The

    temporal gap between the grant of approval and the implementation


                                 69 of 75
    of effective remedies fosters a regulatory vacuum, thereby

    exacerbating the likelihood of anti-competitive conduct, during this

    transitional phase. The failure to mitigate present risks undermine

    the efficacy of conditional approvals and their intended regulatory

    objectives.
12.   The adjudicating authority vide order Dt. 28.04.2023 dismissed IA (IB)

No.1497/KB/2022 filed by INSCO. By the order of even date, I.A. Nos. 628 and

communication Dt. 15.03.2023.
prior to approval by the CoC is mandatory. The

                  other aspects of the approval of the resolution plan

                  is since pending adjudication of the Adjudicatory

                  Authority, we need not express any opinion on other

                  submissions raised by the parties”.
23.9.    CCI’s conditional combination approval of AGI on 15.03.2023 implies

         that unless the condition is complied with, there is no combination

         approval by CCI in favour of AGI.
(2) The resolution professional shall examine each resolution plan received by him to confirm
that each resolution plan—
31
(iii) interests of all stakeholders are balanced.

56.5. In the event that the adjudicating authority, on a review of the facts of

      the case, concludes that the aforesaid factors have not been considered,

      it may send the resolution plan back to the CoC but not alter the

      resolution plan of its own accord.
63.2.3. Such other requirements as may be specified by IBBI.

with the feasibility and viability.

I.       BACKGROUND
10.   The combination was approved vide order Dt. 15.03.2023 and was

challenged before the NCLAT by a few aggrieved parties. NCLAT, through the

order Dt. 28.07.2023, impugned in the civil appeals, dismissed the appeals and

confirmed the combination approved by CCI. Hence, the civil appeals.



II.   THE GIST OF CCI ORDER DT. 15.03.2023
from non-application of mind?

17.         CCI filed four appeals against the findings recorded by the NCLAT on the

legal obligation to issue notice to both parties to the combination and not just

the acquirer under
section 29(1)
of the Competition Act. Hence, the batch of

civil appeals against the order Dt. 28.07.2023.
(5)The additional or other information called for by the Commission shall be furnished by the
parties referred to in sub-section (4) [within ten days] from the expiry of the period specified in
sub-section (4). (6) After receipt of all information and within a period of forty-five working days
from the expiry of the period specified in sub-section (5), the Commission shall proceed to deal
with the case in accordance with the provisions contained in
section 31

j hrishikesh roy j sudhanshu dhulia j svn bhatti new delhi january 29 2025 page 2 2,25677,14421,Payment of Gratuity Act,"Fact: AGI Greenpac Ltd. is the second largest company in the field of glass packaging and manufacturing in India, after HNGIL. With two manufacturing plants in Telangana, AGi Greenpac is the leading manufacturer of container glass. The combination of the two major players in this sector is likely to result in an Appreciable Adverse Effect on Competition.
Issue: These are statutory appeals under.Section 62of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 [hereinafter referred to as ‘IBC’] against the judgement dated 18.09.2023 (impugned order) passed by the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal.
Petitioner's Argument: INSCO, the unsuccessful Resolution Applicant, made the following submissions: 18. “In any case, these issues should not be entertained by the Supreme Court at this premature stage, as these are pending for consideration before the NCLT.” “Since there was no change in AGI Greenpac’s. Resolution Plan, it was argued that Plan is not conditional.’ “It is therefore argued that courts can pierce through the alleged obvious error and discern the true purpose behind the enactment”
Respondent's Argument: On 22.10.2022, CCI declared the application filed by AGI Greenpac as ‘not valid’ Thereafter, final Resolution Plans were submitted for consideration by the CoC. On 10.03.2023, AGi Greenpac submitted a divestment plan to CCI in respect of one of the seven HNGIL plants (situated in Rishikesh, Uttarakhand), as part of a voluntary modification.
Precedent Analysis: HNGIL has manufacturing plants located in Bahadurgarh (Haryana), Rishra (West Bengal), Neemrana (Rajasthan), Naidupeta (Andhra Pradesh), Sinnar (Maharashtra), Puducherry and Rishikesh (Uttarakhand) HNGIL catering to a wide range of industries, including pharmaceutical and wellness, cosmetics, food & beverage, and alco-beverages.
Analysis of the law: According to Mr. Chidambaram, RP’s role is procedural, with no substantive involvement in Resolution Plans. It was argued that the RP adhered to the law and followed NCLAT.
Court's Reasoning: The courts are duty-bound to give effect to the meaning that can be inferred from a statute, irrespective of the consequences. While literal interpretation must remain the judiciary’s guiding light, insights gained from legislative debates, committee reports and/or historical contexts may be looked at with a degree of caution, lest they obscure the plain meaning of the text.
Conclusion: The CCI was obligated to issue an appropriate SCN to both the acquirer and the target. The term ‘to the parties to the combination’ cannot be restricted to the proposed acquirer alone. The finding of the NCLAT on this aspect is therefore not to be faulted.","Fact: The Competition Commission of India (CCI) is examining the proposed combination of Hyderabad-based Hindustan National Glass Limited (HNGIL) with AGI Greenpac Ltd.
Issue: The appellants are Hindustan National Glass and Industries Ltd.
Petitioner's Argument: The Supreme Court of India heard the appeal of AGI Greenpac against the Bombay High Court’s rejection of its resolution plan.
Respondent's Argument: The Competition Commission of India (CCI) granted an approval to AGI Greenpac’s combination proposal with HNGIL (Corporate/Target Company), subject to the compliance of certain modifications including the divestment of one of the seven HNGIL plants (Rishikesh, Uttarakhand).
Precedent Analysis: The Competition Commission of India (CCI) granted approval to the Resolution Plan of AGI Greenpac Ltd.
Analysis of the law: Here are the key points of the case:
Court's Reasoning: In our series of letters from African journalists, film-maker and columnist Farai Sevenzo considers the meaning of literal interpretation.
Conclusion: The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) has held that the Competition Commission of India (CCI) did not have the power to issue aSpecific Competition Notice (SCN) to the parties to the proposed merger.","Fact: AGI Greenpac is the second largest company in the field of glass packaging and manufacturing in India, after HNGIL . potential market share of 80-85% in F&B segment and 45-50% in alco-beverage segment . combination of the two major players in this sector is likely to result in an appreciable adverse effect on competition .
Issue: these are statutory appeals under Section 62 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 [hereinafter referred to as ‘IBC’] against the judgement dated 18.09.2023 (impugned order) passed 2 of 75 by the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal . also, there is a set of appeals arising out of the NCLAT Order dated 28.07.2023, pertaining to the approval accorded to the combination between HNGIL and AGI Greenpac
Petitioner's Argument: since there was no change in AGI Greenpac’s Resolution Plan, it was argued that Plan is not conditional . 22. Mr. Parag Tripathi invoked the Principle of Scrivener’s Error .
Respondent's Argument: AGI Greenpac submitted a divestment plan to CCI in respect of one of the seven HNGIL plants (situated in Uttarakhand), as part of a voluntary modification, to comply with the requirements of Competition laws . on 15.03.2023, CCI granted an approval to AGI's combination proposal with HNGil (Corporate Debtor/Target Company)
Precedent Analysis: key party in this matter is HNGIL i.e., the Corporate Debtor/Target Company with a 60% market share of the glass packaging industry in India . Appellant objected to the approval accorded . to the resolution plan stating that they had not obtained the requisite . CCI approval .
Analysis of the law: it was argued that the RP adhered to the law and followed NCLAT 13 of 75 judgments correctly treating the proviso to Section 31(4) as directory .
Court's Reasoning: courts are duty-bound to give effect to meaning that can be inferred from a statute . literal interpretation must remain judiciary’s guiding light . but insights gained from legislative debates, committee reports and/or historical contexts may be looked at with a degree of caution .
Conclusion: the term ‘to the parties to the combination’ cannot be restricted to the proposed acquirer alone . conditional approvals are fundamentally ill-equipped to mitigate the risks that manifest during the interim period ."
