For the convenience of the exposition, this judgment is divided in the following

parts:

8, CONSTITUENT ASSEMB. DEB., (May 30, 1949) 431.
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 4 of 414
(iii) Pendency of a number of files submitted to the Governor for premature

          release of prisoners.
(iv) Pendency of proposals submitted to the Governor for appointment of

          members to the Tamil Nadu Public Service Commission underArticle

          316of the Constitution.

3.   The Legislature for the State of Tamil Nadu, between 13.01.2020 and

     28.04.2023, enacted and forwarded 12 Bills to the Governor for grant of

     assent as perArticle 200of the Constitution. Even though the present

     Governor took charge of the office with effect from 18.11.2021, yet he did

     not take the necessary action on any of the said Bills forwarded to his office

     till October 2023. The petitioner, being aggrieved by the inaction on part of

     the Governor, had to ultimately file the present writ petition before this

     Court. The same was filed on 31.10.2023.

4.   This Court issued notice to the respondents on 10.11.2023. The Governor,

     forthwith, took a decision on the 12 Bills on 13.11.2023 by withholding

     assent simpliciter to 10 bills i.e., he did not convey any message to the State

     Legislature for reconsideration of the said Bills as prescribed under the firstW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                         Page 5 of 414proviso toArticle 200, and by reserving two Bills for the consideration of

     the President. The 10 bills for which assent was withheld were returned to

     the State Legislature by the Governor.

5.   The State Legislature, on 18.11.2023, convened a special session and

     repassed the 10 bills which were returned by the Governor after withholding

     of assent. The bills were passed without any material change and were

     forwarded to the Governor’s Secretariat on the same day for his assent in

     accordance with the first proviso toArticle 200.This Court, in its order dated

     20.11.2023, noted that since the repassed 10 bills were pending with the

     Governor, the hearing of the writ petition be adjourned to 01.12.2023 and

     issued directions that this Court shall be apprised of the progress in the

     matter.

6.   On 28.11.2023, the Governor, without the aid and advice of the Council of

     Ministers of the State, in exercise of his discretion, reserved the said

     repassed Bills for the consideration of the President. The letter of the

     Governor to the Union Government referring the said Bills for the

     consideration of the President mentioned that the Bills were re-considered

     and passed again by the State Legislature. Interestingly, although the

     Governor noted that the Bills were intra-vires the competence of the State

     Legislature having been legislated under Entry 66 of List I, Entry 32 of ListW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                          Page 6 of 414II and Entry 25 of List III, yet he reserved the said Bills for the consideration

of the President in the second round on the ground that the Bills suffered

from repugnancy on account of being contrary to Entry 66 of the Union List

i.e., List I. These grounds have been taken by the Governor to reserve the 10

Bills for consideration of the President. For reference, we have extracted the

relevant portion of the letter pertaining to the Tamil Nadu Fisheries

University (Amendment) Bill, 2023 which reads thus:
ordination. and determination of standards in institutions of
        higher education or research and scientific and technical
        institutions Is in Entry No.66 of the Union List of the Seventh
        Schedule of the Constitution, the Bills suffer from
        repugnancy. Hence, the Hon'ble Governor has reserved the
        Bill viz. Tamil Nadu Fisheries University (Amendment) BIii,
        2023 (LA Bill No.15 of 2023) for the consideration of the
        Hon'ble President.
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                           Page 7 of 414
4. The Bill falls, mainly, within the scope of the following
             entries of the Union, State and Concurrent. Lists In the
             Seventh Schedule to the Constitution, namely-
UNION LIST
             Entry 66·- Co-ordination and determination of standards in
             institutions for higher education or research and scientific
             and technical institutions.
STATE LIST
             Entry 32 -- Incorporation, regulation and winding up of
             corporations, other than those specified in List-I and
             Universities;
CONCURRENT LIST
             Entry 25 -- Education, including technical education,
             medical education and universities and is intra-vires the
             State Legislature.
5. I am, therefore, directed. to request to take appropriate
             action for the Bill to have consideration of the Hon'ble
             President.”
7.   The Governor, on 04.12.2023, also sought to clarify that the 10 Bills to

     which he had withheld assent simpliciter were not returned to the Legislature

     for reconsideration as stipulated in the first proviso ofArticle 200.Despite

     that, the State Government had placed the Bills before the legislative

     assembly again. After the Bills were repassed by the legislative assembly,

     the State Government sent the same back to the Governor for assent. The

     Governor clarified that since the Bills suffered from repugnancy, he was

     reserving the said Bills for the consideration of the President. These

     clarifications were sent for all the 10 Bills. For reference, we have extractedW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                         Page 8 of 414the relevant portion of the letter pertaining to the Tamil Nadu Fisheries

University (Amendment) Bill, 2023 which reads thus:
4.⁠ ⁠However, State Government placed the Bill again in the
             Legislative Assembly and after getting Assembly's
             endorsement, sent them again to the Hon'ble Governor on
             18.11.2023.
5.⁠ ⁠The Hon'ble Governor had not returned the Bills under the
             proviso toArticle 200for re-consideration, however, State
             Government has sent them back. Since the Bill suffers from
             repugnancy, Hon'ble Governor has reserved the same for the
             consideration of the Hon'ble President.”
8.   In view of the reservation of the 10 Bills for the consideration of the

     President, the petitioner filed the I.A. No. 259020 of 2023 on 11.12.2023,

     seeking amendment of the prayers of the present writ petition and prayed for

     insertion of the following prayer:
9.   Thus, what was sought to be conveyed by the aforesaid I.A. was that the 10

     Bills were reconsidered and passed again by the State Legislature and were

     thereafter forwarded to the Governor for his assent in terms of the first

     proviso toArticle 200.However, the Governor reserved the said Bills for

     the consideration of the President. It was alleged that such action on the part

     of the Governor was violative ofArticle 200and was done with a mala fide

     intention only with a view to circumvent the jurisdiction of this Court.
10. Upon the suggestion made by this Court, the Governor, on 12.12.2023 wrote

     to the Chief Minister for the State of Tamil Nadu inviting him to a meeting

     in an attempt to resolve the deadlock. The Governor and the Chief MinisterW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 11 of 414met on 30.12.2023, pursuant to which the Chief Minister submitted a

    representation summarising the following issues:
11. In light of the above representation, the Chief Minister requested the

    Governor to:
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 12 of 414
12. Out of the 10 Bills reserved for her consideration, the President withheld

              assent to seven Bills, granted assent to one Bill and is yet to consider the

              remaining two Bills.

13. The status of the Bills is summarized below:
University Act, 2012.                                               President on

                                                                              28.11.2023.
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                            Page 13 of 414
2.   Bill No 12/2020 namely 18.10.2020    Assent          18.11.2023   Reserved for Assent         is

     “A Bill further to amend             withheld on                  consideration awaited

     the      Tamil            Nadu       13.11.2023.                  of        the since

     Veterinary and Animal                                             President on 28.11.2023.
into cases of corruption against public servants.
14. Between 10.04.2022 and 15.05.2023, the Government of Tamil Nadu

              submitted to the Governor, four files relating to the prosecution of public

              servants involved in crimes of moral turpitude under thePrevention of

              Corruption Act, 1988, which at the time of filing of the writ petition

              remained pending with the Governor.

15. It is only upon the present writ petition being filed and issuance of notice

              that the Governor’s office started acting upon the files. The Governor, on

              01.12.2023, submitted the factual position regarding the bills, files and other

              cases pending with his office detailing the actions taken thereupon. The

              details of the files requesting for sanction to investigate and prosecute and

              the Governor’s actions thereupon are summarised below:
iv.   Factual background with respect to the appointments to the Tamil
      Nadu Public Service Commission (TNPSC).
19. It is the case of the petitioner that it was represented before the Governor by

      way of various representations that as perRegulation 3of the Tamil Nadu

      Public Service Commission Regulations, 1954, the Commission shall

      consist of a Chairman and 14 Members. However, no heed was paid to such

      representations. The functioning strength of TNPSC was of four members

      on the date of filing of the present petition.

20. In regard to the aforesaid, the petitioner forwarded representations to the

      Governor’s office seeking approval of the proposed names for the positionW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 20 of 414of members in TNPSC and carrying out their appointments. The petitioner

     also sent reminders to the Principal Secretary to the Governor for acting on

     the files sent to the Governor’s office in this respect.
21. The Governor, on 27.09.2023, returned the said files with a note raising

     some queries regarding transparency in the selection process, tenure of the

     members to be appointed and credentials of the proposed candidates. The

     Governor clarified that as the queries raised by his office were not addressed

     by the petitioner, the proposal for appointment of the recommended

     candidates was being returned and the same was no longer pending before

     him. This happened on 26.10.2023.

22. The petitioner, on the other hand, has averred in its writ petition that such

     queries were against the established practices to the selection of

     constitutional posts and that the availability of the chairman and members in

     the TNPSC was essential to monitor and expedite various recruitment

     processes as well as promotions. Delays in appointments to the TNPSC

     resulted in non-availability of sufficient members, which detrimentally

     affected the functioning of the Executive.

23. The petitioner explained this position and also addressed the queries raised

     by the Governor in its clarification note dated 07.10.2023. The files forW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 21 of 414approval of appointments were accordingly re-submitted on 10.10.2023,

     however, the same were returned by the Governor on 27.10.2023 without

     assigning any reasons.
v.   Factual background with respect to dismissal of ministers and
     allocation of ministries.
24. On 29.06.2023, the Governor suo moto and contrary to the aid and advice of

     the State Council of Ministers recommended the dismissal and divestment

     of portfolio of Senthil Balaji, a minister in the Tamil Nadu Cabinet on the

     ground that he was arrested by the Enforcement Directorate and was in

     judicial custody. However, the Governor addressed another letter to the

     Chief Minister on the very same day informing that he had kept the dismissal

     of Senthil Balaji in abeyance till further communication in light of the advice

     of the Union Minister of Home Affairs that it would be prudent to seek the

     opinion of the Attorney General on the matter.

25. In a similar case, Dr. K. Ponmudy, a minister in the Government of Tamil

     Nadu was convicted and sentenced by the Madras High Court against which,

     he filed an appeal before this Court. This Court, vide order dated 11.03.2024,

     suspended the conviction of Dr. K. Ponmudy from its operation keeping in

     viewSection 8(3)of the Representation of People’s Act, 1951 and moreW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 22 of 414particularly for the reason that he should not suffer disqualification from the

    office of Member of Legislative Assembly.

26. Accordingly, on 13.03.2024, the Speaker of the State Legislative Assembly

    declared that the disqualification ceased to operate with effect from

    19.12.2023. The Election Commission also withdrew the notification of

    vacancy for his constituency.

27. The Chief Minister wrote to the Governor on 13.03.2024 to swear in Dr. K.

    Ponmudy as a Minister and allot to him the portfolio of Higher Education.

    However, the Governor vide the letter dated 17.03.2024, declined the request

    stating that the conviction order was suspended from its operation by way

    of ‘interim relief’ granted by this Court which meant that the conviction

    against Dr. Ponmudy, though existent, had been made non-operative and not

    set aside. The Governor also stated that the re-introduction of Dr. K.

    Ponmudy in the Cabinet would be against “constitutional morality”.
28. Consequently, the petitioner was constrained to file I.A. No. 69967 of 2024

    on 18.03.2024 to amend its prayer in the present writ petition for including

    the relief of staying the operation of the Governor’s letter dated 17.03.2024

    and directing him to administer the oath of office and secrecy to Dr. K.

    Ponmudy. The amendment sought to be made reads thus:
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 23 of 414
29. This Court heard the application on 22.03.2024 and expressed its displeasure

     at the reluctance of the Governor to accept the order of this Court dated

     11.03.2024 suspending the sentence of Dr. K. Ponmudy. This prompted the

     Governor to swear in Dr. K. Ponmudy as Minister in the State Cabinet and

     the I.A. was disposed of accordingly recording the same.W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 24 of 414
30. In the aforesaid factual matrix, the petitioner have prayed for a declaration

     that the reservation of the bills by the Governor for the consideration of the

     President after they were repassed by the State Legislature and presented

     before him as illegal. Further, as a sequitur, the petitioner have prayed that

     the act of withholding of assent by the President be declared as void ab-

     initio. The petitioner have also prayed for a declaration that the simpliciter

     withholding of assent by the Governor without following the procedure

     prescribed in the first proviso toArticle 200, be also declared to be illegal

     for being in contravention to the position of law aslaid down inState of

     Punjab (supra). The petitioner have also prayed for a direction to the

     Governor to accord sanction for prosecution, take prompt decision on the

     pending files pertaining to grant of remission and to clear the proposal for

     appointment of members to the TNPSC.

31. Mr. Rakesh Dwivedi, the learned Senior Counsel appearing for the

     petitioner, made elaborate submissions on the following aspects:
The Governor could not have kept the Bills submitted to himW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 25 of 414between the years 2020 and 2023 in a cold storage without taking

         any decision on them. The fact that he entered no discussion with

         the State Government or the Chief Minister in relation to the Bills

         submitted to him further indicates that the Governor exercised

         pocket veto in relation to the said Bills, thereby bringing the

         constitutional machinery to a standstill. He submitted that the

         substantive part ofArticle 200uses the expression “shall declare”

         which indicates that the function of the Governor is mandatory. The

         underlying objective ofArticle 200is to make a Bill operative as

         an Act. Therefore, the scheme ofArticle 200negates the possibility

         of engaging in inordinate delay or pocket veto.

ii)   The Governor failed to take note of the decision of this Court in

         State of Punjab (supra). Although the said decision held that the

         first proviso toArticle 200attaches to the option of withholding

         assent, yet the Governor recorded a simpliciter finding of

         withholding assent without conveying any message to the State

         Legislature, as provided under the first proviso. He submitted that

         simpliciter withholding of assent by the Governor is also violative

         ofArticle 14which mandates that the exercise of Constitutional

         powers should be based on reason and transparency. The State

         Legislature must be told why the assent has been withheld so as toW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 26 of 414enable it to reconsider the Bill. He further submitted that in the

          absence of any message, it would be open to the State Legislature

          to understand that the Governor wishes the entire Bill to be

          reconsidered.

iii)   On the facts of the present case, Mr. Dwivedi submitted that having

          recorded that the Bills submitted to him were intra vires of the State

          Legislature, it was not open to the Governor to reserve the Bills for

          the consideration of the President upon being repassed and

          presented again before him. He submitted that once the reservation

          of the Bills for the consideration of the President is found to be

          erroneous in law, any subsequent withholding of assent by the

          President would also be legally vitiated.

iv)    He submitted that even the withholding of assent by the President

          underArticle 201was by way of a non-speaking order and thus

          does not comply with the first proviso to the Article. Similar toArticle 200, the withholding of assent underArticle 201must

          necessarily result in a message under the first proviso. He

          summarised his arguments on this aspect by submitting that the acts

          of simpliciter withholding, reserving for the consideration of the

          President, delay by Governor, as well as simpliciter withholding ofW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                         Page 27 of 414assent by the President are all unconstitutional, and hence null and

         void.

b) Justiciability and Judicial Review.
i)    Mr. Dwivedi submitted that no constitutional power vested in any

         authority, howsoever high, is beyond the powers of judicial review

         of the constitutional courts. The scope of judicial review may vary,

         but no power is beyond the purview of the courts. The Courts may

         exercise restraint, but that is not to say that if the power has been

         exercised unconstitutionally, manifestly arbitrarily, in breach of

         fundamental rights enshrined in Part III or any other provision of

         the Constitution, or in a mala fide manner, the courts would be

         prohibited from striking down the exercise of such power.
ii)   In furtherance of the aforesaid submission, he drew our attention to

         the decision inS.R. Bommai v. Union of Indiareported in (1994)

         3 SCC 1 wherein the justiciability of a proclamation underArticle

         356was propounded.He also relied upon the decisions of this

         Court inRameshwar Prasad v. Union of Indiareported in (2006)

         2 SCC 1 and Kihoto Holohan v. Zachillhureported in 1992 Supp

         (2) SCC 651 wherein the exercise of power of the Governor to

         invite the leader of the majority party to form government and theW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 28 of 414power of the Speaker under the 10th Schedule to the Constitution

          were respectively held to be justiciable by this Court.
iii)   In light of the aforesaid, he submitted that the position of law as on

          date, as explained by several Constitutional Bench decisions, is

          clear that no exercise of Constitutional power is outside the ambit

          of judicial review. No power is absolute and non-justiciable. Hence,

          the power exercised underArticle 200can also be examined by this

          court to discern any unconstitutionality.

c) Governor is required to act upon the aid and advice of the Council
   of Ministers.
i)     Mr. Dwivedi submitted that the various provisions of the

          Constitution stand in harmony and are interdependent. They are not

          isolated silos. They share the ultimate objective of harmonious

          Parliamentary governance, seek welfare of the people and

          implement Parliamentary form of democracy within a federal

          system. Therefore, interpretation of a Constitutional provision

          should accord with these fundamental principles and the basic

          structure of the Constitution.

ii)    He submitted that this Court has been consistent in its approach

          while interpreting the constitutional provisions, more particularlyW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                           Page 29 of 414those that pertain to the Governor or the President, in light of the

          fundamental       principles   of   Parliamentary   democracy    and

          federalism. He placed reliance on the decisions of this Court inSamsher Singh v. State of Punjabreported in (1974) 2SCC 831,

          S.R. Bommai(supra), Nabam Rebia & Bamang Felix v. Dy.

          Speaker, Arunachal Pradesh Legislative Assembly reported in

          (2016) 8 SCC 1 in support of the aforesaid submission.
iii)   He further submitted that the discretion of the Governor under the

          Indian Constitution is governed solely byArticle 163(1)and the

          interpretation adopted by this Court has been such which does not

          make the Governor dominant over the Chief Minister, who is an

          elected representative of the people.

iv)Article 200embodies an aspect of legislative procedure so as to

          make a Bill operative as an Act. Seen thus, it is imperative that the

          Governor acts upon the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers

          when exercising his power underArticle 200.

v)     Taking us through the historical background in whichArticle 200came to be drafted, Mr. Dwivedi submitted that Section 75 was the

          provision corresponding toArticle 200in theGovernment of India

          Act, 1935. However, in Section 75 the expressions “Governor inW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 30 of 414his discretion” and “Governor may, in his discretion” were

         deployed in the substantive part and the proviso respectively. Later

         on, when the draft of the Constitution was prepared by the

         constitutional advisor, the expression “Governor in his discretion”

         was dropped from the substantive part ofArticle 147 (predecessor

         of draftArticle 175), but the expression “Governor may, in his

         discretion” was retained in the proviso. The same position

         continued inArticle 175of the Draft Constitution, 1948

         (hereinafter, “the Draft Constitution”) (predecessor of Article
200) presented before the Constituent Assembly. However,

         ultimately, the expression conferring discretion was dropped andArticle 200came to be adopted in its present form. He submitted

         that the reason for this was explained by Dr. Ambedkar who said

         that there can be no room for the Governor to act on his discretion

         in a responsible form of government. Further, it was explained by

         Mr. T.T. Krishnamachari that the returning of the Bill to the

         Legislature will only be upon the advice of the Council of Ministers

         and not on the personal discretion of the Governor.

vi)   Mr. Dwivedi submitted that issues of repugnance of State

         legislation with a Central enactment are not of easy determination

         and the only method of discourse between the Governor and theW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 31 of 414State Legislature is provided in the first proviso toArticle 200.
Hence, simpliciter withholding of assent without taking recourse to

         the first proviso ought to be rejected by the Courts and compliance

         with the first proviso ought to be mandated in every case of

         withholding of assent. Furthermore, issues of repugnance should be

         left for the constitutional courts to decide.

vii) The interpretation ofArticle 200must be done in line with the

         intent of the framers of the Constitution which is evident from the

         Constituent Assembly Debates. The only instance where this Court

         adopted an approach contrary to the one suggested by the

         Constituent Assembly pertained to the appointment of Judges to the

         High Court and this Court and that approach was adopted to

         preserve the independence of the judiciary, which is part of the

         basic structure. However, in the present case, there is no compelling

         need to diverge from the view adopted by the Constituent Assembly

         as that view supports the fundamental principles of federalism.
d) Option of withholding of assent is attached to the first proviso toArticle 200.
i)    He submitted that the exercise of power to withhold assent by the

         Governor is coupled with the duty of the Governor to comply with

         the procedure prescribed in the first proviso toArticle 200and theW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 32 of 414same has been recognised in the decision inState of Punjab(supra).

ii)    On the use of the expression “shall declare” in the substantive part

          ofArticle 200, he submitted that this expression in the main part ofArticle 200would, by necessary implication, require the Governor

          to mention the reasons for withholding the assent.

iii)   He submitted that the expression “shall not withhold assent

          therefrom” in the first proviso toArticle 200takes away the option

          of reserving the Bill for the consideration of the President from the

          Governor when the Bill is repassed by the State Legislature and

          presented before him for assent. In support of his submission, he

          argued that the use of a negative expression renders the course of

          action prescribed as mandatory in nature. He further submitted that

          the phraseology of the first proviso toArticle 200is different from

          the proviso toArticle 201inasmuch as the latter does not oblige the

          President to mandatorily assent to the Bill after it has been repassed

          by the State Legislature and is presented before him again.

          Whereas, in contrast, the first proviso toArticle 200is couched in

          a negative language and thus prohibits the Governor from taking

          any other recourse than granting assent.
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                         Page 33 of 414
e) Reservation of bills for the consideration of the President.
i)     Mr. Dwivedi submitted that the power to reserve the Bill for the

          consideration of the President is not open ended. If specific

          provision of the Constitution does not require Presidential assent to

          the Bill passed by State Legislature, then such a Bill cannot be

          reserved for the consideration of the President.

ii)    He submitted that a further limitation on the power to reserve a Bill

          is that it can only be reserved on the aid and advice of the Council

          of Ministers and the Governor has no personal discretion in this

          matter.Articles 31A, 31C, 213, 254, 288, 304(b), 360and 6th

          Schedule are the only provisions which expressly require assent of

          President. It is only when these articles are attracted that the

          Governor can reserve the Bills for consideration of the President.

          In the exclusive domain of Legislation under the State List or List-

          II of the 7th Schedule of the Constitution, no assent of President is

          needed.

iii)   On the aspect of repugnancy, he submitted that the letter of the

          Governor informing that the Bills were being reserved for the

          consideration of the President fails to specify the Central law with

          which States Bills are repugnant. This indicates non-application ofW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 34 of 414mind. He submitted that in Kaiser-I-Hind Pvt. Ltd. and Anr. v.
National Textile Corporation (Maharashtra North) Ltd. and Ors.

             reported in (2002) 8 SCC 182, a Constitution Bench of this Court

             held that the Central law with which repugnance exists must be

             pointed out by the proposal of State government specifically. Even

             the nature of repugnance should be stated so as to enable the

             President to consider the nature, extent, feasibility, practicality and

             desirability of assenting.

iv)   On the aspect of reading in a time limit within the scheme ofArticle

             200, he submitted that an outer limit of 2 to 3 months needs to be

             stipulated by this court to obviate exercise of pocket-veto by the

             Governors. Delays of over 3 months needs to be curbed.
32. Dr. Abhishek Manu Singhvi, the learned Senior Counsel appearing for the

    petitioner, made detailed submissions broadly on the following aspects:
Gubernatorial procrastination is a new phenomenon and requires

         judicial intervention for finding a new solution for it within the

         Constitutional framework.

v)    Placing reliance on the Constitution Bench decision inSamsher

         Singh(supra), he submitted that although the executive power of

         the State is vested in the Governor yet it is actually carried on by

         the Ministers under the Rules of Business made underArticle

         166(3).Further, the President or the Governor act on the aid and

         advice of the Council of Ministers with the Prime Minister as the

         head in the case of the Union and the Chief Minister as the head in

         the case of States, in all matters which vest in the Executive,

         irrespective of whether those functions are executive or legislative

         in character.

vi)   Referring to the observations made by a Constitution Bench of this

         Court in Nabam Rebia (supra), it was submitted that the Governor

         cannot be entrusted with such powers and functions as would assign

         to him a dominating position over the State Executive and the State

         Legislature. The Governor cannot be accepted as an all-pervading

         super-constitutional authority. It was submitted that an examination

         of the executive and legislative functions of the Governor in theW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 37 of 414context of the constitutional scheme clearly brings out that the

         Governor has not been assigned any substantive role either in the

         executive or the legislative functioning of the State.
vii) It was argued that this Court in Nabam Rabia (supra) has gone

         further to say that any exercise of discretionary powers of the

         Governor is limited to situations where a constitutional provision

         expressly provides that the Governor should act in his own

         discretion. Additionally, a Governor may exercise his functions in

         his own discretion in situations where the constitutional provision

         concerned cannot be construed otherwise and in situations where

         the clear intent underlying a constitutional provision so requires

         i.e., where the exercise of such power on the aid and advice, would

         run contrary to the constitutional scheme, or would be contradictory

         in terms.

viii) In response to our specific question as regards the observations

         made by this Court inB.K. Pavitra v. Union of Indiareported in

         (2019) 6 SCC 129, that the eventuality inArticle 254(2)does not

         exhaust the ambit of the power entrusted to the Governor underArticle 200to reserve a Bill for the consideration of the President,

         he submitted that the Governor may legitimately refer a bill forW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                         Page 38 of 414consideration at the end of the President upon entertaining a

         legitimate doubt about the validity of law. However, such reference

         of a bill can only be done with the aid and advice of the Council of

         Ministers and not upon the individual discretion of the Governor.
ix)   He further submitted that the said observations inB.K. Pavitra(supra) should be interpreted to mean that even though the power

         underArticle 200is entrusted to the Governor, yet such exercise of

         power can only be done with the aid and advice of the Council of

         Ministers of the State. The Governor has no independent discretion

         under the substantive part ofArticle 200for referring the bill for

         the consideration of the President. As is crystal clear from the

         Constituent Assembly Debates, there is no independent discretion

         vested in the Governor in exercise of his functions underArticle

         200of the Constitution. Although the power of reserving Bills for

         the consideration of the President is a necessary channel for

         references underArticle 254(2)to save the competence of the State

         Legislatures from being unduly restricted by the operation of the

         rule of repugnancy embodied in Clause (1) of theArticle 254, yet

         such power is also subject to the aid and advice of the Council of

         Ministers.
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 39 of 414
b) The Governor cannot reserve a bill for the consideration of the
   President when it is repassed by the State Legislature, with or
   without amendments, under the first proviso toArticle 200?
i)    Mr. Singhvi submitted that the relevant consideration at the end of

         the Governor when a bill is presented before him for assent broadly

         should be as follows:
If the answer is yes, then the Governor must reserve the Bill for

            the consideration of the President.
3. In all other cases, the Governor has three options to choose from

            when the bill is presented before him for the first time – to either

            assent, or withhold assent, or reserve the Bill for the consideration

            of the President.

ii)   He submitted that after the Governor has withheld assent to a bill

         and returned the same to the Legislative Assembly, it is not open to

         the Governor to reserve the said bill for the consideration of the

         President once the Legislative Assembly re-passes it with orW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                         Page 40 of 414without amendment. If the Governor wants to reserve any bill for

          the consideration of the President, he must do so in the first instance

          when the bill is presented to him for assent. The Governor can

          choose any one of the three options at the first instance but if he

          exercises the option to withhold assent, then the option of reserving

          the bill for the consideration of the President ceases to exist because

          the next step in such a case is to follow the procedure prescribed

          under first proviso toArticle 200.

iii)   Explaining the reason for the aforesaid, he submitted that upon

          exercising the second option, the third option no longer remains for

          the Governor as the first proviso toArticle 200comes into

          operation.Article 200does not provide any scope to the Governor

          for the reservation of the bill once the second option has already

          been exercised. The decision of the Governor to go down the path

          of sending the bill back to the Legislature precludes him from

          reversing his constitutional election subsequently, by referring it to

          the President after the Bill is returned to him consequent to

          repassing by the Legislature.
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                          Page 41 of 414
c) The first proviso toArticle 200is attached to the option of
   withholding of assent provided in the substantive part of the article.
i)    The concluding part of the first proviso stipulates that if the Bill is

         passed again by the Legislature either with or without amendments,

         the Governor shall not withhold assent therefrom upon

         presentation. The expression “shall not withhold assent therefrom”

         is a clear indicator that the exercise of the power under the first

         proviso is relatable to the withholding of the assent by the Governor

         to the bill in the first instance. This phrase constitutes a clear and

         unequivocal constitutional prohibition against the Governor. The

         role which is ascribed by the first proviso to the Governor is

         recommendatory in nature and it does not bind the State

         Legislature.

ii)   The first proviso toArticle 200expands upon the second option to

         ensure that the object of the Article is not rendered otiose as without

         the first proviso,Article 200would allow the Governor to

         indiscriminately veto bills by repetitively and sequentially

         withholding the assent and cripple an elected Government for

         political reasons.
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                         Page 42 of 414
iii)   On the use of the expression “may” in the first proviso toArticle

          200, placing reliance on the decision of this Court inState of Uttar

          Pradesh v. Jogendra Singhreported in AIR 1963 SC 1618 the

          counsel submitted that inthe said decisionwhile adjudicating the

          duty of the Governor to refer the cases relating to Government

          servants to the Administrative Tribunal under Rules 4(2) of the

          Civil Service Rules which also used the expression “may” this

          Court had held that the word “may” is capable of meaning “must”

          or “shall” in the light of the context. He further submitted that

          where a discretion is conferred upon a public authority coupled

          with an obligation, the word “may” which denotes discretion

          should be construed to mean a command. Sometimes, the

          legislature uses the word “may” out of deference to the high status

          of the authority on whom the power and the obligation are intended

          to be conferred and imposed.

iv)    The first part of the first proviso is mandatory in nature. It

          authorises the Governor to, as soon as possible, after the

          presentation for Bill for assent, return the Bill together with a

          message requesting the House to reconsider the Bill with the

          desirability of introducing any such amendments as he may

          recommend in his message. He submitted that this interpretationW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 43 of 414was also followed by this Court in the decision inState of Punjab(supra) by stating that Governor must mandatorily follow the

         course of action indicated in the first proviso of communicating to

         the State Legislature “as soon as possible” a message warranting

         reconsideration of the Bill.

v)    The Governor can only return the bill when he has withheld the

         assent. The Governor cannot be expected to keep the bill in his

         custody after withholding the assent as it would amount to a

         “pocket veto” or veto which is contrary to the intention of the

         makers of the Constitution. Any acceptance of such “suspended

         animation” doctrine of a Bill, supposedly kept indefinitely pending

         by a Governor, would be grossly violative of the Constitutional

         text, spirit and intent.

vi)   The counsel while highlighting the facts of the case at hand,

         submitted that the Governor had returned the Bills with the remarks

         “I withhold assent” which amounts to a clear withholding as per the

         second option of the substantive part ofArticle 200.When these

         Bills were returned to the Legislative Assembly, the Bills only

         contained a signed endorsement by the Governor with the remarks

         “I withhold assent” and there was no message for reconsideration.W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                     Page 44 of 414In such a situation of simpliciter withholding of assent, the State

           Legislative Assembly cannot be precluded from re-considering the

           Bill and re-passing the Bill as the exercise of the option of

           withholding of assent brings into operation the first proviso

           whereby such Bills have to be returned to the State Legislative

           Assembly.

vii) Once the first proviso comes into operation, the State Legislature is

           bound to mandatorily reconsider the Bills and pass them with or

           without any amendments as indicated by the expression “House or

           Houses shall reconsider the Bill accordingly” in the second part of

           the first proviso toArticle 200.

d)        A time-limit must be read into the expression “as soon as
          possible” appearing in the first proviso toArticle 200to curtail
          the prevalent practice of gubernatorial procrastination.
i)    He submitted that the expression “as soon as possible” provided in

           first proviso toArticle 200does not provide any strict time limit to

           be followed by the Governor to decide upon the Bills presented for

           assent, but that should not and cannot mean that the Governor can

           keep a Bill duly passed by the State Legislative Assembly

           “pending” for indeterminate periods. This course of action is

           inconsistent with the phrase “as soon as possible”.

ii)   The counsel placed reliance on the following decisions of this Court

         in support of his submission:
limit is fixed, it has to be exercised within a time which can be

            held to be reasonable.
•Keisham Meghachandra            Singh v.     Speaker, Manipur

            M/s Ashok Mills - CA No. 2669 of 2023 has held that where

            there is no time period prescribed by the statute, the Court must

            undertake a holistic assessment of the facts and circumstances,

            conduct of the parties, and the nature of the proceedings to

            examine the possibility of delay causing prejudice to a party.W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                          Page 46 of 414• AG Perarivalan v. State, Through Superintendent of Police

             CBI/SIT/MMDA, Chennai, Tamil Nadu and Anr. reported in

             (2023) 8 SCC 257 wherein while dealing with the delay caused

             by the Governor in deciding remission matters, this Court

             exercised its powers underArticle 142of the Constitution

             directing that the prisoner was deemed to have served the

             sentence.

iii)   Mr. Singhvi referred to Chapter V of the report of the Sarkaria

          Commission on Centre-State Administrative Relations wherein it

          was suggested that the Governor should make a declaration underArticle 200within one month from the date on which the Bill is

          presented. He also referred to the Punchhi Committee Report on

          Centre-State Relations which recommended “maximum period of

          six months after Bill is presented” to be the time limit to be

          followed by the Governor underArticle 200.

e) The observations made by this Court in its decision in Valluri
   Basavaiah Chowdhary are not applicable to the present case
i)     Mr. Singhvi submitted that this Court inValluri Basavaiah

          Chowdhary(supra) had no occasion to adjudicate upon theW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                   Page 47 of 414interpretation of the constitutional powers of the Governor underArticle 200of the Constitution. Therefore, the observations of the

          Court in Para 19 cannot be construed to be its ratio decidendi. At

          most, these observations could be considered as obiter dicta.

          Indeed, they may not even constitute obiter but are mere

          observations, totally unconnected to and unnecessary for that case.
ii)    He relied upon the decision of this Court in Secunderabad Club v.
Commissioner of Income-Tax reported in (2023) SCC OnLine

          SC 1004 to submit that in terms ofArticle 141of the Constitution,

          only the ratio decidendi of a judgment, that is, the reason assigned

          in support of the conclusion, is binding. He submitted that this

          Court has held that what is binding, therefore, is the principle

          underlying a decision which must be discerned in the context of the

          question(s) involvedin that casefrom which the decision takes its

          colour. In a subsequent case, a decision cannot be relied upon in

          support of a proposition that it did not decide. Therefore, the

          context or the question, while considering which, a judgment has

          been rendered assumes significance.

iii)   He submitted that the obiter dictum of the Supreme Court is binding

          underArticle 141to the extent of the observations on points raisedW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 48 of 414and decided by the court in a case. Although the obiter dictum of

         the Supreme Court is binding on all courts yet it only has persuasive

         authority as far as the Supreme Court itself is concerned.
iv)   He further submitted that a decision is not an authority for what can

         be read into it by implication or by assigning an assumed intention

         of the judges and inferring from it a proposition of law which the

         judges have not specifically or expresslylaid down inthe

         pronouncement.

v)    Lastly, he submitted that even if the decision inValluri Basavaiah

         Chowdhary(supra) is interpreted as a binding precedent, still such

         interpretation of theArticle 200would fall foul of the intention

         envisaged by the Constituent Assembly.

f) Role of the President underArticle 201.
i)    On the aspect of the position of the President underArticle 201, he

         submitted that the President is not required to mandatorily assent to

         the bill that is presented to him for his consideration after being

         repassed by the State Legislature, once such bill has been sent back

         by the President under the proviso toArticle 201in the first

         instance.
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 49 of 414
ii)    It was submitted thatArticle 201does not contain the expression

          “shall not withhold assent therefrom” in the proviso unlike the first

          proviso toArticle 200.He further submitted that this Court in

          Kaiser-I-Hind (supra) had held that the assent of the President

          envisaged underArticles 31-A, 31-C, 254(2)and304(b)of the

          Constitution respectively constitutes a distinct class and category

          of its own and is different from the assent envisaged underArticles

          111of the President orArticle 200of the Governor. A bare perusal

          ofArticle 201indicates that even when the Houses of the State

          Legislature re-pass the Bill and present it for consideration in terms

          of the proviso toArticle 201, there is no compulsion on the

          President to accord assent.

iii)   Just as the Governor, the President is also bound by the aid and

          advice of his Council of Ministers underArticle 201of the

          Constitution. Such absence of compulsion of the President to grant

          assent to the Bill re-considered and repassed by the State

          Legislative Assembly is also subject to the aid and advice of the

          Council of Ministers. Whether the President should grant assent or

          not would be subject to the aid and advice by the Council ofW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                         Page 50 of 414Ministers. There is no individual discretion vested in the President

         in granting or not granting the assent underArticle 201.
g) Malice in law and malice in fact
i)    He submitted that the Governor could be said to have committed

         violence to the constitutional framework by not adhering to the

         mandate underArticle 200of the Constitution and has also

         attempted to render the present Writ Petition infructuous during its

         pendency.

ii)   It was submitted that when the Petitioner had approached this Court

         initially, the Governor had kept 12 Bills pending. Thereafter, the

         captioned Writ Petitions were heard by this Court on 10.11.2023

         wherein it was observed that the present Writ Petition raised a

         matter of serious concern and issued notice to the Union of India

         represented by the Secretary to the Government in the Ministry of

         Home Affairs. In light of the aforesaid, the Governor hastily on

         13.11.2023 referred two Bills for the consideration of the President

         and withheld assent simpliciter to the remaining 10 Bills. On

         18.11.2023, a special session of Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly

         was held and the 10 Bills were reconsidered and passed in the

         Assembly. These Bills were sent to the Governor for considerationW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 51 of 414on the same day itself. However, the Governor, with a view to

                render the present petition infructuous, reserved the 10 Bills for the

                consideration of the President.

iii)   In the last, the learned counsel submitted that the action of the

                Governor has been contrary to what was laid down by this Court inS.R. Bommai(supra) wherein it was stated that the Governor is a

                very high Constitutional functionary and he is supposed to act fairly

                and honestly, in a manner consistent with his oath. It is for this

                reason thatArticle 356places such implicit faith on his report. If,

                however, in a given case his report is vitiated by legal mala fides,

                it is bound to vitiate the President's action as well.
33. Mr. P. Wilson, the learned Senior Counsel, made extensive submissions on

    behalf of the petitioner. For the sake of brevity, we are recording only those

    submissions which are in addition to the points already canvassed by Mr.

    Dwivedi and Mr. Singhvi respectively:
h. He submitted that on a proper reading of the substantive part and the

     first proviso toArticle 200, it will be seen that four courses of actions

     are available to the Governor. The observations made in theState of

     Punjab(supra) decision may thus warrant a qualification, or

     an additional statement to fine-tune the scope of Article 200.



i.   On the issue as regards whether the first proviso is attracted in all

     instances of withholding of assent, he submitted that the role for the first

     proviso is confined to cases where the bill may not be hit by anyW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                          Page 57 of 414constitutional limitation, is within the competence of the legislature, but

     may admit of changes, amendments, etc. Such amendments or changes

     that the Governor may thus suggest within the scope of the first proviso,

     will not be relatable to matters such as repugnancy. With the perception

     of repugnancy, the focus of the Governor will be outside the first

     proviso.He argued that even though this Court inState of Punjab(supra) has opined that the exercise of power under the first proviso is

     relatable to the withholding of the assent by the Governor, yet this view

     may require a further qualification that in the context of repugnancy,

     unlike any other reason for withholding of assent, the Governor need not

     necessarily proceed to act under the first proviso. The first proviso

     perhaps cannot be read to be pressed into service when both the

     Governor and the State Government understand the repugnancy

     dimension. In the event the State Government desires to clear the

     repugnancy or any other hurdle, it may itself seek the assent of the

     President. In such an event the State Government may also ask the

     Governor to refer the matter to the President for consideration.j.   He submitted that that in the present case as the President has withheld

     assent to the Bills in question, therefore in terms of the statement of law

     in Hoechst Pharamaceuticals (supra), the action of the President in

     withholding assent is not justiciable. What cannot be directly done byW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                         Page 58 of 414seeking such justiciability cannot be indirectly achieved by the claim

         that the action of the Governor in forwarding the bills in question to the

         President was beyond his authority.
k. He submitted that the exposition ofArticle 200as done inState of

         Punjab(supra) is sub-silentio as the Court while makingthe said

         decisiondid not take into account the observations made by the

         Constitution Bench inValluri Basavaiah(supra).
l.   In the last, he submitted that the matter may be referred to a larger Bench

         of this Court so as to harmonise the observations made inB.K. Pavitra(supra),Valluri Basavaiah(supra) andState of Punjab(supra).
35. Mr. Vikramjit Banerjee, the learned Additional Solicitor General, appeared

    for the respondents and submitted as follows:
c. Placing      reliance    on    the    decision     of      this    Court     inPurushothaman Nambudiri v. State of Keralareported in 1961 SCC

           OnLine SC 361 he submitted that the idea of reading in a time limit inArticles 200and201respectively had been deliberated upon and

           expressly rejected by this Court inthe said decision.
C.        ISSUES FOR CONSIDERATION
36. Having heard the learned counsel appearing for the parties and having gone

      through the materials on record, the following questions of paramount

      constitutional importance fall for our determination:
i. Whether the first proviso could be said to provide an independent

                 course of action available to the Governor in addition to the three

                 options provided under the substantive part ofArticle 200?ii. In what manner the expression “the Bill falls through unless the

                 procedure under the first proviso is followed”, as used inValluri

                 Basavaiah Chowdhary(supra), should be construed?
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                            Page 61 of 414iii. Whether the decision of this Court inState of Punjab(supra)

            could be said to be per incuriam for not having taken into

            consideration the observations made in previous decisions

            rendered by larger benches of this Court?
iv. Whether the scheme ofArticle 200of the Constitution envisages

            the exercise of ‘absolute veto’ or ‘pocket veto’ of a bill by the

            Governor?
II)    Whether the Governor can reserve a bill for the consideration of
       the President at the time when it is presented to him for assent after
       being reconsidered in accordance with the first proviso toArticle
       200, more particularly, when he had not reserved it for the
       consideration of the President in the first instance and had
       declared withholding of assent thereto?
i. Whether the reservation by the Governor, for the consideration of

           the President of the ten Bills which were repassed by the Tamil

           Nadu State Assembly and presented to the Governor on

           18.11.2023, is erroneous in law and hence liable to be set aside?



III)   Whether there is an express constitutionally prescribed time-limit
       within which the Governor is required to act in the exercise of his
       powers underArticle 200of the Constitution?
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 62 of 414i. How is the absence of an express time-limit inArticle 200to be

          construed for ascertaining the manner in which the Governor is

          expected to exercise his powers under the said provision?

      ii. What is the import of the expression “as soon as possible”

          appearing in the first proviso toArticle 200?
iii. Whether a time-limit can be prescribed by this Court for ensuring

          that the exercise of power by the Governor underArticle 200is in

          conformity with the object of expediency underlying the scheme of

          the said provision?
IV)   Whether the Governor in the exercise of his powers underArticle
      200of the Constitution can only act in accordance with the aid and
      advice tendered to him by the State Council of Ministers? If not,
      whether the constitutional scheme has vested the Governor with
      some discretion in discharge of his functions underArticle 200?i. How has the role of the Governor been envisaged under the

          constitutional scheme?
ii. Whether the Governor enjoys a certain degree of discretion in

          discharge of his functions in contrast to the President? What is the

          source of such discretion, if any?
iii. Whether the deletion of the expression “in his discretion” fromArticle 175of the Draft Constitution imply that the Governor hasW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 63 of 414no discretion available in the exercise of his powers underArticle

          200?
iv. Whether the observations of this Court inB.K. Pavitra(supra) that

          “a discretion is conferred upon the Governor to follow one of the

          courses of action enunciated in the substantive part of Article 200”

          could be said to be per incuriam for having failed to notice the

          position of law aslaid down bythe larger Benches of this Court?



V)    Whether the exercise of discretion by the Governor in discharge of
      his functions underArticle 200could be said to be subject to
      judicial review? If yes, what are the parameters for such judicial
      review?
i. Whether the discharge of functions by the Governor underArticle

          200of the Constitution in his discretion could be said to be immune

          from judicial review?
ii. Whether the withholding of assent by the President underArticle

          201of the Constitution could also be said to be beyond the scope

          of judicial scrutiny?
iii. If the aforesaid discharge of functions is subject to judicial review,

          whether such discharge of functions could be said to be non-

          justiciable in light of the decisions of this Court in Hoechst

          (supra), Kaiser-I-Hind (supra), andB.K. Pavitra(supra)?W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                         Page 64 of 414VI)   What is the manner in which the President underArticle 201of the
           Constitution is required to act once a bill has been reserved for his
           consideration by the Governor underArticle 200of the
           Constitution?
i. Whether the decision of the President to withhold assent underArticle 201of the Constitution could be said to be justiciable? If

               yes, what is the extent of justiciability that the courts can embark

               upon while undertaking judicial review of the exercise of powers

               by the President underArticle 201of the Constitution?
D.     ASSENT TO BILLS – HISTORICAL BACKGROUND
37.Article 200appears in Chapter III of Part VI of the Constitution under the

      heading Legislative Procedure. Part VI deals with the States and Chapter III

      deals with the State Legislature. The marginal note attached toArticle 200reads “Assent to Bills” and the article reads as follows:
38.Section 75of the Government of India Act, 1935 (for short, “the GoI Act,

    1935”) upon which theArticle 200has been substantially modelled is

    reproduced hereinbelow:
39. A perusal of both the aforesaid provisions indicates thatArticle 200of the

     Constitution corresponds to Section 75 of the GoI Act, 1935 except for the

     following differences:
40. D.D. Basu in his Commentary on the Constitution of India (pp. 6311, 8th

     Ed., 2009) has observed that the omission of the expression “in his

     discretion” fromArticle 200signifies that the Governor must exercise his

     power under the Article according to the advice of his ministers. Further, theW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 67 of 414addition of the expression “shall not withhold assent therefrom” indicates

     that the Governor has no power to veto a reconsidered bill and must assent

     to it whether it is passed in the original form or with amendments.
41.Article 200is divided into three parts - the substantive part and two provisos.
A perusal of the substantive part ofArticle 200indicates that the

     presentation of a bill to the Governor is mandatory after it is passed by the

     State legislature. The same is made evident from the use of the expression

     “it shall be presented to the Governor”. In the same breath,Article 200makes it mandatory for the Governor to make one of the following

     declarations:
42. It is important to note that the expression “shall” has been used to qualify

     the three types of declarations that the Governor can make upon presentation

     of the bill to him. Further, the three options provided in the substantive part

     ofArticle 200are connected by the conjunction “or” which signifies that the

     three options are mutually exclusive of each other, and the Governor can

     only choose one of them at a time. In other words, the Governor cannot

     assent to a bill and also reserve it for the consideration of the President atW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 68 of 414the same time. Similarly, the Governor cannot declare that he withholds

assent and also reserve the bill for the consideration of the President at the

same time. Patanjali Sastri, Chief Justice (as he then was), observed to this

effect inState of Bihar v. Kameshwar Singhreported in (1952) 1 SCC 528

as follows:
43. The first proviso toArticle 200has no application to Money Bills. For all

    other bills, it provides that the Governor may, as soon as possible after the

    presentation of the bill to him for assent, return the bill to the House or

    Houses along with a message requesting the House or the Houses to

    reconsider the bill in totality or certain provisions thereof. He may also

    recommend the introduction of certain amendments to the bill. The first

    proviso further states that when a bill is returned with such a message, then

    the House or the Houses must reconsider the bill accordingly and if the bill

    is passed with or without amendments and presented to the Governor for

    assent, he shall not withhold assent therefrom.

44. The second proviso toArticle 200provides that if the Governor is of the

    opinion that a bill which is presented to him for assent would, upon

    becoming law, so derogate from the powers of the High Court as to endanger

    the position which that Court is designed to fill by the Constitution, then he

    must reserve the bill for the consideration of the President and not grant

    assent to it.

45. The heart of the controversy before us lies in the interpretation of the

    substantive part ofArticle 200and the first proviso to it. The arguments

    advanced before us coupled with the factual situation which we are

    confronted with, and the broader constitutional and political consequencesW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 70 of 414that an interpretation ofArticle 200entails, has opened up before us a

     treasure trove of questions hidden in the seemingly innocuous and plain

     language used inArticle 200.

46. For a better understanding ofArticle 200, it is necessary that we should first

     understand the concept of assent to bills, how it has evolved over the

     centuries and its importance in parliamentary democracies across the globe.

     We are undertaking this exercise asArticle 200cannot be understood fully

     without having regard to the context in which it came to be included in the

     Constitution. While fidelity to the text of the provision holds paramount

     consideration in its interpretation, the context is equally, if not more,

     important, more so in light of the fact thatArticle 200, as its stands today,

     bears striking resemblance to Section 75 of the GoI Act, 1935 and other

     important historical documents which were being drafted by Indians during

     the course of the freedom struggle.

47. In Westminster styled polities, the Parliament consists of a lower House, an

     upper House and the head of state. The Indian Constitution has also broadly

     adopted a similar structure, which becomes evident fromArticles 79and168respectively.Article 79provides that the Parliament shall consist of the

     President and two Houses - the Council of States and the House of the

     People.Article 168provides that each State shall have a Legislature whichW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 71 of 414shall comprise of the Governor and either one or two House(s), as the case

      may be. In the Westminster system, for a law to be passed by the Parliament,

      it must receive the approval of all the three elements - the Lower House, the

      Upper House and the Head of the State.

48. Jessica J. Richardson2 in her paper titled “Modernisation of Royal Assent in

      Canada”, has traced the historical origins of the practice of granting assent

      to bills enacted by the Parliament in the United Kingdom. She has explained

      that the practice of signifying royal assent to bills passed by Parliament

      began during the reign of Henry VI (1422-71), when the practice of

      introducing bills in the form of petitions was replaced by bills in the form of

      complete statutes. This was a time when assent was granted in person. The

      Sovereign would attend the Parliament in the House of Lords and give his

      consent in person. This practice continued until 1541, when the task of

      signifying royal assent was assigned to a Royal Commission in order to

      spare King Henry VIII the indignity of having to give royal assent to the Bill

      of Attainder, which provided for the execution of his wife Catherine

      Howard. It was after this occurrence that the practice of appointing Lords

      Commissioners responsible for giving royal assent developed. In the United

      Kingdom, the last instance of a monarch giving royal assent in person was2Jessica J. Richardson, Modernisation of Royal Assent in Canada, 27 CAN. PARLIAM. REV.2, 32 (2004),
<http://www.revparl.ca/27/2/27n2_04e_Richardson.pdf>.W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                                   Page 72 of 414in 1854 when Queen Victoria personally assented to several bills prior to

     proroguing the Parliament. However, in Canada, King George VI gave royal

     assent in person to bills passed by the Canadian Parliament in 1939 during

     a visit to Canada. The use of a royal assent ceremony continued in the United

     Kingdom until 1967, when the British Parliament passed the Royal Assent

     Act, 1967. The said legislation repealed the Royal Assent by Commission

     Act, 1541 and allowed a simple report of royal assent by the Speakers of the

     two Houses to give a bill the force of law.

49. In the Canadian context, she explains that the royal assent ceremony was

     inherited from the United Kingdom tradition and was used prior to

     Confederation in both Lower and Upper Canada and closely resembled the

     original ceremony used in the United Kingdom. Prior to adoption of the new

     procedure in 2002, Canada was the only remaining Commonwealth country

     to still use the traditional ceremony for royal assent. However, taking

     inspiration from the practice prevailing in other Commonwealth countries

     including Australia and New Zealand, as well as several Canadian

     provinces, the royal assent procedure was modernised by adopting a written

     declaration procedure.

50. One of the first instances where the concept of assent to bills appears in a

     documented form in the Indian context is the Constitution of India Bill, 1895W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 73 of 414which is also popularly referred to as the Swaraj Bill. The Bill, which is also

    termed by the academics as the first articulation of a constitutional

    imagination by Indians, besides incorporating ideas of free speech, equality

    before law, right to property, etc., also envisaged a machinery of governance

    and separation of powers, albeit within the British Empire. As regards the

    legislative structure, the Bill proposed that the Sovereign of Great Britain

    shall reign and rule over India and the Viceroy shall be the representative of

    the Sovereign in India. It further envisaged that the Viceroy would be the

    President of the Parliament and would have the power to veto any law

    enacted by the Indian Parliament and initiate legislation.Article 97of the

    Bill provided that no bill would become law until it received the sanction of

    the Sovereign. The said provision is reproduced hereinbelow:
51. A few years after the ideation of the Swaraj Bill, the demand for self-

    government further found expression in the Congress-League Scheme of

    1916 which was a result of deliberations of the committees constituted

    jointly by the Indian National Congress and the All India Muslim League.

    The document envisioned a federal polity - with Provincial Legislative

    Councils for the provinces and an Imperial Legislative Council at theW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 74 of 414national level. It is pertinent to note that as per the scheme, the Governor

was envisaged as the head of the provincial government and any bill passed

by the provincial legislature had to mandatorily receive his assent before it

became law. Further, the document also conferred upon the Governor-

General the power of vetoing any law passed by the provincial legislature.

Any bill passed by the Imperial Legislative Council had to receive the assent

of the Governor-General before it became law. The relevant provisions in

the said document are reproduced hereinbelow:
II. Provincial Governments
1. The head of every Provincial Government shall be a
        Governor who shall not ordinarily belong to the Indian Civil
        Service or any of the permanent services.
9. All Bills passed by the Council shall have to receive the
        assent of the Governor-General before they become law.”W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 75 of 414
52. In the backdrop of the growing demand for self-government by the Indian

    National Movement and the Montagu-Chelmsford Report, the Government

    of India Act, 1919 (for short, “the GoI Act, 1919”) was enacted and received

    assent of the British Crown in December, 1919. The legislation introduced

    dyarchy at the provincial level, by the introduction of the transferred list and

    the reserved list. The reserved list consisted of the subject matters on which

    the Governor enjoyed exclusive legislative powers. However, what we wish

    to draw attention to is the provision contained in the said legislation as

    regards assent to bills.Section 12provided that the Governor had four

    options to choose from when a bill was presented to him for assent - to

    declare assent, to withhold assent, to return the bill to the council for

    reconsideration or to reserve the bill for the consideration of the Governor-

    General. Notably, there was no requirement for the Governor to mandatorily

    assent to a bill upon its presentation after reconsideration. Further, the

    Governor had the power to veto any bill passed by the legislative council by

    a declaration simplicter of withholding of assent. There was also a provision

    for the lapse of a bill reserved for the consideration of the Governor-General

    if assent was not granted within a period of six months. Thus, the concept of

    both absolute and pocket veto could be said to have been available to the

    Governor and the Governor-General under the provisions of the GoI Act,

    1919. The relevant provision is reproduced hereinbelow:
governor or chief commissioner relating thereto, the
            Bill, if re-affirmed with or without amendment, may
            be again presented to the governor, lieutenant-
governor, or chief commissioner:
53. A reading of the aforesaid provision also indicates that at the time of draftingArticle 200, the framers of the Constitution not only had before them Section

     75 of the GoI Act, 1935 but also Section 12 of the GoI Act, 1919 as well as

     other possible variations about which we shall discuss in the following

     paragraphs. However, certain features ofArticle 200, namely, the absence

     of automatic lapse upon not receiving approval, mandatory requirement for

     the Governor to not withhold assent to a bill which is presented to him after

     being reconsidered by the legislature and absence of the expression “in his

     discretion”, must be viewed in the context of gradual dilution of the role andW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                         Page 78 of 414powers of the Governor in provincial governance as the country neared

         independence.
i.       Concept of assent to bills as envisaged by certain historical documents
         drafted during the freedom struggle.
54. The concept of assent by the Sovereign found mention in Section 75 of the

         GoI Act, 1935 andArticle 200as it stands today is predominantly modelled

         according to the version which existed therein. However, before we proceed

         to discuss Section 75 of the GoI Act, 1935 and how it eventually evolved

         intoArticle 200of the Constitution, we deem it appropriate to briefly shed

         light on how other aspirational constitutional documents, drafted during the

         course of the freedom struggle, imagined the practice of assent to bills and

         made certain modifications to the practice that prevailed in the United

         Kingdom.

55. The Commonwealth of India Bill, 1925 that was drafted by the National

         Convention had a lasting impact on the eventual framing of our Constitution

         as regards the idea of royal assent.Article 39of the said Bill provided that a

         bill passed by the Parliament would be presented to the Viceroy for

         obtaining the King’s assent. Similarly, for the provinces,Article 83provided

         that the bills passed by the provincial legislature would be presented to the

         Governor for obtaining the King’s assent. However, what is relevant to noteW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                         Page 79 of 414is that the provisions were not elaborate as regards the procedure and scope

     of powers of the Sovereign while taking a decision on the aspect of assent.
56. However, the Nehru Report of 1928 shortly followed the Commonwealth of

     India Bill, 1925 and was drafted in response to the dissatisfaction with the

     Simon Commission. The Report sought to negative the challenge posed by

     the British that a constitutional document, which is agreeable to all, could

     not be drawn by Indians, and contained elaborate provisions providing the

     mechanism for the purpose of assent to bills.

57. As regards the bills passed by the Parliament, it was stipulated in the Nehru

     Report that a bill would not become an Act until assent was granted by the

     Governor-General. The Governor-General was provided with three options
- to signify assent, to withhold assent or to reserve the bill for consideration

     by the British Crown. Notably, there was no obligation on the Governor-

     General to signify assent after a bill was repassed with or without the

     amendments suggested by him. The relevant provision is reproduced

     hereinbelow:
General for the signification in the King’s name of the King’s
            assent.”
58. As regards the provincial legislature, a bill passed by the provincial

    legislature had to be assented to by the Governor before it would become an

    Act. The Governor had two options - to declare assent or to withhold assent.

    Notably, the Governor did not have the option to reserve the bill for the

    consideration of the Governor-General. However, every bill after receiving

    the assent of the Governor had to be mandatorily referred to and assented by

    the Governor-General failing which the Act would have no validity. Even

    after receiving the assent of the Governor-General, the Act could beW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 81 of 414disallowed by the King and would thereupon become void. The relevant

    provisions are reproduced hereinbelow:
General has assented thereto and that assent has been
            signified by the Governor-General to, and published by the
            Governor.
40. Where the Governor-General withholds his assent from
            any such Act, he shall signify to the Governor in writing his
            reason for so withholding his assent.
41. When an Act has been assented to by the Governor-
General it shall be lawful for His Majesty in Council to
            signify his disallowance of the Act.
42. Where the disallowance of an Act has been so signified,
            the Governor shall forthwith notify the disallowance, and
            thereupon the Act, as from the date of the notification shall
            become void accordingly.”
59. In 1944, the All India Hindu Mahasabha adopted the Constitution of

    Hindustan Free State Act as an aspirational constitutional document. AsW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 82 of 414regards the procedure of assent by Governor in provinces, the document

    contained the following provision:
60. A perusal of the above indicates that the Governor had the option of either

    assenting to or withholding a bill presented before him. However, in the

    latter case, the Governor was under an obligation to return the bill for

    reconsideration with his own recommendations, whereupon the provincial

    legislature was required to reconsider the bill in light of the

    recommendations made. Upon being passed again, with or without

    amendments, the bill would be deemed to have been assented to by theW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 83 of 414Governor. However, it would become an Act only upon being assented to

    by the President, who would signify his assent to the Governor. Thus, the

    President was vested with the power to veto any bill which had not been

    assented to by the Governor and was passed again after reconsideration with

    or without the amendments recommended by the Governor. This was in

    contrast to the position with respect to the Federal Legislature, wherein no

    veto power was conferred on the President. The relevant provision read as

    follows:
61. One more document that we would like to refer to is the “Constitution of

    Free India: A Draft” authored by M.N. Roy in 1944. The document proposedW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 84 of 414a radically different version of assent to bills as distinguished from the

     scheme prevailing under the GoI Act, 1935 or other contemporaneous

     aspirational constitutional documents. The document vested no authority in

     the Governor to withhold assent to a bill passed by the provincial legislature

     or to veto the same. However, the document vested power in the Supreme

     People’s Legislature, which was a joint sitting of both the chambers of the

     Federal Legislature, to veto any provincial legislation. However, this veto

     power was subject to judicial review and the provincial government was

     given the right to challenge the veto before the Supreme Federal Court. The

     relevant provisions are reproduced hereinbelow:
62. What is interesting to note is that the imagination of a provision as regards

     assent to bills, when the country was on the brink of becoming independentW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 85 of 414from the British rule, was significantly different from the previous versions

     envisaged in times when the freedom struggle was focused more on

     obtaining greater degree of self-rule while being under the sovereignty of

     the British Crown, as can be seen in the versions used in the Nehru Report

     and the Constitution of India Bill, 1925. The two documents which were

     drafted in 1944, and arereferred to above, indicate that the Governor was

     vested with lesser powers and discretion, and there was a clear inclination

     towards a more unitary arrangement insofar as assent to bills was concerned.

     The ideas of judicial review of exercise of veto by the President against a

     state legislation, mandatory return of the bills for reconsideration upon

     withholding of assent, and deemed assent upon reconsideration were being

     experimented with among others in the immediate lead up to the framing of

     our Constitution.

63. Besides the aspirational constitutional documentsreferred to above, it is also

     pertinent to discuss how assent was envisaged by one of the first indigenous

     constitutional documents that was implemented in practice as well. Section

     15 of the Aundh State Constitution Act, 1939 that was purportedly enacted

     to grant self-rule to the people of the Aundh princely state, laid down the

     procedure for assent to bills. The relevant provision read as follows:
However, the Governor continued to have some special responsibilities and

     he also possessed discretionary powers to act in situations such as prevention

     of grave menace to the peace or tranquility of the province, safeguarding the

     legitimate interests of minorities and so on. The Governor could also act in

     his discretion in specified matters. He functioned under the generalW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 88 of 414superintendence and control of the Governor-General, whenever he acted in

     his individual judgement or discretion.

68. It is interesting to note that while the framing of the Constitution was being

     undertaken by the Constituent Assembly, the GoI Act, 1935 as adapted by

     the India (Provisional Constitution) Order, 1947 was made applicable for

     the administration of the country. By way of paragraph 3 of the said order,

     the expressions “in his discretion”, “acting in his discretion” and “exercising

     his individual judgement” were removed/deleted from wherever they

     occurred in the GoI Act, 1935. Paragraph 3 read thus:
69.Article 147of the Draft Constitution, prepared by the constitutional adviser,

     Shri B.N. Rau, dealt with assent to bills passed by the provincial legislature

     and read as follows:
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 89 of 414
70.Article 147as reproduced aforesaid made significant departure from Section

    75 of the GoI Act, 1935 as follows:
ii.   Debates of the Constituent Assembly onArticle 200of the Constitution
72. WhenArticle 175of the Draft Constitution, 1948 was taken up for

      consideration by the Constituent Assembly, certain amendments were

      moved by Dr. B.R. Ambedkar that came to be accepted, leading to the

      adoption of the draftArticle 175asArticle 200of our Constitution. The

      amendments were:
73. With a view to better understand the intention of the framers of the

        Constitution, it is of utmost importance that we turn the pages of the debates

        that took place in the Constituent Assembly.

74. On the 30th of July, 1949, Dr. B.R. Ambedkar moved an amendment, as

        discussed aforesaid, for the substitution of the first proviso under draftArticle 175, which later came to be successfully adopted by the Constituent

        Assembly. While moving for the substitution and highlighting that

        predominantly three key changes were sought to be made to the first proviso,

        he remarked that the words “in his discretion” under the draftArticle 175were sought to be deleted because it was felt that “in a responsible

        government, there can be no room for the Governor acting on discretion”3.

        Shri. Brajeshwar Prasad was not whole-heartedly in favor of the changes

        suggested to the first proviso and contended that they would strip the

        Governor of the power to veto a bill or reserve it for the consideration of the

        President, in his own discretion or initiative and he would be able to do so39, CONSTITUENT ASSEMB. DEB., (July 30, 1949) 41.
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 92 of 414only when so advised by his Cabinet of Ministers. In his opinion, the change

    also meant that the Governor would not be able to veto a bill that has been

    passed twice by the Legislative Assembly, which he felt was not acceptable.
75. Shri. Brajeshwar Prasad acknowledged that there are two classes of cases in

    which a bill can be reserved for the consideration of the President – One,

    where a certain Article of the Constitution requires the same and two, when

    the Governor is advised by his Ministry to do so. However, he advocated for

    a third category i.e., where the Governor would possess the power, in his

    discretion, to veto a bill passed by the Legislature, irrespective of whether it

    was passed once or twice by it. He supported the vesting of discretion in the

    hands of the Governor so that he could veto unjust and unsound legislation

    while also ensuring that there is a check on potentially disruptive legislative

    tendencies. From his standpoint, the fear of disruptive legislation was not

    imaginary but real in our country and he advocated that his proposal was in

    consonance with the traditions of the centralized system of Government that

    existed in our country until independence. He was of the view that the

    parliamentary form of polity was a new experiment to the facts of life in our

    country and it was required to be moderated and regulated. Expressing his

    lack of confidence in the provincial Ministers, he contended that

    empowering the Governor to act in his discretion would not be so

    objectionable since the Governor is also the representative of theW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                         Page 93 of 414Government of India and it is by virtue of this position that his views must

        prevail over those of the State legislature.

76. On the other hand, during the course of the debate, Shri. Shibban Lal Saxena,

        addressed the practical realities of assigning such a discretion to the

        Governor who is a nominee of the President, especially when the party in

        power in the province may not be the same as the party in power at the

        Centre. In such a scenario, it was his opinion that, “it will introduce a very

        wrong principle to give the Governor this power to go against the express

        wish of the Assembly and even of the council”4.

77. Shri. T.T. Krishnamachari also emphasized that under the newly proposed

        draftArticle 175, more specifically the first proviso, the Governor will not

        be exercising his discretion in the matter of referring a bill back to the House

        with a message. The Governor would exercise his power under the first

        proviso only upon the advice of his Council of Ministers. According to him,

        the first proviso was to be exercised in situations wherein the House has

        already accepted and endorsed a provision, but the Ministry was of the

        opinion that certain modifications are required to be made in the said

        provision. It is only when such an occasion arises that the procedure49, CONSTITUENT ASSEMB. DEB., (Aug. 1, 1949) 61.
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                         Page 94 of 414envisaged under the first proviso would be resorted to. The Council of

        Ministers would use the Governor to hold up further proceedings of the bill

        and remit it to the Lower House with the message informing the legislature

        about the modifications sought to be made to the bill by the Ministry. He

        drew attention to the words of Dr. Ambedkar on this aspect and stated as

        follows:
78. The first proviso, according to him, was therefore a saving clause which

        vested power in the hands of the Ministry to remedy a hasty action that they59, CONSTITUENT ASSEMB. DEB., (Aug. 1, 1949) 61.
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                         Page 95 of 414might have undertaken with respect to the bill in question, or, it could also

     be seen as providing some scope to the Ministry to take certain additional

     actions that the Ministry feels should be taken in order to meet the popular

     opinion reflected outside the House in some form or another. Therefore, the

     operation of the first proviso does not abridge the power of the Legislature

     or the Ministry responsible to it, rather, it further curtails the Governor’s

     power from the position that was envisaged in the original first proviso,

     which is now sought to be supplanted.

79. In light of the debate which took place as regards the substitution of the first

     proviso to draftArticle 175, the amendment was put to vote and the same

     was successfully adopted by the Constituent Assembly.
80. On 17th of October, 1949, T.T. Krishnamachari moved an amendment that a

     second proviso toArticle 175also be added, which later came to be adopted

     by the Constituent Assembly. Dr. B.R. Ambedkar elucidated that the second

     proviso that was proposed to be moved, was a part of the Instrument of

     Instructions issued to the Governor of the provinces under the GoI, 1935.

     Paragraph 17 of the Instrument of Instructions read as follows:
81. Such a clause was initially supposed to be included in the Fourth Schedule

    that separately contained instructions to the Governors of the States.

    However, since it was considered unnecessary to have such a separate

    Schedule, this particular aspect was sought to be brought in as second

    proviso to the draftArticle 175.A need to incorporate the second proviso

    was felt because the High Courts were placed under the legislative

    competence of the Centre as well as the States. In so far as the organization

    and territorial jurisdiction of the High Court was concerned, the power

    remained with the Centre. However, with regard to the pecuniary

    jurisdiction and the jurisdiction in relation to any of the matters which are

    mentioned under List II, the power rests with different States. Therefore,

    there could arise a scenario wherein the State legislature would enact a bill

    which would derogate from the powers of the High Court. For example,

    passing a bill that reduces the pecuniary jurisdiction of the High Court by

    raising the value of the suit that may be entertained by the High Court. This

    would be one method whereby the State legislature would diminish the

    authority of the High Court. Furthermore, a bill could also affect the subject-

    matter jurisdiction of a High Court. For example, in enacting any measure

    under any of the entries contained in List II, say, debt cancellation, it would

    be open for the provinces or States to say that the decree made by any suchW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 97 of 414Court or Board shall be final and conclusive, and that the High Court should

        not have any jurisdiction in the matter at all. In light of such possibilities, it

        was felt that the second proviso to draftArticle 175must be added.
82. It was the opinion of Dr. B.R. Ambedkar that any such bill or Act as

        illustrated above would amount to a derogation from the authority that the

        Constitution confers or intends to confer upon the High Court. This is why

        it was felt necessary that before such a law becomes final, the President must

        be given an opportunity to examine whether such a law should be permitted

        to take effect or not. Such a shield was considered imperative keeping in

        mind the important constitutional position that the High Courts hold in

        adjudicating disputes. Dr. B.R. Ambedkar had emphasized on the

        importance of the second proviso as follows:
Allegations also came to be levelled by a number of State Governments that

     the Governor in a number of States was acting as an agent of the Central

     Government and the objectivity that was expected of the Governor was not

     being displayed, more particularly when it came to reservation of bills for

     the consideration of the President or recommendation for the imposition of

     emergency underArticle 356.In light of the aforesaid, certain commissions

     came to be constituted which submitted their reports after undertaking

     exhaustive analysis of the working of the constitutional machinery

     prescribed for Centre-State relations. One of the key foci of these reports

     was the working ofArticles 200and201of the Constitution respectively

     and the scope of exercise of discretion by the Governors, which we deem

     appropriate to discuss hereinafter.
i.    First Administrative Reforms Commission, 1966.
85. The First Administrative Reforms Commission (the “ARC”) was

     established in January 1966 by a resolution of the Ministry of Home Affairs

     to examine the public administration of the country and make

     recommendations for reform and reorganization where necessary. An aspect

     of this exercise was the examination of Centre-State relations particularlyW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                   Page 100 of 414with respect to the need for national integration, and for maintaining

    efficient standards of administration throughout the country.
86. While examining the various facets of Centre-State relations, the

    Commission found it apposite to discuss the role of the Governor in the

    political context which existed back then. Taking note of the skirmishes

    between the State governments and Governors, the Commission was of the

    view that the Governor’s office ceased to be merely ornamental and

    ceremonial. This changed role demanded a scrutiny of the discretionary

    powers of the Governor.

87. As the discretionary powers of the Governor affect some of the vital issues

    in the functioning of democratic governments in the States, the ARC

    underscored the importance of evolving guidelines to enable the exercise of

    such discretionary powers for the purpose of preserving and protecting

    democratic values. It was noted that such guidelines would serve the purpose

    of securing uniformity in action and eliminate all suspicions of partisanship

    and arbitrariness.

88. The ARC, therefore, recommended the following:
89. However, no such guidelines have been formulated by the Inter-State

      Council till date and none of the Commissions on Centre-State relations

      constituted thereafter made any recommendations on the issuance of

      guidelines for exercise of discretion by the Governor.
ii.    Rajamannar Commission, 1971
90. The Rajamannar Commission was set up by the Government of Tamil Nadu

      in 1969 under the chairmanship of Dr. P.V. Rajamannar to look into the

      question regarding the relationship that should subsist between the Centre

      and States in a federal set-up. The Commission noted that in the changed

      political circumstances, there can be no dispute regarding the fact that the

      Governors have a positive role to play in the stability and progress of States.

      This requires that the authority of the Governor should be clearly spelt out

      and the Governors should no longer consider themselves to be instruments

      of the Centre under compulsion to act on its directions and in its political

      interests.
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 102 of 414
91. One of the questions on which the Commission addressed itself was whether

    the Constitution provides for the exercise of any power by the Governor in

    his discretion that is, whether the Governor could exercise any of his

    functions without consulting the Ministry or contrary to the aid and advice

    tendered by the Council of Ministers.

92. To answer this question, the Commission adverted to the history of the

    making of the Constitution and concluded that the Constitution does not

    provide for the issue of any instructions to the Governor, nor does it vest any

    discretionary powers in express terms in the Governor, except in relation to

    certain specified matters. While referring to certain judicial pronouncements

    of this Court as well as Granville Austin’s seminal work on the Indian

    Constitution, the Commission opined that the discretion of the Governor

    must be limited to those matters in respect of which there are express

    provisions in the Constitution. The relevant portion of the report is

    reproduced below:
93. The Commission observed that while exercising his functions, the Governor

    should not be under any pressure from an external authority. To explain the

    position of discretionary powers of the Governor, the Commission referred

    to the speech of the former Vice President of India, Shri G.S. Pathak, which

    reads thus:
94. However, in the same vein, it was also noted that the Governor has to

    function in a dual capacity as (1) the appointee of the central government;W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 104 of 414and (2) the constitutional head of the State. This is because the Central

       Government retains the power to appoint and remove the Governor,

       therefore, the Governor cannot but look to the Central Government for

       guidance in the discharge of his duties.

95. The Commission was of the opinion that it is necessary to indicate at least a

       broad outline of the principles that should guide the Governor in the exercise

       of discretion, if any, vested in him. It was observed that the evolution of

       rules and guidelines in this respect is especially important in order to

       reconcile the actions of the Governor in his capacity as an agent of the Centre

       and the head of the State Executive.

96. Having discussed the discretion of the Governor in matters of constitutional

       decision-making at length, the Commission recommended that a specific

       provision should be inserted in the Constitution to enable the President to

       issue Instruments of Instructions to the Governors laying down guidelines

       or principles with reference to which the Governor should act including the

       occasions for the exercise of discretionary powers.
iii.    Sarkaria CommissionW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 105 of 414
97. In June 1983, the Central government headed by the former Prime Minister

    of India, Ms. Indira Gandhi, formally constituted a commission to examine

    and review the working of the arrangements between the Union and States

    in regard to powers, functions and responsibilities in all spheres and to

    recommend such changes or other measures as may be deemed appropriate.

    The said commission was formed under the chairmanship of a former judge

    of this Court, Justice R.S. Sarkaria and hence, came to be known as the

    Sarkaria Commission.

98. The Sarkaria Commission was enjoined with the task of reviewing the

    Centre-State relationship and consider the importance of unity and integrity

    of the country for promoting the welfare of the people. One of the facets of

    such review was to discuss the scope of the role of the Governor and its

    impact on the federal polity of India.

99. For a number of years after the independence of India, the political scene

    was dominated by a single party and there was little occasion for strife

    between the central and state governments. The role of the Governor,

    therefore, remained latent. However, post-1967, the emergence of new

    regional political parties led to a discord between the central government

    and those state governments that came to be led by such new regional

    parties. These developments engendered political instability in severalW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                    Page 106 of 414states, as a result of which, the Governors were called upon to exercise their

     discretionary powers more frequently, particularly in recommending

     President’s rule and in reserving State bills for the consideration of the

     President.

100. The role of the Governor in giving assent to State bills, withholding assent

     therefrom or reserving such bills for the consideration of the President, thus,

     assumed importance. By virtue ofArticles 200and201of the Constitution

     respectively, the office of Governor became a major stakeholder for the

     maintenance of a cordial relationship between the central and state

     governments. The Sarkaria Commission was, therefore, tasked with

     providing recommendations regarding the interpretation of the said Articles

     and amendments therein to strengthen the federal polity of India.
101. To the limited extent of studying the issues arising from the exercise of

     powers underArticles 200and201respectively, the Commission addressed

     itself on the following broad points:
102. A discussion of the recommendations of the Commission in this regard

     would be beneficial to our examination ofArticles 200and201respectively

     and the role of the Governor in the contemporary federal polity.



a.    Scope of Governor’s Discretion UnderArticle 200
103. The Commission observed that the rule is that the Governor shall perform

     his functions on the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers of the State

     and the exercise of discretionary powers by him is the exception. The

     Commission envisaged that discretionary powers of reservation of a bill

     underArticle 200should be exercised by the Governor only in rare cases

     where a bill is patently unconstitutional in his opinion. However, the

     Governor should not act contrary to the aid and advice of the Council of

     Ministers merely because he, in his personal capacity, does not favour the

     policy embodied in the bill. The relevant observations of the Commission

     are reproduced below:
104. According to the Commission, the scheme of the Constitution indicates that

    the Governor’s opinion at best, is persuasive. The Governor cannot, in any

    circumstance, exercise dictatorial powers to override or veto the decisions

    or proposals of his Council of Ministers. The scope of discretionary powers

    should be construed in the context of a parliamentary democracy with a

    responsible government. In such a form of government, the role of a formal

    head of the State cannot be enlarged at the cost of the real executive, which

    enjoys the confidence of the people as it is responsible to the State

    legislature.
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 109 of 414
105. Discretion, in exercise of powers underArticle 200, therefore, should be

     dictated by reason, actuated by good faith and tempered by caution.

     Discretionary functions should be performed in public interest and cannot

     be discharged at the dictation of any outside authority unless so authorized

     by and under the Constitution.

106. While addressing suggestions of some State governments that the

     discretionary powers of the Governor must be curtailed or removed as it

     presents a potential threat to the autonomy of the States, the Commission

     observed that the makers of the Constitution advisedly refrained from

     putting such discretionary powers in a straitjacket rigid definition. It noted

     that the Constitution is ever evolving and the ways in which its provisions

     and principles may be tampered with or circumvented, cannot be foreseen.

     Therefore, the office of the Governor should be afforded enough flexibility

     to react in any situation and his discretion to approach a matter cannot be

     pre-determined.
b.    Interplay ofArticles 200And254respectively of the Constitution.
107.Article 246(2)endows the Parliament as well as the State legislatures with

     the competence to legislate on entries under List III i.e., the concurrent list.

     The provision underArticle 254is appurtenant to the concurrent exercise ofW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 110 of 414legislative competence by the Parliament and State legislature insofar as

     there is any inconsistency or repugnancy between the laws of the respective

     legislatures.

108.Article 254(1)saves the power of the State legislatures to make laws with

     respect to matters in the concurrent list from being automatically superseded

     by the operation of the doctrine of repugnancy.Article 254(2)allows a law

     enacted by the State legislature and repugnant to the central law on the same

     subject-matter, to operate and prevail in that State provided that such State

     law receives the assent of the President.

109. The Commission highlighted that clause (2) ofArticle 254is applicable only

     when the following two conditions are cumulatively met:
It is upon satisfaction of both these conditions that the Governor can reserve

     a bill for Presidential consideration underArticle 254(2).W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 111 of 414
110. It was noted by the Commission that the assent by the President to the State

     bills had been withheld on certain occasions on the ground that the Union

     was contemplating a more comprehensive legislation on the same subject

     matter. However, withholding of assent on such a premise at the level of the

     Union may unnecessarily delay or defeat the measures sought to be taken by

     the State legislature. Since the Parliament retains the power to amend, vary

     or repeal such a State legislation, even after its enactment, by passing a

     subsequent law inconsistent therewith, the Commission recommended that

     Presidential assent should not ordinarily be withheld on the ground that the

     Union is contemplating a comprehensive law in future on the same subject-

     matter.
c.    Scope of Union Executive’s Discretion underArticle 201
111. As per the report of the Commission, a State bill, once reserved for the

     consideration of the President (upon the aid and advice of the Council of

     Ministers), is made subject to the procedure prescribed underArticle 201and the Union Executive is entitled to examine it from all angles such as,

     inter alia, conformity to legislative or executive policy of the Union,

     harmony with the scheme and provisions of the Constitution, vires of the

     bill, etc.W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                    Page 112 of 414
112. On the question of the Union Executive’s discretion to withhold assent to a

     State bill on the ground of non-conformity with its policy, the Commission

     sounded a note of caution saying that policy considerations should not

     ordinarily be treated as a valid ground for withholding Presidential assent.Article 201confers supervisory powers on the Union Executive to enable it

     to secure a broad uniformity across central and state legislations in the

     interests of the social and economic unity of the country. However, the said

     provision cannot act as a measure for the Union Executive to bring to a

     grinding halt a State bill by withholding assent thereto if such a bill does not

     conform to its policy in general.

113. Further, the Union Executive is required to exercise utmost caution,

     circumspection and restraint in the exercise of supervisory powers underArticle 201, especially in respect of the bills on subject matters that fall

     within the State List. In this regard, the Commission recommended that as a

     matter of convention, the President should not withhold assent only on

     consideration of policy differences on matters relating, in pith and substance,

     to the State List, except on the grounds of patent unconstitutionality.
114. The Commission did not make any specific prescription in respect ofArticle

     143of the Constitution, which enables the President and by extension, the

     Union Council of Ministers to seek the opinion of the Supreme Court inW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 113 of 414respect of bills which may be deemed to be unconstitutional and left the

     decision up to the President to make such a reference in appropriate cases.



d.    Impropriety of Conditional Assent by the President
115. The Commission noted that the scheme of the Constitution providing for

     reservation of State legislations for the consideration and assent of the

     President, is intended to subserve the broad purpose of cooperative

     federalism in the realm of Union-State legislative relations. Therefore, the

     practice of according assent to a State bill by the President on the reciprocal

     assurance that the changes suggested by him (or the Union Executive) will

     be carried out by way of an ordinance, was not considered to be ideal

     especially when there exists a constitutional remedy under the proviso toArticle 201itself.

116. Since, conditional assent may become a tool for the Centre to dictate its

     policies to the States by attaching conditions to Presidential assent, the

     Commission, in cognizance of the impropriety of such a practice,

     recommended that in cases where the Union Government is of the opinion

     that some amendments to a State bill are essential before it becomes a law,

     such bill should be returned through the Governor to the State legislature for

     reconsideration in terms of the proviso to Article 201.W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 114 of 414e.    Essentials for a “Reference” of State Bills to the President for his
      Consideration
117. The Commission, cognizant of the misgivings and irritations in Union-State

     relations due to delays in the process of securing Presidential assent,

     recommended that the procedure of making a reference to the President by

     the State Government through the Governor and the consideration thereof

     by the Union Government must be streamlined. It was also endorsed that the

     Governments at both the Centre and State level may benefit from a prior

     consultation at the stage of drafting of the bill itself and prescribing time-

     limits for disposal, which ought to be made convention and practice.
118. As regards the suggestion of streamlining the procedures involved in

     reserving a State bill for consideration of the President, the Commission

     recommended that every reference from the State should be complete and

     clearly established. Such reference should set out precise material facts,

     points for consideration and the reason for making a reference to the

     President. Accordingly, the Commission recommended the following

     information to be necessarily provided for ensuring that the reference to the

     President is self-contained:
119. The question whether there was a requirement of introducing time-limits inArticle 201was necessary or not was also looked into by the Commission.

     It was reiterated that streamlining the procedure of reserving a State bill for

     Presidential consideration and enabling a mechanism for high-level

     discussions between the Union and State at the stage of drafting such bill

     may effectively reduce procedural delays at the level of the Union

     Government. Nevertheless, it was recommended that the Union and StateW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 116 of 414Governments should adopt definite timelines for processing State bills and

    disposing of their references to the President.

120. With regard to prescription of such timelines, the Commission proposed the

    following timelines to be treated as salutary conventions:
Article 200 (in exercise of his discretion   bill is presented to the

           in exceptional circumstances).Governor.
121. With a view to ensure that the timelines so suggested are not frustrated by

     lack of clarity and comprehensiveness in a reference, the Commission

     underscored the importance of a self-contained communication by the

     President to the State legislature for clarification or reconsideration of the

     bill. It was emphasized that clarifications to be sought by way of the proviso

     toArticle 201should not be piecemeal.

122. While the Commission noted the significance of clear timelines for the

     exercise of powers underArticles 200and201respectively, it did not

     recommend any amendments to the said Articles for introducing concrete

     time periods within the constitutional scheme and left its recommendations

     in this regard at the stage of conventions only.
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 118 of 414
g.    Withholding of Assent by the President
123. As regards the withholding of Presidential assent, the Commission laid great

     emphasis that the Union Government ought to communicate to the State

     government, the reasons therefor. It was noted that the Union Government

     should enter into the practice of discussing the issues present in the bill with

     the State Government and making an effort to present its point of view to

     the State Government with reasons.

h.    Recommendations given by the Commission
124. Before concluding the discussion on the aspect of reservation of bills by the

     Governor for consideration of the President, the Commission noted that

     needless reservation of bills should be avoided. The constitutional scheme

     does not envisage indiscriminate reservation of bills, especially when it is

     being done in his discretion, as the same would be subversive of the federal

     principle and the supremacy of the State legislature.
125. The Commission classified State bills to be reserved for the consideration of

     the President as follows:
ii. Bills which may be reserved for President's
                consideration and assent for specific purposes
(i)    To secure immunity from operation ofArticles 14and
19. These are Bills for—
(a) acquisition of estates, etc. [First Proviso toArticle
                       31A(I)];
(b) giving effect to Directive Principles of State Policy
                       (Proviso toArticle 31C).
(ii) A Bill relating to a subject enumerated in the
                   Concurrent List, to ensure operation of its provisions
                   despite their repugnancy to a Union law or an existing
                   law, by securing President's assent in terms ofArticle
                   254(2).
(iii) Legislation imposing restrictions on trade and
                   commerce requiring Presidential sanction under the
                   Proviso toArticle 304(b)read withArticle 255.
iii. Bills which may not specifically fall under any of the
                   above categories, yet may be reserved by the
                   Governor for President's consideration under Article
200.”
                                           (Emphasis supplied)
126. The Commission recommended that bills should be reserved only if required

    for specific purposes falling in the first two classes as extracted hereinabove.W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 120 of 414
iv.    Punchhi Commission
127. Another Commission on Centre-State relations was constituted by the

      Government of India in 2007 under the chairmanship of Justice Madan

      Mohan Punchhi, the former Chief Justice of India. The Commission was

      tasked with the mandate of reviewing the existing arrangements between the

      Union and States as per the Constitution of India in regard to powers,

      functions and responsibilities in all spheres including legislative relations,

      administrative relations, role of Governors, emergency provisions, etc. and

      recommending such changes as may be appropriate keeping in view

      practical difficulties, growing challenges of ensuring good governance and

      the need for strengthening the unity and integrity of the country.
128. The Commission, inter alia, looked at the original scheme of the Centre-
State relations as laid down by the Constitution, examined the friction points

      in the working thereof and reviewed the adequacy of the constitutional

      arrangements for promoting social welfare and good governance. One aspect

      of this study involved looking minutely into the role of the Governor in the

      federal polity of India. The Commission noted that the role of the Governor

      became important as he had to balance the political considerations between

      the Centre and State and be as impartial as possible.
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 121 of 414
129. However, as regional political powers grew at the State level, the role of the

     Governor came to be a point of contention between the Centre and States

     with the latter leveling allegations of partiality and lack of objectivity in

     exercise of the Governor’s discretionary powers. As a result, the

     Commission was enjoined with the task of providing recommendations for

     better working of the office of the Governor.

a.    Role of the Governor
130. The Commission observed that the nature and scope of rights and powers of

     the Governor should be understood in the context of a Cabinet system of

     government. Under such system, the Governor performs a multi-faceted

     role. First, as constitutional head of the State, he has a right to be consulted,

     to warn and encourage. In performance of this role, the Constitution makers

     ideated the office of Governor to perform the role of a “a friend, philosopher

     and guide” to his Council of Ministers. Secondly, the Governor functions as

     a sentinel of the Constitution and acts as the Union’s representative in the

     State. As observed by this Court inRameshwar Prasad & Ors. v. Union of

     Indiareported in (2006) 2 SCC 1, the Governor discharges “dual

     responsibility” to the Union and State.
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 122 of 414
131. Further, the Constitution affords the Governor only a persuasive role and not

     dictatorial powers to override or veto the decisions or proposals of his

     Council of Ministers. The Commission observed that the Governor, at best,

     has powers of giving advice or counselling for further reflection of the

     decision taken by the Council of Ministers. The Governor only flags a need

     for caution for the purpose of bridging the understanding between the

     Government and opposition (if there are different governments at the central

     and state level).

132. The Governor is not amenable to the directions of the Union government,

     nor does the Constitution make him accountable to the Centre for the manner

     in which he carries out his functions and duties. The office of Governor is

     an independent constitutional office. The Governor, by virtue ofArticle 163,

     however, is bound by the aid and advice of the State Council of Ministers.

     Therefore, in the event of a conflict between the aid and advice of the State

     Council of Ministers and the dictates of the Central Government, the scheme

     of the Constitution indicates that the Governor must adhere to the former.
133. With the broad tenets of the role of the Governor under the constitutional

     scheme, the Commission, while appraising the existing framework of

     Centre-State relations, observed that a major point of friction between theW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                     Page 123 of 414Centre and States is the power of the Governor to reserve any State bill for

     the consideration of the President, sometimes even for an indefinite period.
b.    Discretionary Powers of the Governor
134. Upon a perusal ofArticle 163(2), the Commission was of the view that the

     said provision gives the impression that the Governor has a wide and

     undefined area of discretionary powers. However, the scope of the

     discretionary powers of the Governor has to be narrowly construed. The

     language ofArticle 163(2)cannot be taken to mean that the Governor has a

     general discretionary power to act against the aid and advice of the Council

     of Ministers.

135. In continuation to the Sarkaria Commission’s views on the question of

     discretionary powers of the Governor, the Punchhi Commission report also

     asserts that the area for the exercise of discretion is limited and even in this

     limited area, the Governor’s choice of action should neither be nor appear to

     be arbitrary or fanciful. It must be a choice dictated by reason, actuated by

     good faith and tempered with caution.

136. The Commission further emphasized the necessity of prescribing time limits

     for the exercise of powers underArticles 200and201respectively in orderW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 124 of 414to ensure that discretionary powers are not exercised by the Governor or the

     President in a manner that undermines the State legislature and the will of

     the people.
c.    Expediency in Disposal of Bills – Timelines Suggested by the
      Report of the Commission
137. The Commission suggested that definite timelines ought to be adopted as

     salutary conventions for the Governor to either provide assent or reserve the

     bill for the consideration of the President. Similarly, there should be a time

     limit for the President to take a decision on the State bill underArticle 201of the Constitution. The Commission was of the view that concrete timelines

     are sine qua non for the exercise of powers underArticles 200and201respectively so as to avoid dissensions between the Central and State

     governments.

138. The Commission noted that the substantive part ofArticle 200does not

     stipulate time period within which the Governor has to either assent,

     withhold assent or reserve the bill for Presidential consideration. The

     requirement of expediency is incumbent upon the Governor only when he

     decides to return the bill to the State legislature for reconsideration. The

     same was considered to be evident from the expression “as soon as

     possible”.
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 125 of 414
139. The Commission noted that while the expression “as soon as possible” is

    mentioned inArticle 200albeit only in the first proviso thereof, there is no

    such compulsion on the President underArticle 201.As a result, the

    President or the Union Government may kill the bill by not taking a decision

    on the same, sometimes for the entire duration of the State legislature. This

    increases the scope for abuse of discretion by the Union government based

    on political considerations particularly when the ruling party in the State

    concerned is different from the one enjoying power at the Union level. The

    lack of a reasonable timeline allows the executive fiat to make inroads into

    the legislative power of the State thereby thwarting the democratic will of

    the State legislature. Such invasion of the powers of the State legislature by

    the Union Executive is questionable in the context of ‘basic features’ of the

    Constitution.

140. Therefore, the Commission suggested that a period of six months should be

    prescribed inArticle 201for the President to decide on assenting or

    withholding assent to a bill reserved for consideration of the President. In

    case the President on the aid and advice of the Union Council of Ministers,

    is unable to give assent to a State bill underArticle 201, it is desirable for

    him to make a reference to the Supreme Court underArticle 143for an

    opinion. Such reference should be done as a matter of practice in order toW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 126 of 414avoid allegations of political bias, while securing the dignity and authority

     of the State legislature.
d.    Recommendations
141. Having considered the challenges in the exercise of powers underArticles

     200and201respectively, the Commission reiterated the recommendations

     of the National Commission to Review the Working of the Constitution

     (“NCRWC”), which are reproduced hereinbelow:
within which the Governor should take a decision whether to
             grant assent or to reserve it for the consideration of the
             President;
(b) Delete the words ""or that he withholds assent therefrom"".
             In other words, the power to withhold assent, conferred upon
             the Governor, byArticle 200should be done away with;
(c) If the Bill is reserved for the consideration of the
             President, there should be a time-limit, say of three months,
             within which the President should take a decision whether to
             accord his assent or to direct the Governor to return it to the
             State Legislature or to seek the opinion of the Supreme Court
             regarding the constitutionality of the Act underArticle 143
             (as it happened in the case of Kerala Education Bill in 1958);
(d) When the State Legislature reconsiders and passes the
             Bill (with or without amendments) after it is returned by theW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 127 of 414Governor pursuant to the direction of the President, the
             President should be bound to grant his assent;
(e) To provide that a ""Money Bill"" cannot be reserved by the
             Governor for the consideration of the President;
(f) In the alternative it may be more advisable to delete
             altogether the words inArticle 200empowering the
             Governor to reserve a Bill for the consideration of the
             President except in the case contemplated by the second
             proviso toArticle 200and in cases where the Constitution
             requires him to do so. Such a course would not only
             strengthen the federal principle but would also do away with
             the anomalous situation, whereunder a Bill passed by the
             State Legislature can be 'killed' by the Union Council of
             Ministers by advising the President to withhold his assent
             thereto or just by cold-storaging it.”

     implementation of the above-mentioned recommendations by way of a

     Constitutional Amendment.
F.    INTERNATIONAL JURISPRUDENCE ON ASSENT TO BILLS
143. The tenets of parliamentary democracy demand that while the head of state

     must act on the advice of ministers, the ministers, in turn, must uphold their

     responsibility to the people when providing that advice. Indeed, the very

     raison d’être of a democratic government is to uphold the primacy of the

     Parliament by ensuring executive accountability. This has been aptly putW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 128 of 414forth by Nicholas Barber, Professor of Constitutional Law and Theory at the

      Oxford University, in his work ‘Can Royal Assent Be Refused on the Advice

      of the Prime Minister?’7 wherein he argues:
144. The position in the United Kingdom is that once a bill has passed through

      all parliamentary stages in both Houses, it is poised for the conferment of

      ‘royal assent’. Historically, the Sovereign granted assent to bills in person

      in the House of Lords, attended by the Lords Commissioners. This formal

      ceremony was known as the ‘Royal Assent ceremony’. The Royal Assent

      ceremony continued until 1967, when the British Parliament passed the

      Royal Assent Act wherein the requirement of grant of assent in person by the

      monarch was made voluntary. Although granting assent is a personal7Nicholas Barber, Can Royal Assent Be Refused on the Advice of the Prime Minister?, UK

W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                                   Page 129 of 414prerogative of the monarch, yet it has long been an established convention

       that the monarch does not withhold it for a bill that has received approval

       from both Houses. The process of Royal Assent comprises two stages: first,

       the signification of the royal assent to a bill via the Royal Sign Manual on

       Letters Patent issued under the Great Seal of the Realm; and secondly, the

       communication of the King’s Assent to both Houses of Parliament. In the

       United Kingdom (UK), royal assent is regarded as a formality and has not

       been refused to a bill since Queen Anne’s reign in 1707.
145. In Parliament of the UK, the procedure for obtaining Royal Assent begins

       with officials in the Public Bill Office of the House of Lords that manages

       and assists the processes relating to the House’s consideration of public

       legislation. First, a list of bills is prepared by the Clerk of the Parliaments.

       Thereafter, once a date for Royal Assent has been set, all the bills approved

       by both Houses are presented before the monarch for assent. In this regard,

       the monarch has no power to withhold assent to a bill, regardless of any

       instructions from the Government or anyone else.8 In Scotland, a period of

       four weeks is allowed before a bill is presented to the Queen for assent,

       during which any legal objections may be raised.

146. The only ground on which assent may be withheld, that too solely on

     ministerial advice, is if the bill has failed to comply with mandatory

     procedural requirements or if there has been a change in government

     between the bill’s approval and its presentation for assent. Section 4 of the

     Judicial Committee Act, 1833 provides that the Sovereign may refer a bill to

     the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council for an advisory opinion on

     whether such bill contravenes a fundamental constitutional principle.

     However, the position in the UK does not clarify whether the Sovereign can

     initiate such a referral independently.

b.    Canada
147. Canada’s Royal Assent ceremony traces its origins to the United Kingdom.
Traditionally, once a bill was passed in identical form by both the Senate

     and the House of Commons, the Governor General, as the Crown’s

     representative, attended the Parliament to provide Royal Assent to such bill.

     In absence of the Governor General, a Justice of the Supreme Court of

     Canada acting as Deputy to the Governor General is presented the bills for

     Royal Assent. The Governor General signs a Declaration of Royal Assent,

     witnessed by the Clerk of the Parliaments.

148. Section 3 of the Royal Assent Act, 2002 (Can) provides that assent may be

     given ‘in Parliament assembled’ or through a written declaration, providedW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                     Page 131 of 414it is witnessed by more than one member from each House.The Actstipulates that the Royal Assent must be given in the Senate Chamber at least

    twice a year and for the first appropriation bill of each session of the

    Parliament. In all other cases, such assent may be granted by the Governor

    General or her Deputy by written consent. At the provincial level, assent is

    given by the Lieutenant Governor, who is appointed by the Governor

    General. As per Section 57 of the Constitution Act, 1867, when bills are

    reserved for Queen’s pleasure, she acts upon ministerial advice rather than

    the advice of the Houses.

149. The Supreme Court of Canada in Reference Re Amendment of the

    Constitution of Canada, reported in 1981 SCC OnLine Can SC 77,

    recognized that, by convention, neither the Queen nor the vice-regal

    representative (equivalent of a Governor in India) may, on their own, refuse

    assent to a bill passed by both Houses of the Parliament on the grounds of

    opposition to or disapproval of its policy. The relevant portion of the

    judgment in reference reads thus:
150. In Galati v. Governor-General of Canada, reported in [2015] FC 91, the

    Federal Court of Canada was faced with the question of whether the grant

    of royal assent by the Governor General to the Strengthening Canadian

    Citizenship Act, 2014 could be set aside by the court on the ground that

    enactment of the same was outside the legislative competence of the

    Parliament. It was contended by the applicants that the Governor General

    exceeded the scope of his discretion as well as his authority under the Royal

    Assent Act of Canada by assenting to the said bill. The Federal Court,

    however, dismissed the application and held that the Governor General’s act

    of affixing royal assent to the bill was a legislative act. Therefore, the issueW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 133 of 414of whether the Governor General exceeded his constitutional authority in

     granting royal assent to the said bill was not justiciable. The relevant portion

     of the judgment is reproduced below for ready reference:
151. The views of the Federal Court in Galati (supra) that the grant of royal

     assent by the Governor-General was a legislative act and hence, non-

     justiciable was in line with the view of the Court in Gallant v. The King,

     [1949] 2 DLR 425 wherein it was noted that the Lieutenant-Governor is a

     part of the legislature and the act of providing royal assent is also a

     legislative action.

c.    United States of AmericaW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 134 of 414
152. The Constitution of the United States, more particularly, Article I,Section

     7, Clause 2 thereof states that once a bill has been passed by the House of

     Representatives and the Senate, it must be presented to the President. If the

     President approves, he may sign the bill; otherwise, he may return it with his

     objections for reconsideration. If, after reconsideration, two-thirds of both

     the Houses passes the bill, it becomes law. Further, if the President does not

     sign a bill within ten days of presenting the same, while Congress is in

     session, the bill automatically becomes law. Therefore, in this limited

     circumstance, the concept of pocket veto is not available to the President.

     However, if Congress adjourns while the bill is awaiting assent and the

     President does not sign the bill within ten days, the bill does not become law.
d.    New Zealand
153. The colonial legislative framework of New Zealand under theConstitution

     Act, 1852, vested structured discretion in provincial authorities while

     maintaining the supremacy of the Crown.Section 27of the Constitution Act,

     1852 stipulated that every bill passed by the Provincial Council must be

     presented to the Superintendent who was an elected head of each Provincial

     Council, for the assent of the Governor who was the representative of the

     monarch. The Superintendent, in his discretion, could have either granted

     assent on behalf of the Governor or withheld assent or reserved the bill for

     the Governor’s pleasure. For a bill to become law, Superintendent had toW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 135 of 414signify Governor’s assent. Further, her Majesty, with the advice of her Privy

     Council could issue instructions to the Governor to guide him in exercise of

     his powers to assent to, dissent from, or reserve bills for her Majesty’s

     pleasure. The Governor was required to act in obedience to these

     instructions.

154. By the introduction of the Constitution Act, 1986, the Sovereign began to

     act on the advice of the Executive Council which is the part of the executive

     branch of government. It states that a bill passed by the House of

     Representatives becomes law when the Sovereign or the Governor-General

     grants assent.Section 3of the Act states that the power conferred on the

     Governor-General are royal powers exercised on behalf of the Sovereign.

     These powers may be exercised either by the Sovereign in person or by the

     Governor-General. Additionally, any reference in an Act to the Governor-

     General in Council also includes the Sovereign acting with the advice and

     consent of the Executive Council. The Prime Minister-designate is

     appointed as the Executive Councillor and he advises the Governor-General

     to appoint other Councillors. Section 3A removes any discretion of the

     Sovereign or the Governor-General, stating that they may exercise a power

     on the advice and with the consent of the Executive Council.
e.    AustraliaW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 136 of 414
155. The structure of governance in Australia reflects a nuanced distribution of

        the Queen’s powers through her representatives at both national and state

        levels. The Queen of Australia is the formal Head of State. At the national

        level, the Queen’s powers and functions qua the Government of Australia

        are exercised by the Governor-General of Australia. At the State level, her

        powers are exercised by the Governor of the State. As per Section 2(1) of

        the Constitution Act, 1889, the legislative powers were vested in the

        Sovereign and exercised by her colonial Governors, subject to the advice of

        legislators. At the national level, Governor-General is not given ministerial

        advice on assent, the Presiding Officer of the House requests for assent and

        the Attorney General provides a certificate to the Governor-General

        regarding whether the bill needs to be reserved for the Queen’s assent or

        regarding any corrections.9
156. It is said that the role of the Governor-General is to ensure due process – that

        the bill was passed in Houses following the procedure. He is not concerned

        with the contents of the legislation as the act of the Governor-General is

        executive. However, in the context of Governor (state level), the Court of

        Appeal in Eastgate v. Rozzoli, reported in (1990) 20 NSWLR 188, noted

        that while giving assent the Australian State Governor acts as a constituent

        part of the Parliament. If a bill is reserved for Queen’s pleasure, she acts9DEPT. OF PRIME MINISTER & CABINET, AUSTL. GOVT., LEGISLATION HANDBOOK (2017).W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                          Page 137 of 414upon the advice of Australian Commonwealth Ministers. The power to refer

     bills back to Parliament can be exercised only upon ministerial advice. At

     the states, the parliamentary officers seek State Governor’s assent.

     Ordinarily, the State Governors assent to bills without any ministerial

     advice, only South Australia endeavors to provide executive advice to the

     Governor.

f.    Ireland
157. Ireland’s constitutional order provides a unique provision enabling the

     President to refer bills to the Supreme Court for its view on the

     constitutionality of the bills.Article 26of the Constitution of the Ireland

     confers a power on the President, who, after consultation with the Council

     of State, may refer any bill to the Supreme Court for a decision on whether

     any provisions of the bill are repugnant to the Constitution. Such reference

     must be within seven days from the presentation of the bill to the President.

     If the Supreme Court holds that any provision of the bill is repugnant to the

     Constitution, the President declines to sign such bill.
g.    Republic of Singapore
158. The Constitution of Singapore establishes a structured framework for the

     exercise of presidential discretion, setting clear time limits for decision-

     making while also ensuring safeguards against legislative overreach.ArticleW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                     Page 138 of 41421Aof the Constitution stipulates the general time limit for the President to

     exercise his discretionary powers. It provides that when the Constitution

     grants the President discretion in granting or refusing assent, concurrence,

     approval, or confirmation, he must signify his decision within the specified

     period after it is sought. The time period specified for granting assent ranges

     from thirty days to six weeks. However, it may be extended contingent upon

     any agreement between the President and the Cabinet.
159. Article 22H applies in cases where the bill or any provision seeks to curtail

     discretionary powers of the President. If, within thirty days, the President

     neither withholds assent nor refers the bill to the tribunal for its opinion on

     whether the bill curtails the President’s discretionary powers, then the

     President is deemed to have assented. Even when the tribunal is of the

     opinion that the bill does not curtail the discretionary powers conferred on

     the President, the President is still deemed to have assented.
h.    Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka
160. The Constitution of Sri Lanka, more particularly, Article 154H, stipulates

     that upon the presentation of a statute enacted by the Provincial Council, the

     Governor shall either assent to it or return it for reconsideration as soon as

     possible. The Provincial Council may then pass the statute with or without

     amendments. If the statute is presented to the Governor again, he mayW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 139 of 414reserve it for reference by the President to the Supreme Court within one

     month of its second time, seeking a determination as to whether is

     inconsistent with the Constitution. If the Supreme Court holds the statute to

     be consistent, the Governor must grant assent. If it is held inconsistent, the

     Governor may withhold assent. It can be concluded that, upon the first

     presentation of a bill, the Governor has only two options: granting assent or

     returning it for reconsideration. On the second presentation, the Governor

     may only reserve the bill, referring it to the President for submission to the

     Supreme Court. He does not have the discretion to withhold assent

     independently.

i.    Republic of Kiribati
161. The constitutional framework of Kiribati is similar to the Democratic

     Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka. It provides powers to withhold assent only

     in exceptional situations. Section 66 of the Constitution of Kiribati allows

     the Beretitenti, that is the head of the state and head of the government, to

     withhold assent to a bill only if he believes the bill to be inconsistent with

     the Constitution. In such a case, the bill is returned to the Parliament for

     amendment, and if it is presented again and the Beretitenti still believes that

     the bill is inconsistent with the Constitution, he is required to refer it to the

     High Court for a declaration. If the Court declares that the bill is notW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 140 of 414consistent with the Constitution, the Beretitenti must grant assent forthwith.
If the Court declares the bill to be inconsistent, it is sent back to Parliament.

     The Constitution of Zimbabwe under Section 131 provides a time period of

     twenty-one days to either assent to the bill or refer it for reconsideration.
j.    Republic of Fiji
162. The Constitution of Fiji, 2013 also does not vest discretionary power in the

     President. While Section 53 of the Fiji Independence Order, 1970 and

     Constitution of Fiji granted the Governor-General the power to grant assent

     or withhold assent, the Constitution of Fiji, 2013, removed any discretion on

     the part of the President. Section 48 of the Constitution stipulates that once

     a bill is passed, the Speaker must present it to the President for assent, which

     must be granted within seven days; otherwise, the bill is deemed to have

     received assent.

k.    Solomon Islands & Antigua and Barbuda
163. Both the Solomon Islands and Antigua and Barbuda have constitutional

     provisions that mandate the Governor-General to grant assent to bills passed

     by Parliament. In the Solomon Islands, Section 59(2) of the Constitution of

     the Soloman Islands provides that when a bill has been passed by the

     Parliament it shall be presented to the Governor-General who shall assent toW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 141 of 414it forthwith on behalf of the Head of the State. Whereas Section 52(2) of the

     Constitution of Antigua and Barbuda states that when a bill is presented to

     the Governor-General for assent in accordance with this Constitution, he

     shall signify that he assents thereto.

l.    Islamic Republic of Pakistan
164. In our neighboring country,Article 75of the Constitution of the Islamic

     Republic of Pakistan provides that when a bill is presented to the President,

     he must either assent within ten days or return it to Parliament with a request

     for reconsideration. If the bill is passed again by a majority, whether

     amended or not, the President must grant assent within ten days, failing

     which it will be deemed to have received assent. WhereasArticle 105stipulates that the Governor shall act in accordance with the advice of the

     Cabinet or the Chief Minister. The Governor may, however, require the

     Cabinet or the Chief Minister to reconsider the advice. Following such

     reconsideration, the Governor must act in accordance with the advice

     tendered within ten days.

m.    Federal Republic of Germany
165. The legislative process in Germany is governed by both federal and state

     constitutional provisions.Article 76of the Basic Law for the Federal

     Republic of Germany states that bills are to be introduced in BundestagW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 142 of 414(house elected by the people) by the Federal Government or by the

     Bundesrat (federal council). The provision grants the Bundesrat a period of

     six weeks to comment on bills for Federal Government bills. The Federal

     Government submits the bills, alongwith its views, to the Bundestag within

     six weeks alongwith its views.Article 78provides that a bill adopted by the

     Bundestag become the law if the Bundesrat consents to it. Laws enacted in

     accordance with the provisions of the Basic Law, after being countersigned,

     are certified by the Federal President. Furthermore, Section 60, Section V,

     the Constitution of Berlin stipulates that the bills shall be signed by the

     President of the House of Representatives without delay and then

     promulgated by the Governing Mayor within two weeks.
n.    Italian Republic
166. The legislative process in Italy is shaped by constitutional provisions that

     define the President’s role in the promulgation of laws and the scope of

     legislative urgency.Article 73of the Constitution of the Italian Republic

     mandates that laws be promulgated by the President within one month of

     their approval. However, if the Chambers (the Parliament consists of the

     Chamber of Deputies and the Senate of the Republic), by a majority vote,

     declare a bill to be urgent, it shall be promulgated within the time specified

     by the bill itself.Article 74empowers the President to request a new

     deliberation by means of a message stating the reasons for such a request. ItW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 143 of 414is important to take note that if the Chambers pass the bill once again, then

     the law must to be promulgated.

o.    French Republic
167. In France, the promulgation of legislation is subject to defined constitutional

     timelines.Article 10of the Constitution of October 4, 1958, stipulates that

     the President of the Republic must promulgate Acts of Parliament within

     fifteen days after the final passage of an Act. It also empowers the President

     to request Parliament to reopen the debate on the Act, or any specific

     sections thereof, and such a request for reopening of debate shall not be

     refused.

p.    Japan
168. As per the Japanese constitutional framework, the Diet (Parliament of Japan)

     is the sole law-making organ of the State.Article 59envisages that if a bill

     passed by the House of Representatives is rejected by the House of

     Councillors, it becomes a law when passed a second time by the House of

     Representatives by a two-thirds majority of the members present.Article 74states that all laws and cabinet orders must be signed by the competent

     Minister of State and countersigned by the Prime Minister.W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 144 of 414
169. A plain reading ofArticle 200of the Constitution indicates that when a bill

     is passed by the legislature of a State, it is mandatorily required to be placed

     before the Governor for his assent. This is because without receiving the

     assent of the President, a bill cannot become an Act. However, when a bill

     is presented to the Governor for his assent, the Governor is required to make

     a declaration from the three options available to him under the substantive

     part ofArticle 200, that is, to assent, to withhold assent, or to reserve the bill

     for the consideration of the President.

170. The first proviso prescribes a mechanism whereby the Governor may return

     a bill, which is not a Money Bill, back to the State legislature requesting

     them to reconsider the bill or certain provisions thereof or consider the

     possibility of making certain amendments to it. Once a bill is so returned by

     the Governor, the State legislature is required to take note of the suggestions

     made by the Governor and reconsider the bill accordingly. If the bill, after

     such reconsideration by the State Legislature is again passed and presented

     to the Governor, then in such circumstances as per the first proviso, the

     Governor would then be prohibited from withholding his assent to the bill.W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                          Page 145 of 414
171. The second proviso provides for a specific situation wherein the Governor

    is mandated to reserve a bill for the consideration of the President if, in his

    opinion, the bill upon becoming law, would so derogate from the powers of

    the High Court as to endanger the position which the High Court has been

    designed to fill by the Constitution.

172. One of the principal contentions advanced by the learned Attorney General

    before us was that the first proviso toArticle 200provides an independent

    fourth course of action to the Governor besides the three other options

    available to him under the substantive part of the Article. To put it

    differently, his argument was that the Governor may either withhold assent

    to a bill simpliciter, as provided under the substantive part ofArticle 200, or

    he may invoke the procedure prescribed under the first proviso and return

    the bill back to the State legislature along with such a message as is

    mentioned in the first proviso. In other words, he contended that where the

    Governor declares a simpliciter withholding of assent, the same would be an

    absolute veto of the bill, and the State legislature would have no occasion to

    reconsider the bill in such a scenario. As a corollary the first proviso would

    have no applicability and the State legislature would not be entitled to

    reconsider the bill on its own motion.
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 146 of 414
173. He argued that in cases where the bill suffers from some gross and manifest

     unconstitutionality, the Governor need not invoke the procedure mentioned

     in the first proviso and it would be sufficient if he declares a simpliciter

     withholding of the bill. As a corollary, he submitted that the procedure

     prescribed under the first proviso may be followed by the Governor when

     he is of the belief that the bill, which is otherwise constitutional, may benefit

     from certain amendments and in such a case he may send a message to the

     State legislature suggesting certain amendments to the bill.
174. In other words, his contention was that simpliciter withholding is to be opted

     for by the Governor in his position as a custodian of the Constitution in the

     State, while the procedure prescribed in the first proviso is to be followed

     by him in his role as a friend, philosopher and guide of the State

     Government, with a view to improve an otherwise constitutionally

     innocuous piece of legislation.

175. The aforesaid contention of the Attorney General was met by the petitioner

     by placing reliance on the recent decision of this Court inState of Punjab(supra) wherein it was held that the option of withholding of assent under

     the substantive part ofArticle 200is attached with the first proviso. The

     petitioner contended that in light of the said observation, it is not open forW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 147 of 414the Governor to undertake any simpliciter withholding of a bill presented to

    him and he must mandatorily resort to the procedure indicated in the first

    proviso if he decides to withhold assent to a bill.

176. The Attorney General, on the other hand, raised doubts as regards the

    correctness of the decision inState of Punjab(supra) and argued thatthe

    said decisionwas rendered without having regard to the earlier decisions

    given by larger Benches of this Court.In particular, he placed reliance on

    certain observations made by the Constitution Bench inValluri Basavaiah

    Chowdhary(supra) to support his contention.

177.In response, the petitioner argued in favour of the decision inState of

    Punjab(supra) and submitted that the observations made inValluri

    Basavaiah Chowdhary(supra) were made in a case where this Court was

    not dealing with the interpretation ofArticle 200of the Constitution. Thus,

    the observations made therein as regardsArticle 200could be said to be

    obiter dicta at best. Mr. Dwivedi went to the extent of submitting that the

    observations of this Court being relied upon by the Attorney General cannot

    be construed as obiter dicta as they were mere passing remarks irrelevant to

    the lis before the Courtin that case.
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                     Page 148 of 414
178. It is in this backdrop that we are called upon to ascertain whether the

    observations made inValluri Basavaiah Chowdhary(supra) can be

    reconciled with the decision of this Court inState of Punjab(supra). The

    consequence of this inquiry would be that it would determine whether the

    constitutional scheme ofArticle 200envisages a simpliciter withholding of

    assent by the Governor.In other words, if the decision inState of Punjab(supra) is found to be per incuriam, it would mean that the Governor underArticle 200has the power of exercising an absolute veto upon any bill which

    is presented to him for assent.

179. Before going into the question of whether the observations made inValluri

    Basavaiah Chowdhary(supra) could be said to be the ratio, obiter or

    irrelevant to the lis, we deem it necessary to reproduce the observations

    relied upon by the Attorney General in support of his submission:
180. The crux of the controversy as regards whether the first proviso provides an

     independent course of action to the Governor lies in the use of the expression

     “in which case the Bill falls through unless the procedure indicated in the

     first proviso is followed”. However, what is interesting to note is that this

     expression did not come to be used for the first time inValluri Basavaiah

     Chowdhary(supra).Much prior tothe said decision, Justice S.R. Das (as

     his lordship then was), in a concurring opinion inState of Bihar v.

     Maharajadhiraja Sir Kameshwar Singh of Darbhangareported in (1952)

     1 SCC 528 observed as follows:
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 150 of 414
21. The second proviso impacts upon the option which is
        provided by the substantive part ofArticle 200to the
        Governor to reserve a Bill for the consideration of the
        President by making it mandatory in the situation envisaged
        there. The option of reserving a Bill for the consideration of
        the President is turned into a mandate where the Governor
        has no option but to reserve it for the consideration of the
        President. The second proviso is, therefore, in the nature of
        an exception to the option which is granted to the Governor
        by the substantive part ofArticle 200to reserve any Bill for
        the consideration of the President.
22. A proviso, as is well settled, may fulfil the purpose of
        being an exception. Sometimes, however, a proviso may be in
        the form of an explanation or in addition to the substantive
        provision of a statute. The first proviso allows the Governor,
        where the Bill is not a Money Bill to send it back to the
        legislature together with a message. In terms of the message,
        the legislature may be requested by the Governor to
        reconsider the entirety of the Bill. This may happen for
        instance where the Governor believes that the entirety of the
        Bill suffers from an infirmity. Alternatively, the Governor
        may request the legislature to reconsider any specific
        provision of the Bill. While returning the Bill, the Governor
        may express the desirability of introducing an amendment in
        the Bill. The desirability of an amendment may arise with a
        view to cure an infirmity or deficiency in the Bill. The
        concluding part of the first proviso however stipulates that if
        the Bill is passed again by the legislature either with or
        without amendments, the Governor shall not withhold assent
        therefrom upon presentation. The concluding phrase “shall
        not withhold assent therefrom” is a clear indicator that the
        exercise of the power under the first proviso is relatable to
        the withholding of the assent by the Governor to the Bill in
        the first instance. That is why in the concluding part, the first
        proviso indicates that upon the passing of the Bill by the
        legislature either with or without amendments, the GovernorW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 154 of 414shall not withhold assent. The role which is ascribed by the
        first proviso to the Governor is recommendatory in nature
        and it does not bind the State Legislature.
23. This is compatible with the fundamental tenet of a
        parliamentary form of Government where the power to enact
        legislation is entrusted to the elected representatives of the
        people. The Governor, as a guiding statesman, may
        recommend reconsideration of the entirety of the Bill or any
        part thereof and even indicate the desirability of introducing
        amendments. However, the ultimate decision on whether or
        not to accept the advice of the Governor as contained in the
        message belongs to the legislature alone. That the message
        of the Governor does not bind the legislature is evident from
        the use of the expression “if the Bill is passed again …with
        or without amendments”.
24. The substantive part ofArticle 200empowers the
        Governor to withhold assent to the Bill. In such an event, the
        Governor must mandatorily follow the course of action which
        is indicated in the first proviso of communicating to the State
        Legislature “as soon as possible” a message warranting the
        reconsideration of the Bill. The expression “as soon as
        possible” is significant. It conveys a constitutional
        imperative of expedition. Failure to take a call and keeping a
        Bill duly passed for indeterminate periods is a course of
        action inconsistent with that expression. Constitutional
        language is not surplusage. In State of Telangana v.
Governor of Telangana [State of Telangana v. Governor of
        Telangana, (2024) 1 SCC 405] this Court observed that “The
        expression ‘as soon as possible’ has significant
        constitutional content and must be borne in mind by
        constitutional authorities.” The Constitution evidently
        contains this provision bearing in mind the importance which
        has been attached to the power of legislation which squarely
        lies in the domain of the State Legislature. The Governor
        cannot be at liberty to keep the Bill pending indefinitely
        without any action whatsoever.
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 155 of 414
25. The Governor, as an unelected Head of the State, is
        entrusted with certain constitutional powers. However, this
        power cannot be used to thwart the normal course of law-
        making by the State Legislatures. Consequently, if the
        Governor decides to withhold assent under the substantive
        part ofArticle 200, the logical course of action is to pursue
        the course indicated in the first proviso of remitting the Bill
        to the State Legislature for reconsideration. In other words,
        the power to withhold assent under the substantive part ofArticle 200must be read together with the consequential
        course of action to be adopted by the Governor under the first
        proviso. If the first proviso is not read in juxtaposition to the
        power to withhold assent conferred by the substantive part ofArticle 200, the Governor as the unelected Head of State
        would be in a position to virtually veto the functioning of the
        legislative domain by a duly elected legislature by simply
        declaring that assent is withheld without any further
        recourse. Such a course of action would be contrary to
        fundamental principles of a constitutional democracy based
        on a Parliamentary pattern of governance. Therefore, when
        the Governor decides to withhold assent under the
        substantive part ofArticle 200, the course of action which is
        to be followed is that which is indicated in the first proviso.
        The Governor is underArticle 168a part of the legislature
        and is bound by the constitutional regime.
26. Insofar as Money Bills are concerned, the power of the
        Governor to return a Bill in terms of the first proviso is
        excluded from the purview of the constitutional power of the
        Governor. Money Bills are governed byArticle 207in terms
        of which the recommendation of the Governor is required for
        the introduction of the Bill on a matter specified in sub-
        clauses (a) to (f) of clause (1) of Article 199.”

                                           (Emphasis supplied)W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 156 of 414
183. Placing reliance on the expression “unless the procedure indicated in the

    first proviso is followed” the learned Attorney General submitted that the

    decision as regards whether the procedure prescribed under the first proviso

    is to be invoked or not, is the discretion of the Governor. It is only when the

    Governor decides to return the withheld bill along with a message that the

    first proviso would come into play. In other words, if the Governor believes

    that the bill is constitutionally infirm and beyond any remedial changes, then

    he may choose not to return the bill along with a message and may simply

    declare that he is withholding assent to the bill, in which case the bill would

    “fall through” or lapse.

184. Although the argument is seemingly lucrative and appealing, and the

    petitioner also could not provide a concrete reply to the same during the

    course of the arguments and instead took shelter under the semantics of

    obiter-dicta and ratio-decidendi, yet we deem it necessary to explain how

    the argument is short-sighted, half-baked and suffers from an inherent

    fallacy.

185. As the observation made by this Court in the three decisionsreferred to

    aboveholds that the Bill would fall through unless the procedure prescribed

    in the first proviso is followed, we first need to understand the procedure

    that is prescribed in the first proviso. The proviso stipulates that when anyW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 157 of 414bill, other than a Money Bill, is presented to the Governor for assent, he

     may, as soon as possible, return it to the State legislature, together with a

     message. As regards the contents of the message, the proviso stipulates that

     the Governor may request the House(s) of the State legislature to reconsider

     the bill or certain parts of it, and also explore the desirability of introducing

     certain amendments as may be suggested by the Governor in the message.

     Once the bill is so returned together with the message, the House(s) are

     required to reconsider the bill in accordance with the recommendations

     contained in the message of the Governor. If the bill is then passed again by

     the House(s), with or without amendments, and presented to the Governor,

     then the Governor cannot withhold assent from such a bill.
186. A close reading of the first proviso reveals that the action of returning the

     bill to the State legislature by the Governor is qualified by the expression

     “as soon as possible”. However, once the bill has been returned to the State

     legislature by the Governor, there is no such expediency required on part of

     the State legislature in reconsidering the bill. Further, once the bill is

     reconsidered and passed again by the State legislature, there is again a

     mandate on the Governor not to withhold assent to such a bill. The only

     obligation upon the State legislature is to mandatorily take into consideration

     the suggestions contained in the message sent by the Governor along with

     the bill. However, the State Legislature is not under an obligation toW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 158 of 414mandatorily introduce any amendments suggested by the Governor and it

     may proceed to repass the bill without any amendments.
187. Since there is no obligation on the State legislature to repass the bill returned

     by the Governor under the first proviso, the expression “falls-through” can

     only refer to those situations where the State legislature elects not to pass

     the bill for reconsideration again, and in such circumstances causing the bill

     to lapse. There is nothing in the first proviso which gives the Governor the

     discretion to initiate the procedural machinery described therein. Therefore,

     the first proviso, cannot be treated as an independent course of action

     severable from the option of withholding of assent. The use of the expression

     “as soon as possible” in the first proviso makes it clear that the Constitution

     has imposed a sense of urgency upon the Governor and expects him to act

     with expediency if he decides to declare the withholding of assent. At the

     same time, that the use of the expression “may” in the first proviso, as

     explained inState of Punjab(supra) does not confer a discretion upon the

     Governor to decide whether to act in accordance with the procedure

     prescribed in the first proviso. On the contrary, it only denotes that the first

     proviso would be applicable only when the option of withholding of assent

     is exercised. In other words, the expression “may” is used keeping in mind

     that there are three options that the Governor may choose from when a bill

     is presented to him for assent.Therefore, there is no requirement forW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 159 of 414construing the expression “may” as “shall” as was vehemently urged on

     behalf of the petitioner, and the interpretation provided inState of Punjab(supra) and further explained by us does not merit construing the use of

     “may” as “shall”, as it would result in a logical absurdity insofar as it would

     make the compliance with the procedurelaid down inthe first proviso

     mandatory in the exercise of all three options available to the Governor

     under the substantive part ofArticle 200of the Constitution.
188. It is also remarkable to take note of the expression “if the bill is passed

     again” which signifies that the ultimate discretion to decide whether the

     State legislature wants to repass the bill or not continues to remain the

     prerogative of the State legislature alone. Similarly, the use of the expression

     “with or without amendment” denotes that even if the State legislature

     decides to reconsider the bill, the discretion to repass it with or without the

     amendments suggested by the Governor again continues to be their sole

     prerogative. In order to obviate any further confusion, we deem it

     appropriate to clarify that the use of the expression “shall reconsider the bill

     accordingly” does not indicate that it is obligatory for the State legislature

     to take up the bill for reconsideration. The word “shall” used in this

     expression must be read in conjunction with the word “accordingly”. The

     use of “shall” in this context is only for the limited purpose that if the State

     legislature in its discretion does decide to not allow the bill to “fall through”W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 160 of 414by taking it up for reconsideration, then the scope of such reconsideration

     must at the very least encompass the suggestions communicated by the

     Governor in his message. The word “shall” used herein cannot be singled

     out and construed devoid of its context.

189. The structure ofArticle 200is also helpful in discerning the meaning of the

     content that it holds. There is a substantive part of the provision and there

     are two provisos to the substantive part. In the substantive part, there are

     three options for the Governor to choose from, each separated by the

     conjunction “or” thereby indicating the mutual exclusivity of the three

     options. If the Governor opts for the first option and grants assent to the bill

     presented to him, the first proviso doesn’t come into consideration.

     Similarly, if the Governor chooses the third option and reserves the bill for

     the consideration of the President, there is no occasion for the operation of

     first proviso. The second proviso is overarching in nature and provides that

     in the situation as described therein, the Governor can only exercise one

     option, that is, reserve the bill for the consideration of the President.
190. The use of the expression “shall declare” in the substantive part ofArticle

     200indicates that the Governor is required to make a declaration from the

     three choices provided to him under the substantive part and there cannot be

     any fourth course of action. As soon as assent is granted, the bill becomesW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 161 of 414an Act and there is no scope thereafter for reservation for the consideration

    of the President or returning back to the State legislature. If reservation for

    the consideration of the President is declared then thereafter no returning of

    the bill to the State legislature can take place, unless the President so directs

    under the proviso toArticle 201.Thus, it is only upon the declaration of

    withholding of assent that the first proviso is animates into action.
191. Another important aspect that may be pointed out is that the observations

    made inValluri Basavaiah Chowdhary(supra) and Hoechst (supra),

    respectively state that except in the case of a Money Bill, the Governor may

    withhold assent. A bare reading ofArticle 200indicates that there is no

    restriction in the substantive part that prohibits the Governor from declaring

    that he withholds assent to a Money Bill, and it is only under the first proviso

    that such a restriction can be found. Therefore, it is only when the option of

    the withholding of assent in the substantive part ofArticle 200is read along

    with the first proviso that Money Bills could be said to be excluded from the

    purview of withholding of assent under the substantive part ofArticle 200.Thus, rather than fortifying the argument of the learned Attorney General,

    the observations made inValluri Basavaiah Chowdhary(supra) and

    reiterated in Hoechst (supra) only reinforce the intricate and inseparable

    connection between the exercise of the option of withholding of assent by

    the Governor and coming into operation of the procedure prescribed in theW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 162 of 414first proviso.The dictum of the above mentioned two decisions in no way

    renders the decision inState of Punjab(supra) per-incuriam, and rather

    bolsters the line of reasoning adopted by this Court therein.
192. Therefore, the use of the expression “the Bill falls through unless the

    procedure indicated in the first proviso is followed” should be construed in

    the context of the entire procedure described in the first proviso. Seen thus,

    it would mean that the bill would fall-through if the bill, having been

    returned by the Governor, is not passed again by the State legislature and

    presented again to the Governor for his assent. The fallacy of the argument

    canvassed by the learned Attorney General lies in the very fact that he has

    construed the observations of this Court, pertaining to compliance with the

    procedural requirement under the first proviso, to mean that the mechanism

    under the first proviso can only be initiated upon the desire and discretion of

    the Governor.

193. This Court inNambudiri(supra) explained as to how the State legislature

    may cause a bill to fall through with which they no longer intend to proceed

    by not reconsidering and repassing it, once it has been returned by the

    Governor with the deceleration of withholding of assent. This Court held

    that the stage of assent could only be arrived at after the stage ofW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 163 of 414reconsideration and repassing by the State legislature has been successfully

    crossed. The relevant observations read as under: -

194. There is one another way of looking atArticle 200.The procedure, as

    prescribed under the scheme of the provision, involves and envisages the

    actual motion of a bill from one constitutional authority to another. The

    Article starts with the requirement of the bill having to be mandatorily

    presented to the Governor after it has been passed by the State legislature.

    Thereafter, there is an obligation on the Governor to make a choice from one

    of the three options provided in the substantive part of the Article and also

    declare such a decision. Here, if assent is declared, then the bill becomes anW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 164 of 414Act and the Government may thereafter take steps to notify the same in the

official Gazette. If the Governor declares that bill is being reserved for

consideration of the President as per the second proviso or otherwise, then

the bill travels from the Governor to the President, whereuponArticle 201comes into play. The mechanism provided in the first proviso also envisages

the movement of the bill from the Governor to the State legislature and then

back to the Governor upon being passed again. The expression “as soon as

possible” appearing in the first proviso infuses a sense of urgency and

expediency in the mechanism of returning of bills by the Governor. It goes

without saying that the scheme ofArticle 200is characterized by the

movement of the bill from one constitutional authority to another and that

too with a sense of expediency. It is trite to say thatArticle 200occupies an

important role of giving the bills passed by the State legislature the authority

of an Act. Without the procedure envisaged underArticle 200, the bills

remain mere pieces of paper, skeletons without any flesh or lifeblood

flowing through their veins, mere documentation of the aspirations of the

people without any possibility of bringing them to fruition. The only way by

which the option of withholding of assent provided in the substantive part

ofArticle 200can be reconciled with the scheme permeating the remainder

of the provision is by reading it in conjunction with the first proviso. It is

only when the withholding of assent is tempered with the requirement of

following the procedure prescribed in the first proviso that the constitutionalW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 165 of 414object of ensuring that the law-making machinery at the State level keeps on

     running unhindered can be fulfilled.

195. Any other reading of the provision that construes the option of withholding

     of assent without attaching it to the mechanism prescribed in the first proviso

     would render the very idea of smooth functioning of the law-making process

     nugatory and would vest with the Governor untrammeled powers of

     thwarting the legislative machinery and in effect the will and aspirations of

     the people whose voices the legislature represents.
196. Thus, in light of the aforesaid discussion, it becomes clear that there are only

     three courses of action available to the Governor to choose from when a bill

     is presented to him for assent underArticle 200.The first proviso is not an

     independent fourth course of action but intrinsically attached to the option

     of withholding of assent. In other words, the first proviso is clarificatory and

     only elaborates the procedure to be followed in case the option of

     withholding of assent is invoked by the Governor.

197. The use of the expression “shall” in the substantive part ofArticle 200read

     with the expression “as soon as possible” used in the first proviso indicates

     that there is no pocket veto available to the Governor while he is exercising

     the powers underArticle 200.As we have also discussed in the subsequentW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 166 of 414parts of this judgment, inaction on part of the Governor to take a decision

    when a bill is presented to him underArticle 200is grossly violative of the

    constitutional scheme of expediency which permeates the provision.
198. The Governor, in exercise of his powers underArticle 200, also does not

    possess any absolute veto. He is mandated to take a decision from among

    the three options that are provided in the substantive part of theArticle 200.In case of withholding of assent, the Governor is bound to follow the

    procedure prescribed under the first proviso and assent to the bill if it is

    ultimately presented to him for assent after being repassed by the State

    legislature. The Governor may also reserve certain bills for the consideration

    of the President. However, in no case has the Governor been conferred with

    the power to veto a bill which is presented to him. He is envisaged as an

    intermediary stop in the journey of the bill towards becoming an Act. When

    a bill comes to the Governor, he may forthwith assent to it, or postpone the

    grant of assent by exercising the option of withholding of assent but only for

    so long till the bill comes back to him after reconsideration, or he may

    forward the bill to the President whereupon the procedure prescribed underArticle 201is to be followed. Thus, in none of these cases can the Governor

    permanently keep a bill with him without according assent to it, nor can he

    declare a simpliciter withholding of assent thereby killing the bill.W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 167 of 414ii.    Whether the Governor can reserve a Bill for the consideration of the
       President when it is presented to him for assent after being
       reconsidered in accordance with the first proviso toArticle 200, more
       particularly, when he had not reserved it for the consideration of the
       President in the first instance?

199. As discussed in the preceding issue, the Governor, in exercise of his powers

      underArticle 200, has three options to choose from. The use of the

      conjunction “or” between the three options signifies that the options are

      mutually exclusive and once one of the options is exercised by the Governor,

      the other options become unavailable to choose from.Kameshwar Singh(supra) held that there can be no reservation for the consideration of the

      President once assent is declared and similarly, there is no requirement for

      the Governor to assent to the bill, once the bill, having been reserved for the

      consideration of the President, has received his assent.
200. We have also discussed in line with the decision inState of Punjab(supra)

      that the option of withholding of assent is attached with the first proviso and

      once the Governor declares the withholding of assent, the entire mechanism

      which islaid down inthe first proviso itself has to follow suit. Thus, the first

      proviso toArticle 200is a complete code in itself as regards the procedure

      which is to be followed once the Governor withholds assent and the rest of

      the article has no applicability thereafter.
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                         Page 168 of 414
201. It is also interesting to note that the expression “withhold assent” has been

     employed in the substantive part ofArticle 200.The literal meaning of the

     expression ‘withhold’ as defined in a number of dictionaries is to keep back;

     to keep in one’s possession what belongs to or is due to others; to hinder; to

     prevent; to defer; to postpone; to detain; to keep under control; to retain; to

     keep from doing something; to refrain from doing something. Thus, it would

     not be incorrect to construe that the option of withholding of assent has been

     provided to the Governor under the substantive part only with a view to defer

     or to postpone the grant of assent to a bill. Withholding of assent cannot be

     construed to be the same as denying of assent or as conferring a power in

     the Governor to veto a legislation passed by the State legislature, which

     would be against the very fundamentals of a representative democracy.
202. Further, the scope of this deferment of assent by the Governor has been made

     subject to the procedurelaid down inthe first proviso. The procedurelaid

     down inthe first proviso ensures that the withholding of assent does not

     become analogous to a pocket veto. The use of the expression “if the Bill is

     passed again by the House or Houses with or without amendment” in the

     first proviso clearly indicates that the role of the Governor under the first

     proviso has been characterized as recommendatory in nature and that his

     suggestions do not bind the legislature. Further, the expression “theW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 169 of 414Governor shall not withhold assent therefrom” in the first proviso leaves no

    scope for the Governor to take any course of action other than discontinuing

    the withholding of assent, which by necessary implication means to accord

    assent to the bill. The expression also indicates that there is strict

    constitutional prohibition against the Governor to not withhold assent to the

    bill.

203. What follows from the aforesaid discussion is that once the option of

    withholding of assent is exercised by the Governor, the mechanism under

    the first proviso is set into motion to the exclusion of everything else

    envisaged under the article. This is in view of the maxim Expressio Unius

    Est Exclusio Alterius i.e., the expression of one thing is the exclusion of

    another. Once the mechanism under the first proviso is set into motion and

    the various stages are complied with, the only possible manner in which the

    mechanism prescribed under the first proviso can conclude is by the

    Governor granting assent to the bill. Thus, there is no scope for the Governor

    to reserve a bill for the consideration of the President once it is presented to

    him for reconsideration after compliance with the procedurelaid down inthe first proviso.

204. However, for the sake of completeness, we deem it necessary to discuss a

    possible scenario wherein the Governor may have the power to reserve theW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 170 of 414bill for the consideration of the President even after it is repassed by the State

    legislature and presented to him for assent. Say, for instance, in a particular

    case, the Governor withholds assent to a bill which is presented to him and

    returns it to the House or the Houses together with a message requesting

    them to reconsider certain aspects of the bill or introduce certain

    amendments desirable thereto. However, the House or the Houses, in the

    process of reconsideration, introduce certain changes which were not

    suggested by the Governor in the message which he sent together with the

    bill. In such a scenario, the House or Houses cannot be said to have

    “reconsidered the Bill accordingly” which is a mandatory condition

    prescribed under the first proviso. If the bill which is presented to the

    Governor for assent in the second round could be said to have been

    reconsidered by the House or Houses on wholly different and new grounds,

    and if those changes are of such a nature where a reservation for the

    consideration of the President may be desirable, then the Governor would

    not be precluded from reserving the bill for the consideration of the

    President.

205. However, if the bill is repassed by the House or Houses without

    amendments, or only with such amendments as were suggested by the

    Governor in his message, then the procedure prescribed under the first

    proviso could be said to be fully complied with and the Governor would beW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                         Page 171 of 414bound to signify his assent thereto and would be precluded from reserving

     the bill for the consideration of the President.

206. We say so because the procedurelaid down inthe first proviso cannot be

     construed as giving the State legislature the unfettered power to introduce

     changes to the bill which alter its very nature, or which, for instance, fall

     foul of the second proviso toArticle 200.In such a scenario, the Governor

     would have all the three options which are available to him when a bill is

     presented to him in the first instance. However, whenever the House or

     Houses reconsider the bill “accordingly”, that is, in accordance with the

     suggestions of the Governor and pass it with or without amendments, the

     Governor is bound to act as per the clear constitutional directivelaid down

     inthe first proviso.

207. As we shall also discuss later, any reservation of a bill by the Governor for

     the consideration of the President on the ground that the bill was not

     reconsidered as per the procedure prescribed in the first proviso would be

     subject to judicial scrutiny.

208. Coming to the facts of the present case, out of twelve bills which are the

     subject matter of the present petition, two were reserved by the Governor for

     the consideration of the President in the first instance of their presentation.W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 172 of 414As regards the remaining ten bills, the Governor declared a withholding of

    assent, however, the bills were returned without any message as is envisaged

    under the first proviso. What stands out as a glaring omission on the part of

    the Governor is that the day on which the withholding of assent was

    declared, the decision inState of Punjab(supra) had already been passed

    and even the notice in the present petition had been issued. Thus, it was

    expected of the Governor that he would not declare a simpliciter withholding

    of assent of the bills without specifying the reasons for such withholding and

    also without making recommendations as regards the desirability of

    introducing any amendments by the State legislature while reconsidering the

    bills.

209.In light of the language ofArticle 200, and also keeping in mind its

    interpretation by this Court inState of Punjab(supra), there was no room

    for the Governor to declare a simpliciter withholding of assent without

    taking recourse to the first proviso as that virtually amounts to the exercise

    of absolute veto by the Governor, a power which is conspicuously absent

    from our constitutional scheme.

210. In the absence of any message under the first proviso by the Governor, the

    State legislature was left with no other option but to proceed on the

    assumption that the bills were required to be reconsidered in its entirety. TheW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 173 of 414State legislature proceeded on this assumption and the said 10 Bills were

       reconsidered in a special sitting and were passed without any material

       changes and presented to the Governor on the same day. Thereafter, the

       Governor, rather than giving his assent to the Bills, went on to reserve the

       Bills for the consideration of the President on the ground that the Bills were

       repugnant to Entry 66 of the List I of the Schedule VII to the Constitution.
211. For the reasons that we have assigned in our foregoing discussion, we are of

       the view that the Governor could not have reserved the Bills for the

       consideration of the President once they were reconsidered by the State

       legislature and presented to him without any amendments, particularly when

       the Governor sent back the Bills to the State legislature without any message

       on an earlier occasion. As a natural consequence of the reservation of the

       bills for the consideration of the President having been found to be in

       contravention of the procedure prescribed underArticle 200of the

       Constitution and thus, illegal and void, any subsequent decision taken by the

       President on those Bills would also be non-est and is thus declared to be void

       ab-initio.
iii.    Whether there is an express constitutionally prescribed time-limit
        within which the Governor is required to act in the exercise of his
        powers underArticle 200of the Constitution?
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 174 of 414
212. It was argued by the petitioner that the Governor in exercise of his powers

     underArticle 200is required to act promptly and the absence of any

     prescribed time period should not be construed as allowing the Governor the

     liberty to act on his own free will and volition. It was also submitted that

     the expression “as soon as possible” appearing in the first proviso places an

     obligation on the Governor to act promptly and with expedience.
213. The petitioner also placed reliance on the recommendations made by the

     Sarkaria Commission and the Punchhi Commission to argue that the Court

     should read in some time-limit into the scheme of Article(s) 200 and201respectively to prevent inaction on the part of the Governor and the

     President.

214. Refuting the contention of the petitioner, the learned Attorney General

     argued that in the absence of any prescribed time-limit in the text of the

     provision, it would not be open to the Court to read in a time-limit and the

     only way to do so would be by way of a constitutional amendment. He

     placed reliance on the decision of this Court inNambudiri(supra) to argue

     that this Court had expressly rejected the idea that there is a time limit which

     circumscribes the exercise of functions of the Governor underArticle 200.W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 175 of 414
215. The arguments advanced before us present an interesting question whether

    it would be open to the courts to read in a time limit for the exercise of a

    power by a constitutional authority where no such limit is prescribed by the

    Constitution. We have expressly held during the course of answering the

    previous issue that the scheme ofArticle 200does not envisage either the

    exercise of a pocket or an absolute veto by the Governor. The use of the

    expression “shall” in the substantive part indicates that the Governor is

    under an obligation to choose from one of the three options that are made

    available to him. By virtue of the first proviso attaching itself to the option

    of withholding of assent, as discussed earlier, the possibility of an absolute

    veto is also ruled out as the Governor must assent to the bill once it is

    presented to him after the procedure prescribed in the first proviso is

    complied with.

216. However, unlike many countries across the globe wherein a provision for

    deemed assent upon the expiry of the specified time period has been made,

    there is no such provision in our Constitution. The only manner in which a

    temporal imperative has been weaved into the scheme ofArticle 200is by

    the use of the expression “as soon as possible” in the first proviso. The said

    expression, which also appears inArticle 111of the Constitution, was the

    subject of some debate in the Constituent Assembly.
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 176 of 414
217.Article 111, which provides for the President’s assent to bills passed by

    Parliament was originally numbered asArticle 91under the Draft

    Constitution and it provided a time-limit of six-weeks to the President to

    send back the bill to the House(s) for reconsideration. The Draft article read

    as follows:
218. During the Constituent Assembly debates, Dr. B.R. Ambedkar moved an

    amendment to substitute the expression “not later than six weeks” with “as

    soon as possible”. Further in the debate, Shri Naziruddin Ahmad advocated

    for a change in the aforesaid amendment and sought to substitute the term

    “as soon as possible” with “as soon as may be”. His contention rested on

    the reasoning that the phrase, “as soon as possible” which was introduced

    by Dr. Ambedkar in his amendment in place of the original wording used inArticle 91, that is, “not later than six weeks”, imposed an unduly stringentW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 177 of 414obligation upon the President. He was of the opinion that “as soon as

        possible” mandates immediate action, thereby curtailing the President’s

        scope to engage in a careful and deliberate review of the bill presented for

        assent. He expressed concern that such a rigid constraint could give rise to

        hasty decisions, devoid of any careful examination of the presented bill. In

        his view, the formulation ran the risk of undermining the quality of the

        President’s judgment underArticle 111.He expressed his opinion as

        follows:
219. To avoid the aforesaid possibilities, Shri Naziruddin Ahmad proposed the

        adoption of “as soon as may be”, which he interpreted to mean “as soon as

        is reasonably practicable”. In his opinion, this change would allow the

        President greater flexibility and sufficient time to thoroughly examine the

        provisions of the bill presented to him. Such freedom would prove

        particularly valuable when the President contemplates returning the bill to108, CONSTITUENT ASSEMB. DEB., (May 20, 1949) 192.
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 178 of 414the House(s) for reconsideration, especially in circumstances where

    amendments might be recommended. The essence of Shri Ahmad’s

    amendment was to safeguard the President’s ability to render well-reasoned

    and thoughtful decisions without any rigid time constraints.
220. Shri P.S. Deshmukh expressed his opposition to the amendment proposed

    by Dr. B.R. Ambedkar, deeming the suggested substitution of the words as

    unnecessary. He, on the other hand, argued that the original phrasing,

    particularly the expression “not later than six weeks”, ought to remain

    unaltered, as it established a precise time frame for the President to act

    accordingly. He further argued that this specific time frame mandated that

    the President must convey his decision to return the bill for reconsideration

    as expeditiously as possible, and in no event beyond six-weeks. He opined

    that preserving the words “not later than six weeks” was quintessential to

    ensure timely action, thereby preventing undue delays in the legislative

    process to send the bills back to the House(s) for reconsideration.
221. Shri H.V. Kamath vehemently opposed the amendment put forward by Dr.

    Ambedkar. Advocating for expeditious and timely action, he argued that,

    “in human nature, if you will permit me to say so, unless there is a

    compelling sense of duty or service, there is always a tendency toW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 179 of 414procrastinate”.11 It was his opinion that such tendencies to procrastinate

        must be rooted out by infusing a standard of duty or service to ensure timely

        action on part of the President. He further opined that there exists no

        assurance that every President of India will consistently adhere to the

        principle of timely action in legislative processes. Therefore, according to

        him, it was very necessary that the “Constitution should provide specifically

        a time limit for a contingency of this nature”12. He believed the phrase “as

        soon as possible” to be vague, purposeless and meaningless, and argued that

        such vague phrases have no place in a provision of such an important nature.
222. In light of the debate which took place on 20 th May 1949, the proposed

        amendment toArticle 91was adopted by the Assembly, thereby substituting

        the expression “not later than six weeks” with “as soon as possible” and the

        same came to be added to the Constitution.

223. What can be postulated from this discussion of the relevant Constituent

        Assembly debates is that although our constitutional makers expressed their

        concerns for the possibility of an undue delay in the legislative process on

        account of the human nature to procrastinate, yet they nevertheless

        proceeded to adopt the phrase “as soon as possible” in the originalArticle118, CONSTITUENT ASSEMB. DEB, (May 20, 1949) 194.
8, CONSTITUENT ASSEMB. DEB. (May 20, 1949) 195.
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                     Page 180 of 414
91. This adoption and amendment of draftArticle 91reflects a sense of

     inherent trust reposed by the Constituent Assembly that the President would

     execute his functions as enshrined underArticle 111of the Constitution in a

     timely and efficient manner.

224. The expression also came to be adopted mutatis mutandis inArticle 200.
The experience of the working of the Constitution, more particularly,Article

     200, has shown that the apprehensions expressed by some of the members

     of the Constituent Assembly have unfortunately proven to be prophecy. As

     we have discussed in the preceding paragraphs, one of the prominent

     grievances of the State governments as recorded by the Sarkaria

     Commission and Punchhi Commission reports was that the exercise of the

     power underArticle 200by the Governor, not being a time-bound process,

     leads to significant legislative delay and that certain bills are withheld in the

     Governor’s secretariat for years.

225. Not taking any action on the bills for an unreasonable and prolonged period

     of time virtually vests the Governor with the power of pocket veto and the

     same cannot be held to be permissible within our constitutional scheme. Dr.

     Singhvi had submitted during the course of his arguments that there is no

     scope for the Governor to decide not to decide.Article 200, being the final

     step in the process of the birth of a legislative enactment, the stage whereinW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 181 of 414life is breathed into an otherwise lifeless document, cannot be interpreted in

    a manner which allows the Governor to remain silent and exhibit inaction

    upon the bills which are submitted to him after having received the approval

    of the majority of the State legislature.

226. This Court inDurga Pada Ghosh v. State of West Bengalreported in (1972)

    2 SCC 656 whilst dealing with a writ in the nature of habeas corpus was

    called upon to examine the meaning and import of the expression “as soon

    as may be” appearing inArticle 22(5)of the Constitution and its significance

    in communication of the grounds of detention and disposal of the

    representation of the detenu. In the said case, the detenu came to be arrested

    and put in preventive detention in December, 1971. The detenu moved a

    representation which was received in early January, 1972. However, his

    representation came to be considered by the State government therein only

    in February, 1972 and his detention was confirmed and communicated in

    March, 1972. The detenu challenged the order of preventive detention

    passed against him on the ground that there was an inordinate delay of

    almost two months on part of the State government in considering his

    representation even though the same had been received in January itself.

    This Court held that the aforesaid expression must be seen in the context of

    the scheme underlyingArticle 22, more particularly, the importance that it

    occupies in the constitutional set-up as regards the personal freedom of anW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 182 of 414individual and in a manner whereby the provision does not lose both its

purpose and meaning. The words “as soon as may be” in such context

implies anxious care on the part of the authority concerned to perform its

duty in this respect, as early as practicable, without avoidable delay. The

course of action which is expected from the concerned authority; being

communication of the grounds of arrest and disposal of the representation,

was required to be considered with a sense of urgency and must be done

with due promptitude or expedition and with reasonable dispatch. It was

further held that although there is no definite time-limit which can be laid

down within which such actions must be done, yet at the same time, whether

the appropriate authority had disposed of its obligation as expeditiously as

possible ought to be looked into keeping in mind the peculiar facts and

circumstances of each case. It further held that such constitutional

obligations cannot be ignored or justified on reasons of administrative delay

except where it is shown that ample arrangements were made to cope with

the situation that led to a delay and a certain degree of priority was accorded.

The relevant observations read as under:
up to the personal freedom of an individual. Sub-articles (1)
        and (2) refer to the protection against arrest and detention of
        a person under the ordinary law. Persons arrested or
        detained under a law providing for preventive detention are
        dealt with in sub-articles (4) to (7). Sub-article (5) says that
        when a person is detained in pursuance of an order under a
        law providing for preventive detention the grounds on which
        the order is made have to be communicated to the person
        concerned as soon as may be and he has to be afforded
        earliest opportunity to represent against the order. The
        object of communicating the grounds is to enable the detenu
        to make his representation against the order. The words “as
        soon as may be” in the context must imply anxious care on
        the part of the authority concerned to perform its duty in this
        respect as early as practicable without avoidable delay.W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 184 of 414Similarly, when the representation is made it is in the fitness
            of things that the said representation should be considered
            with the same sense of urgency with which the grounds are
            intended to be communicated to the detenu. That is the only
            way in which the purpose, for which the earliest
            communication of the grounds to the person concerned is
            provided, can be achieved. The representation must,
            therefore, be considered with due promptitude or expedition
            and without avoidable delay, in other words with reasonable
            dispatch. As held by this Court in Jayanarayan case, the
            representation should be considered as expeditiously as
            possible. As the question of delay in considering the
            representation falls for determination on the facts and
            circumstances of each case the binding force of a past
            precedent for a later case would largely depend on the degree
            of close similarity of the circumstances dealt with therein.

227.InKeisham(supra) the question that arose before this Court was whether

    courts can direct the Speaker to decide disqualification petitions pending

    before it within a reasonable period of time, and this Court speaking

    affirmative held as under:

(ii)   Secondly, it observed that although Paragraph 6 of the Tenth

       Schedule vests the Speaker with an exclusive jurisdiction to decide

       disqualification petitions and ousts the reach of courts in such matters,

       yet it does not mean that there is no scope of judicial review by the

       courts or that the power to pass any direction(s) to the Speaker acting

       under the Tenth Schedule does not exist. It was observed that the true

       purport of such exclusive jurisdiction was only to ensure that no

       obstacle comes in the way of the Speaker in deciding such petitionsW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 186 of 414by way of injunctions from the courts. However, it by no means

        interdicts the exercise of judicial review in aiding a prompt decision

        on such disqualification petitions to ensure that the Speaker decides

        these issues within a reasonable period. The relevant observations

    Telanganareported in (2024) 1 SCC 405 wherein this Court whilst dealing

    with a similar issue pertaining to the pendency of a few bills before the

    Governor of Telangana, held that the expression “as soon as possible” inArticle 200has significant constitutional content and must be borne in mind

    by the constitutional authorities. The relevant observations read as under:
229.InRam Chand(supra) certain parcels of land had been demarcated and

    declared for compulsory acquisition vide a notification, sometime between

    the years 1959-1965. However, the awards for compensation came to be

    passed almost fourteen-years later in the year 1980. These awards came to

    be challenged before this Court on the ground that since the statute in

    question provides for payment of compensation in respect of the acquisition

    made at the market value of the land, as it stood, at the time of publication

    of the notification for declaration, the same necessarily meant that

    compensation ought to be paid expeditiously and without delay. This Court

    held that although the legislature by way of an amendment has now

    prescribed a time-limit for making an award, yet it does not mean that prior

    to such amendment there was no time-limit for payment of compensation or

    that an award could be passed by the authorities at their own pace and

    leisure. It held that where for exercise of any power no time-limit has been

    prescribed, such power has to be exercised within a reasonable period of

    time. It further held that sans any fixed time-limit, such powers cannot beW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 189 of 414exercised or subjected to delay in a manner that violates or circumvents the

object of the statute and the constitutional mandate underArticle 31Aof

230. In A.G. Perarivalan (supra) the facts germane for our discussion are that

    the appellant convict therein had filed a mercy petition underArticle 161to

    the Governor in December, 2015. The State Cabinet recommended the grant

    of remission to the Governor in 2018. However, the Governor did not take

    any decision on the mercy petition for two years despite receiving the

    recommendation of the State Cabinet. Thereafter, upon a direction of this

    Court, the Governor in 2021, by an order, forwarded the mercy petition of

    the appellant to the President citing that the Union is the appropriate

    authority to decide the same. This reference came to be challenged before

    this Court wherein it was held as under:
Our Constitution, though federal in its
                 structure, is modelled on the BritishW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                     Page 192 of 414parliamentary system where the executive is
                 deemed to have the primary responsibility for
                 the formulation of governmental policy and its
                 transmission into law though the condition
                 precedent to the exercise of this responsibility
                 is its retaining the confidence of the legislative
                 branch of the State. The Governor occupies the
                 position of the head of the executive in the State
                 but it is virtually the Council of Ministers in
                 each State that carries on the executive
                 Government. In the Indian Constitution,
                 therefore, we have the same system of
                 parliamentary executive as in England and the
                 Council of Ministers consisting, as it does, of
                 the members of the legislature is, like the
                 British Cabinet, “a hyphen which joins, a
                 buckle which fastens the legislative part of the
                 State to the executive part
20. Under the Cabinet system of Government
                 as embodied in our Constitution the Governor
                 is the constitutional or formal head of the State
                 and he exercises all his powers and functions
                 conferred on him by or under the Constitution
                 on the aid and advice of his Council of
                 Ministers, save in spheres where the Governor
                 is required by or under the Constitution to
                 exercise his functions in his discretion.
Wherever the Constitution requires the
                 satisfaction of the President or the Governor
                 for the exercise of any power or function by the
                 President or the Governor, as the case may be,
                 as for example inArticles 123, 213, 311(2)proviso (c), 317, 352(1), 356 and 360, the
                 satisfaction required by the Constitution is not
                 the personal satisfaction of the President or of
                 the Governor but is the satisfaction of theW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 193 of 414President or of the Governor in the
                 constitutional sense under the Cabinet system
                 of Government. It is the satisfaction of the
                 Council of Ministers on whose aid and advice
                 the President or the Governor generally
                 exercises all his powers and functions.
21. Even though the Governor may be
                 authorised to exercise some functions, under
                 different provisions of the Constitution, the
                 same are required to be exercised only on the
                 basis of the aid and advice tendered to him
                 underArticle 163, unless the Governor has
                 been expressly authorised, by or under a
                 constitutional provision, to discharge the
                 function concerned, in his own discretion.”
(ii)   Secondly, it observed that the law is clear and explicit – the advice

       of the State Cabinet is binding on the Governor when it comes to the

       exercise of powers underArticle 161.In the absence of any other

       provision under the Constitution or any statute in this regard, the

       Governor could not have deviated from the binding recommendations

       of the State Cabinet and referred the mercy petition to the President.

       It was held that such an action is contrary to the constitutional scheme.

       The relevant observations read as under:

        ground for the exercise of judicial review as the said provision

      read as under:
However, as held by this Court in numerous
                 decisions, this Court has the power of judicial
                 review of orders of the Governor underArticle
                 161, which can be impugned on certain grounds.
Non-exercise of the power underArticle 161is

                 State Cabinet has taken a decision to release the
                 prisoner by granting him the benefit of
                 remission/commutation of his sentence.”

(iv)    Lastly, as regards the contention of the respondents that the decision

        of the Governor to forward the mercy petition to the President was

        done in exercise of his discretion owing to the irrational

        recommendation of the Cabinet in line with the ratio of M.P. Special

        Police (supra), this Court held that the aforesaid decision would not

        be applicable, since there is nothing to make out a case of irrational

        or non-consideration of relevant factors by the State government to

        warrant the Governor exercising his discretion and deviating from

        their recommendations as laid down in M.P. Special Police (supra).

        The relevant observations read as under:
On the contrary, it only reinforces the sense of expediency and urgency that

     has been time and again emphasized since the adoption of the Constitution.

     The reason why the prescription of a time-limit does not tantamount to an

     alteration or amendment is because the time-limit that is being prescribed by

     cannot be understood to be a hanging sword on the Governor whereby even

     an unavoidable non-compliance would automatically ensue consequences of

     ‘assent’. The nature of such prescription is quite different which may be

     better explained through the concept of judicial review.
238. For the exercise of judicial review, the existence of a certain set of definitive

     standards against which the courts can embark upon their scrutiny, is

     quintessential. Without these standards, the power of judicial review could

     be said to be ineffective in certain contexts which shall be elucidated upon

     in the latter parts of the judgment. The doctrine of stare-decisis is not just

     concerned with ensuring that decisions of higher courts or of larger benchesW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 204 of 414are duly adhered to and questions of law already settled and put to quietus

    by higher judicial authorities are not disturbed. The idea is also to infuse a

    sense of judicial comity within the intertwined hierarchical courts in the

    manner of their functioning. Additionally, one of the core precepts of stare-

    decisis is that not only the decisions but the very decision-making process

    of the courts are predicated upon a discernible standard, often coined as

    ‘judicially manageable standards’. We shall discuss this in more detail in the

    later parts of this judgment.

239. Any time-limit in the exercise of powers in terms ofArticle 200of the

    Constitution should not be construed as timelines laid within the edifice of

    the provision, rather should be understood as timelines that would serve as

    a lodestar for the purpose of exercise of judicial review by the courts, a

    benchmark tool to aid and enable the courts in ascertaining if any inaction

    or malfeasance has occasioned in the exercise of such powers. These

    timelines no doubt demand the earnest adherence by the Governor, however,

    these being nothing more than tools upon which scrutiny by judicial review

    is to be premised, remain as prescriptions within the realm of judicial review

    alone and do not transgress into the legislative bounds or amount to

    alteration of the text or authority ofArticle 200of the Constitution. The

    reason why these time-lines do not immolate the very fabric ofArticle 200is because the said provision even with the infusion of these time-limit stillW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 205 of 414remains markedly different from its counterpart provisions where such time-
limits are legislatively prescribed. For instance,Article 75of the

     Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan or Article I,Section 7of

     the U.S. Constitution, where if no decision is taken within the stipulated

     time-limit by the President then the bills are deemed to have been assented

     to.

240. Thus, it is important to take note of this very fine but pertinent distinction

     that the prescription of a time-limit by this Court intoArticle 200of the

     Constitution does not fundamentally change the procedure which has been

     envisaged. While the reading in of a time-limit underArticle 200would have

     meant that there would be deemed assent upon failure of the Governor to

     comply with the said timeline, the prescription of a reasonable time period

     does not introduce any such mechanism or deeming fiction inArticle 200.
241. What emerges from the above is that the fine but pertinent distinction

     between the time-limits that are expressly prescribed and those that are

     judicially evolved is only that in the former the consequence of deemed

     assent emanates from the provision itself whereas in the latter there could be

     no such consequence except to the extent that the courts judicially reviewing

     the action or inaction can direct a decision to be taken within a time-bound

     manner, or in exceptional cases like the one at hand, deem the assent to haveW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 206 of 414been granted underArticle 142of the Constitution, which we shall again

     discuss in the later parts of this judgment.

242. When prescribing such a time-limit for the exercise of power underArticle

     200, we are guided by the inherent expedient nature of the procedure

     prescribed thereunder and the well-settled legal principle that where no time-

     limit for the exercise of a power is prescribed, it should be exercised within

     a reasonable period.

243. What would be a reasonable period would vary from situation to situation,

     however, in the present case, taking guidance from the timelines that have

     been prescribed by the Sarkaria and the Punchhi Commission, we have

     arrived at the view that in the absence of any exceptional circumstances, the

     Governor would be able to exercise his powers under the Article within the

     maximum period prescribed by us.

244. While the reading in of an absolute time-limit would have left the Governor

     with no choice but to comply with it, the prescription of the judicially

     evolved time-limits by us leaves it open for the Governor to justify the delay

     caused by providing reasonable grounds. Delay caused by the Governor

     beyond the prescribed time-limits would be justiciable and the courts, with

     deference to applicable judicial principles, would be fully competent toW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 207 of 414ascertain whether the delayed exercise of power by the Governor underArticle 200was based on any reasonable grounds or not.
245. The prescription of a time-limit is with a view to ensure that the Governor

     is not conferred with the power of exercising a pocket veto under the scheme

     ofArticle 200, and hinder the law-making process in the State without the

     existence of any reasonable grounds. While the decision inNambudiri(supra) does not make the prescription of such a time-limit by the Court

     impermissible, the decisions, adverted to above, vest this Court with

     sufficient power to ensure that the procedure prescribed underArticle 200is

     followed by the Governor in a constitutionally permissible manner and in

     line with the principles of parliamentary democracy keeping in mind the

     nature of the power.        Such an approach also ensures that the State

     governments are not left remediless in cases of malicious, arbitrary or

     capricious exercise of power by the Governor underArticle 200.
246. We also deem it necessary to prescribe a timeline for the discharge of

     functions by the Governor underArticle 200.The Sarkaria and Punchhi

     Commissions in their reports adopted this view, keeping in mind the

     importance of an expeditious decision underArticle 200for the smooth

     functioning of electoral democracy in the States. An elected governmentW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                     Page 208 of 414gets the mandate of the people for a limited period of five-years within which

    it is expected to legislate on issues pertaining to the electorate. If the

    Governor, for whatsoever reasons, exhibits reluctance or lethargy in

    decision making, particularly when it is concerned with the assent to bills, it

    severely impacts the ability of the government to act upon its mandate and

    deliver to the people who brought them into power. Any obstacle created by

    the Governor, whether advertently or inadvertently, severely impacts the

    perception of the elected government in the subsequent elections and thereby

    also negatively affecting their chances of coming back into power. The

    problem is further exacerbated when the political party in power in the State

    is different from the one at the Centre, and the Governor should be more

    cautious and non-partisan in the exercise of his functions in such a scenario.

    Any deliberate inaction on part of the Governor in assenting to bills or

    reserving them for the consideration of the President, thus, has to be viewed

    as a serious threat to the federal polity of the country and the aggrieved

    governments cannot be left remediless, desperately waiting for a decision at

    the hands of the Governor.

247. This Court inState of Punjab(supra) held that the Constitution terms any

    inaction on part of the Governor as deplorable and that he cannot indefinitely

    keep the bills passed by the State legislature on a chokehold. The relevant

    observations read as under:
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 209 of 414
248. It is not unusual for this Court to prescribe time-limits for the discharge of

     certain functions, even in cases where no specific time-limit has been

     prescribed. Recently, in Periyammal (Dead) thr. LRs & Ors. v. Rajamani

     & Anr. Etc. reported in 2025 INSC 329, a two-Judge Bench of this Court,

     of which one of us (J.B. Pardiwala, J.) was a part, directed all the High

     Courts to issue directions to all the District Courts to decide pending

     execution petitions within a period of six-months without fail. The directions

     read as follows:
249. We have already discussed that inKeisham(supra), a three-Judge Bench

    of this Court fixed an outer time-limit of three-months for the Speaker to

    decide disqualification petitions under the Tenth Schedule. The Court

    pertinently observed that the said period was fixed “keeping in mind the fact

    that ordinarily the life of the Lok Sabha and the Legislative Assembly of the

    States is five-years”. This Court has also, in a number of decisions, set down

    and reiterated that the High Courts must pronounce judgments on reserved

    matters within a period of six-months. Inaction on part of any constitutional

    authority being subject to judicial review, it is important that there are

    reasonably laid down standards of justiciability of such inaction, and the

    timelines prescribed by us serve that purpose. Even the Constituent

    Assembly had initially laid down a period of six-weeks for the President to

    take action on bills submitted to him underArticle 111.However, that was

    later changed to account for any exceptional circumstance that may arise in

    the discharge of functions by the President or the Governor. However, the

    expression “six-months” was replaced with “as soon as possible”, which

    though not determinable, envisages an expeditious disposal of bills, unless

    in cases where some impossibility exists. The prescription of timelines by

    us balances the objective of expediency as well as the desirability of having

    some flexibility in cases of existence of an impossibility in discharge ofW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 211 of 414functions in an expeditious manner. Flexibility in the discharge of a function

     cannot be allowed to be stretched to an extent that renders the very object

     underlying such function otiose, resulting into the proverbial snapping of the

     constitutional machinery.

250. Keeping in mind the constitutional significance ofArticle 200and the role

     it plays in the federal polity of the country, the following timelines are being

     prescribed. Failure to comply with these timelines would make the inaction

     of the Governors subject to judicial review by the courts:
In case of presentation of bill after reconsideration in accordance

              with the first proviso, the Governor must grant assent forthwith,

              subject to a maximum period of one-month.

251. Failure to comply with the timelines prescribed above would make the

      inaction on part of the Governor amenable to judicial review. We shall also

      deal with the necessity of expeditiously disposing of the references underArticle 201by the President in subsequent parts of this judgment.



iv.    Whether the Governor in the exercise of his powers underArticle 200of the Constitution can only act in accordance with the aid and advice
       tendered to him by the State Council of Ministers?

252. Significant time was spent during the course of the arguments on the key

      issue of the scope of discretion enjoyed by the Governor in exercise of his

      powers underArticle 200, more particularly, as regards the reservation of

      bills for the consideration of the President.

253. Mr. Rohatgi, learned Senior Counsel, submitted that the act of the Governor

      amounts to a subversion of the Constitution. He further emphatically

      submitted that it indeed amounted to a subversion of the Constitution.
254. He also submitted that there was no discretion available to the Governor

      under the scheme ofArticle 200of the Constitution and the only exception

      to the same was provided in the second proviso toArticle 200itself. In other

      words, he contended that the Governor could only reserve a bill against theW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 213 of 414advice tendered to him by the Council of Ministers, if the bill was of a

    description as provided in the second proviso. He submitted that in all other

    cases, the reservation of a bill for the consideration of the President had to

    take place strictly in accordance with the advice of the Council of Ministers.
255. This argument was also endorsed by Dr. Singhvi, who added that the

    observations made inB.K. Pavitra(supra) as regards the discretion of the

    Governor underArticle 200of the Constitution have to be understood in the

    context of the reservation taking place on the aid and advice of the Council

    of Ministers.

256. Mr. Dwivedi, placing reliance on the deletion of the expression “in his

    discretion” from both the substantive part ofArticle 200as well the first

    proviso by the Constituent Assembly, proposed an even stricter

    interpretation ofArticle 200.He argued that the deletion of the expression

    “in his discretion” indicated that the intention of the framers of the

    Constitution was crystal clear that the Governor should have no semblance

    of discretion while exercising his powers underArticle 200and he should

    act in accordance with the advice rendered by the Council of Ministers. He

    further submitted that it is not just reservation of the bills for the

    consideration of the President, but the grant of assent, as well as the decision

    to send the bill back to the State legislature together with a message uponW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 214 of 414the withholding of assent, which must be taken strictly in accordance with

    the advice of the Council of Ministers.

257. The Attorney General, per contra, argued that while exercising his powers

    underArticle 200, the Governor is discharging an important constitutional

    obligation, and even if he does not exercise individual discretion, he may

    still act against the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers if he is so

    required to, in the discharge of his constitutional duties.
258. An answer to the aforesaid question cannot be arrived at without first

    answering the following sub-questions:
Chelmsford Reforms of 1919, which culminated into the GoI Act, 1919,

     marked the early stirrings of responsible government, albeit in a nascent

     form. Despite this shift, the Governor remained central to the provincial

     administration,     continuing      to     wield     significant     authority.
260. The GoI Act, 1935, ushered in the era of provincial autonomy and formally

     required the Governor to act on the advice of the Ministers who were

     accountable to the provincial legislature by abolishing the system of dyarchy

     at the provincial level, while introducing it at the central level. However, the

     Act also conferred upon the Governor certain special responsibilities, such

     as maintaining peace and tranquility within the province and safeguarding

     minority interests. These responsibilities necessitated the exercise of

     discretion by the Governor in specific matters. Further, the autonomy of the

     Governor in such cases remained subject to the general superintendence andW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 216 of 414control of the Governor-General, ensuring oversight over the exercise of his

     individual judgment.

261. The declaration      of Independence brought        about    a fundamental

     transformation in the role of the Governor. Until the Constitution came into

     effect, the provisions of the GoI Act, 1935, as modified by the India

     (Provisional Constitution) Order, 1947 (for short, the “Adaptation Order”),

     governed the administration of the country. Significantly, the Adaptation

     Order omitted the expressions ‘in his discretion’, ‘acting in his discretion’,

     and ‘exercising his individual judgment’ from the Act, signaling a departure

     from the colonial framework.

262. One of the key decisions that the framers of the Constitution had to take was

     to decide the mode of selection of the Governor - whether he should be

     elected by way of a direct election, or selected from a panel of names

     suggested by the State legislature, or nominated by the President. While in

     the early days, the Constituent Assembly leaned towards having an elected

     Governor, as the framing of the Constitution neared its conclusion, there was

     increasing support in favour of having a Governor nominated by the

     President. Jawaharlal Nehru attributed this shift of opinion to the bitter

     experience of partition, which, according to him, opened the eyes of the

     Constituent Assembly to the dangers of separatism and the need for havingW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 217 of 414a political structure which focused more on the character of the nation as a

        Union of States rather than a federation.
b.        Constituent Assembly Debates on the mode of Selection of the
          Governor
263. The speeches made by some of the members of the Constituent Assembly

        onArticle 155of the Constitution broadly encapsulate the ideas which were

        debated and rejected before nomination was selected as the mode of

        appointment for the Governor.

264. Speaking in favour of appointment of Governors by Presidential nomination,

        Shri. H.V. Kamath was of the opinion that the concept of an elected

        Governor would undermine the structure of the country as a Union of States,

        since a Governor elected directly by the people on the basis of adult suffrage

        would place more emphasis on India being a federation. However, according

        to him, “the emphasis today is more upon the Union pattern of our State

        than upon its Federal aspect”13. He believed that an elected Governor, being

        a partisan figure, would inevitably clash with the Chief Minister, thereby

        disrupting the functioning of a cabinet-style government. According to him,

        the role of a constitutional head should be impartial and symbolic, and the

        nomination system was better suited to uphold these principles. He further138, CONSTITUENT ASSEMB. DEB., (May 30, 1949) 428.
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 218 of 414elaborated on the potential tussle that would ensue between an elected

        Governor and the Chief Minister of the State as follows:
265. Shri. Hukam Singh, opting for the middle path, acknowledged the

        difficulties inherent in both pure election and pure nomination for the

        purpose of appointment of Governors. While agreeing with Shri. H.V.

        Kamath on the drawbacks of an elected Governor, such as the potential for148, CONSTITUENT ASSEMB. DEB., (May 30, 1949) 428-429.W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 219 of 414conflict with the Chief Minister and the high costs involved in conducting

    elections, he proposed a balanced alternative, suggesting that a panel of

    candidates be nominated by the State legislature and a Governor be chosen

    from the said panel. This method, while allowing for some discretion would

    also ensure public accountability since the merits of those individuals who

    had been recommended in the panel would be publicly available and if the

    right person was not chosen, then the selection would also be criticized

    publicly. In his view, this approach would reduce favoritism, enhance

    transparency, and provide a safeguard against the abuse of power, striking a

    middle ground between the extremes of election and direct nomination.
266. Shri. Rohini Kumar Chaudhari opposed the nomination of Governors,

    cautioning that a Centre-appointed Governor belonging to a different

    political party than the provincial government could lead to discord and

    undermine provincial autonomy. The friction that would result from

    adopting a system wherein Governors are elected would also exist,

    according to him, when a Governor is nominated, since the nominee of the

    President would not work in harmonious tandem with the Ministry of the

    State which belongs to a different political party than the one which enjoys

    power at the Centre. He argued that electing Governors would ensure that

    they are more attuned to the needs of all communities, including

    marginalized groups like tribal populations in States where the GovernorW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                    Page 220 of 414would have an even more important role to play. He criticized the reliance

        on British precedents and advocated for a more democratic process, such as

        election or selection from a panel, to reflect the will of the people and to also

        safeguard provincial interests.

267. Shri. Alladi Krishnaswami Ayyar was of the view that since the Governor is

        merely a constitutional head of the province and the real executive power

        had been vested in a ministry responsible to the Lower House of the different

        States, it seemed rather unnecessary, under such circumstances, to adopt the

        method of election based on universal suffrage for the appointment of the

        Governors. The nomination of Governors by the President would, in his

        opinion, mitigate constitutional conflicts and foster harmonious relations

        between the Governor and the provincial Cabinet. He argued that an elected

        Governor, deriving authority from universal suffrage, might assert

        dominance over the Cabinet, leading to significant constitutional risks. He

        specifically remarked that, “In the normal working of the Government also

        there is danger of a clash between the Minister and the Governor, whereas the

        whole basis of the constitutional structure we are erecting depends upon the

        harmony between the legislature and the executive, and between the executive

        and the formal head of the Government”.15 Drawing inspiration from the158, CONSTITUENT ASSEMB. DEB, (May 30, 1949) 431.
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 221 of 414Canadian model, he suggested that the President’s appointment of

        Governors, guided by the advice of the provincial Cabinet, would ensure

        stability and sound governance. Furthermore, according to him, “Nowhere

        does the system of election of the Governor exist where the Institution of

        responsible government is the main feature of the Constitution”.16 He believed

        that this system would better serve the interests of the provinces and the

        nation as a whole.

268. It was his belief that while the method of nomination was the most

        appropriate one, a convention of appointing Governors in consultation with

        the State government would grow. This, when read with the other

        discussions which took place in the Constituent Assembly, indicate that the

        framers of the Constitution reposed trust that the Governor would not be a

        cipher of the Central government, would be a person above party politics

        and would not attempt to override the State government with his actions. He

        also supported the idea of having nominated Governors on the ground that

        the intervention of the Governor would be required only in extraordinary

        situations, and an elected Governor may come in conflict with the provincial

        Cabinet by trying to override their decisions. His words are reproduced

        below:
16
269. Shri. P.S. Deshmukh was of the opinion that there exist a few fundamental

        considerations which have to be kept in mind while discussing the

        appointment of the Governor. The first of these fundamental considerations

        was that, “if we decide that the Governor should be elected by the province

        on the basis of adult franchise, then it follows logically that he should be a

        real executive authority. On the other hand, if you want him to be mere

        figurehead, if you want him to have exactly the same position as he has today

        under the 1935 Act and which is exactly the position which is assigned to

        him under the Draft Constitution, you cannot but have him appointed by the

        President.”17. In light of this, he buttressed his view that Governors must be

        nominated and not elected. Regarding the concern that adopting a system of

        nominating the Governor would give undue power to the Prime Minister and

        the President, he opined that the Prime Minister would also be a popular

        Prime Minister and that he can only be there as long as he has the support of

        the Parliament elected by the people at large. Therefore, his view was that

        we must not hesitate in giving powers of patronage to the Prime Minister or

        the President. He also expressed concerns about the potential discord178, CONSTITUENT ASSEMB. DEB., (May 30, 1949) 433.
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                             Page 224 of 414between an elected Governor and the Chief Minister or Premier, which could

        disrupt governance. Apart from the very real possibility of conflicts between

        the elected Governor and the Chief Minister which necessitated appointment

        via nomination, he argued, on the other hand that, if there was no conflict

        and there was perfect agreement or collusion between the Governor and the

        Chief Minister, they could agree in defying the Centre altogether and that

        would put the Centre in a precarious position where they would be

        completely blocked out from the States. Therefore, he remarked that, “But

        apart from the conflict, if there is no conflict and there is perfect agreement,

        if these two gentlemen set the Centre at naught, what will be the position?”18.

        Hence, in his opinion, the appointment of Governors by the President would

        maintain a balance of power and ensure some degree of Central influence

        over provincial matters. He further suggested that Governors should serve

        at the pleasure of the President, thereby eliminating the need for

        impeachment provisions and also reinforcing the oversight of the Centre.
270. Shri. Hriday Nath Kunzru highlighted the potential for friction between

        Governors and their Cabinets, specifically with reference toArticle 175of

        the Draft Constitution, which has now been adopted asArticle 200.By

        drawing comparisons to the Canadian model, he argued that empowering188, CONSTITUENT ASSEMB. DEB., (May 30, 1949) 434.
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 225 of 414the President to disallow provincial bills directly by overriding the assent of

        the Governor within a certain prescribed period of time from the date of such

        assent, rather than relying on the Governors as intermediaries who refer the

        bill for the consideration of the President, would centralize responsibility

        with the Central Executive and reduce conflicts at the provincial level. In his

        view, this approach would align with the principles of responsible

        government and ensure smoother governance.

271. Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru emphasized the need to foster unity and avoid

        separatist tendencies within the nation. He believed that an elected Governor

        could exacerbate provincial divisions and weaken ties with the Centre. In his

        opinion, “Nevertheless a certain convention and practice helps or hinders

        the growth of separatist tendencies. I feel that if we have an elected

        Governor that would to some extent encourage that separatist provincial

        tendency more than otherwise. There will be far fewer common links with

        the Centre.”19 He argued that duplicating the electoral process for the office

        of Governor would be unnecessary and counterproductive, leading to

        conflicts, wastage of resources, and disruptive tendencies. Supporting the

        nomination of Governors, he asserted that this approach would align with198, CONSTITUENT ASSEMB. DEB., (May 31, 1949) 455.

     between the provinces and the Centre.
c.    Constituent Assembly Debates on the Exercise of Discretion by the
      Governor
272. The other key question which fell for the consideration of the Constituent

     Assembly was whether any discretion would be made available to the

     Governor as the constitutional head of the State.Article 163(1)of the

     Constitution, which describes the nature of such discretionary powers, reads

     as follows:
273. To understand the true import and the scope of this discretion which exists

     with the Governor, it would be apposite for us to look into the Constituent

     Assembly debates pertaining to this Article in some detail.Article 163which

     provides for the Council of Ministers to aid and advice the Governor was

     earlier numbered asArticle 143under the Draft Constitution. Two

     amendments were sought to be moved to draftArticle 143on the 1st of July

     1949; however, those did not gain the approval of the Constituent AssemblyW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 227 of 414and the original version of draftArticle 143came to be later adopted asArticle 163as we see it today.

274. Of the two amendments, one of which was moved by Shri. H.V. Kamath

        sought to delete the expression, “except in so far as he is by or under this

        Constitution required to exercise his functions or any of them in his

        discretion”. Shri. H.V. Kamath was of the opinion that the draft Article had

        been blindly copied from the GoI Act, 1935, without any mature

        consideration. He further remarked that, “There is no strong or valid reason

        for giving the Governor more authority either in his discretion or otherwise

        vis-a-vis his ministers, than has been given to the President in relation to his

        ministers”20. Investing such wide discretionary powers on the Governor was

        all the more problematic, according to him, since Governors are nominated

        to their positions and not elected. No departure from the principles of a

        constitutional government must be favored except for reasons of emergency

        and therefore, he advocated for these discretionary powers to be done away

        with.

275. However, Shri. T. T. Krishnamachari pointed out that there existed specific

        provisions under the Draft Constitution wherein the Governor was in fact

        empowered to act in his discretion, irrespective of the advice tendered by his208, CONSTITUENT ASSEMB. DEB., (Jun. 1, 1949) 489.
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 228 of 414Council of Ministers. Therefore, according to him, there were two ways of

        drafting which would capture the aforesaid underlying idea: One, would be

        to make a mention of this exception under draftArticle 143itself and

        enumerate the specific scenarios where the Governor would be able to

        exercise his discretion in the subsequent relevant articles or; Two, would be

        to leave out any mention of this discretionary power under draftArticle 143and only state it in the appropriate article that will follow. In the case of draftArticle 143, according to him, it was only that the former method had been

        followed. Therefore, the general proposition or the default rule would be that

        “the Governor has normally to act on the advice of his Ministers except in

        so far as the exercise of his discretions covered by those Articles in the

        Constitution in which he is specifically empowered to act in his

        discretion.”21
276. As an illustration, Shri. T.T. Krishnamachari referred to draftArticle 188which related to the proclamation of Emergency in States by the Governor

        under his discretion. It was his opinion that if such a discretionary power can

        be given under draftArticle 188, there is no harm in the mention of

        discretion under draftArticle 143either. He understood the scheme of the

        draft Constitution to mean that unless there is a specific mention of218, CONSTITUENT ASSEMB. DEB, (Jun. 1, 1949) 491.
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                          Page 229 of 414discretion under any subsequent Article, the discretionary power mentioned

        under draftArticle 143cannot at all be exercised.

277. Shri. Brajeshwar Prasad was not in favor of the amendment that was put

        forth since he was of the opinion that the Governor should be vested not only

        with the power to act in his discretion but also with the power to act in his

        individual judgement. He was of the view that there was a dearth of

        leadership in the provinces wherein competent men were not available and

        unless the Governor is vested with large powers, it would be difficult to

        effect any improvement in the provincial administration. He went to the

        extent of saying that though such a procedure may be considered as

        undemocratic, it would be in the interest of the country. He remarked that,

        “I cannot allow democracy to jeopardize the vital interests of the country

        […] The masses who ought to be the rulers of this land are down-trodden

        and exploited in all ways. Under these circumstances there is no way left

        open but for the Government of India to take the Provincial administrations

        in its own hands”22. In his opinion, federalism could not succeed in a country

        which was passing through a transitory period and therefore, he subscribed

        to the view that power must be vested at the Centre and as a natural corollary,

        the Governor must be able to act in his discretion.

278. Shri. Mahavir Tyagi was also in agreement with the view that the Governor

        must be granted discretion. In his opinion, the State must be kept linked

        together with the Centre and the Governor would be the agent who guards

        the Central policy in the provinces/States. There would be certain subject-

        matters which affect the whole body politic and the provinces/States cannot

        be left free of the policy at the Centre. Since the policy which is evoked in

        the Centre must be followed by all the States, and if the Governors were to

        be in the hands of the provincial Ministers, then there will be various policies

        in various provinces and ministers of various types having different party

        labels and programmes would push their own agenda. Therefore, it was his

        view that, “The Governor being the agency of the Centre would be the only

        guarantee to integrate the various provinces/States”23. According to him,

        this is why the Governor’s discretionary powers should not be interfered

        with. He went on to remark that democratic trends are like a wild beast and

        that it goes by the whims and fancies of the parties and the masses. There

        must be some machinery which would keep this wild beast under control. It

        is in such a reality that the Governor exercising his discretion acts as a

        guardian of the Central policy on one side and the Constitution on the other.238, CONSTITUENT ASSEMB. DEB., (Jun. 1, 1949) 495.
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 231 of 414
279. Shri. B.M. Gupta was of the view that if certain powers had to be given to

    the Governor, our endeavor must be to restrict them as far as possible so that

    the Governor’s position as a constitutional head may be maintained.
280. Shri. Alladi Krishnaswami Ayyar echoed the stance taken by Shri T.T.

    Krishnamachari. He stated that, in the first place, a general principle underArticle 143is laid down, namely, the principle of ministerial responsibility

    that the Governor in the various spheres of executive activity should

    normally act on the advice of his ministers. Then, the Article goes on to

    carve out an exception as regards the matters under which the Governor is

    required to exercise certain functions under his own discretion. Therefore, it

    was his conclusion that as long as there are articles under the Constitution

    which enable the Governor to act in his discretion, the draftArticle 143as it

    was framed was perfectly in order. In certain circumstances, this exercise of

    discretion may be to override the Cabinet or to refer to the President. If later

    on, the Constituent Assembly were to arrive at the conclusion that those

    subsequent Articles which enable the Governor to act in his discretion in

    specific cases must be deleted, it would be open to revise draftArticle 143.But as long as there are Articles occurring later in the Constitution which

    permit the Governor to act in his discretion and not on ministerial

    responsibility, the present draftArticle 143was drafted rightly.W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 232 of 414
281. The only other question, in his opinion, was to see whether the Constituent

        Assembly had to first make a provision under draftArticle 143that the

        Governor shall mandatorily act on ministerial responsibility and then go on

        to provide “Notwithstanding anything contained inArticle 143, [...] he can

        do this” or that “Notwithstanding anything contained inArticle 143, he can

        act in his discretion” in the subsequent relevant Articles. However, he

        favored the method of drafting that had already been adopted i.e., to provide

        in draftArticle 143itself that the Governor shall always act on ministerial

        responsibility excepting in particular or specific cases where he is

        empowered to act in his discretion. If, of course, the Constituent Assembly

        came to the conclusion that in no case the Governor shall act in his

        discretion, and that he shall in every case act only on ministerial

        responsibility, then there will be a consequential change to this Article.
282. Pandit Thakur Das Bhargava adopted the notion that the Governor “shall be

        a guide, philosopher and friend of the Ministry as well as the people in

        general, so that he will exercise certain functions some of which will be in

        the nature of unwritten conventions and some will be such as will be

        expressly conferred by this Constitution.”24 The Governor’s role would248, CONSTITUENT ASSEMB. DEB., (Jun. 1, 1949) 497.
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 233 of 414transcend party politics and he would look at the Minister and the State

government from a detached standpoint. He would also be able to influence

the ministers and members of the legislature in such a manner that the

administration would run smoothly. In such a circumstance, to say that he is

merely a dummy, an automaton or a dignitary without powers would be

gravely wrong. According to his conception of a constitutional Governor,

the Governor would have to accept the advice of his ministers in many

matters but there may also exist many other matters in which such an advice

will either be unavailable or wherein he will not be bound to accept that

advice. Another illustration, according to him, of when the Governor would

act in his discretion would be under draftArticle 147 (Article 167as it stands

today) where the Governor can exercise his power of calling for certain

information from the Chief Minister. Under this Article, the Governor is

competent to ask the Chief Minister to place any matter before the Council

of Ministers which only one minister might have decided. When he calls for

such information, he will be acting in the exercise of his discretion and may

call for any kind of information with a view to control and restrain the

ministry from undertaking irresponsible acts. Therefore, he remarked that,

“In my opinion taking the Governor as he is conceived to be under theW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 234 of 414Constitution, he will exercise very important functions and therefore it is

        very necessary to retain the words relating to his discretion in article 143”25.
283. Shri. Rohini Kumar Chaudhuri put forth the alternate view that it is always

        better to be governed by the will of the people than to be governed by the

        will of a single person who could act in his discretion. He remarked that, “If

        this Governor is given the power to act in his discretion there is no power

        on earth to prevent him from doing so. He can be a veritable King Stork.”26.

        Furthermore, the draftArticle 143itself states that wherever the Governor

        thinks that he is acting in his discretion, he cannot be questioned. According

        to him, in this day and age, we must not countenance such a state of affairs.
284. While concluding the debate on draftArticle 143, Dr. B. R. Ambedkar

        elaborated that the main and crucial question under this draft Article was

        whether the Governor must have certain discretionary powers or not. During

        the course of the debate, it was pointed out that the retention of discretionary

        powers in the Governor was contrary to responsible government in the

        States/provinces. It was also stated that the same mimicked the GoI Act,

        1935, which was largely assailed as being undemocratic. However, Dr. B.

        R. Ambedkar was of the undoubted view that “the retention in or the vesting25Ibid.
8, CONSTITUENT ASSEMB. DEB., (Jun. 1, 1949) 499.
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 235 of 414the Governor with certain discretionary powers is in no sense contrary to or

        in no sense a negation of responsible government.”27 He cited Section 55 of

        the Canadian Constitution which read as follows:
285. He conveyed that the Canadians and the Australians had not found it

        necessary to delete these provisions even in this day and age and that they

        were quite satisfied with its retention. This, he argued, was demonstrative of

        the fact that the grant of such a discretion to the Governor is fully compatible

        with a responsible government. If they had felt otherwise, they had the

        fullest right to abrogate this provision and would have done so. Therefore,

        the existence of a provision vesting a certain amount of discretion in the

        Governor cannot be questioned. Furthermore, the draft Article reads that,

        “Except in so far as he is by or under this Constitution” and not that “except

        wherever he thinks that he should exercise this power of discretion against

        the wishes or against the advice of the ministers”28. Therefore, the clause is

        very limited in nature and would have to be read in conjunction with such278, CONSTITUENT ASSEMB. DEB., (Jun. 1, 1949) 500.
8, CONSTITUENT ASSEMB. DEB., (Jun. 1, 1949) 501.
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 236 of 414other Articles which specifically reserve the discretionary power for the

    Governor. It must not be construed as a general clause which gives the

    Governor the power to disregard the advice of his ministers in any matter in

    which he finds that he could disregard their opinion.
286. Now moving on to how an Article providing for a certain amount of

    discretionary powers to the Governor is to be framed, Dr. B. R. Ambedkar

    elaborated that there are several ways in which the same can be done. One

    way could be to omit the words from draftArticle 143and to add to draftArticles 175 (presentlyArticle 200), 188, or such other provisions, an

    express mention which vests the Governor with discretionary power. Those

    Articles would then mention that notwithstanding draftArticle 143, the

    Governor would have a certain discretionary power. Another way would be

    to state in draftArticle 143itself that “except as provided in draftArticles

    175, 188etc.”, the Governor shall act in accordance with the aid and advice

    of the Council of Ministers with the Chief Minister at the head. However,

    irrespective of what method of drafting is adopted, the essential point that

    would remain is that the Governor’s discretionary power must be

    acknowledged in some form.

287. Dr. B. R. Ambedkar was open and quite willing to concede to the position

    of those members who were of the view that the last portion of clause (1) ofW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 237 of 414draftArticle 143must be amended to mention the specific Articles under

    which the Governor shall exercise discretion, if at that stage of the

    Constituent Assembly debates the provisions intended for such vesting were

    already determined. The difficulty was that the Constituent Assembly had

    not yet arrived at a stage where they could discuss draftArticles 175or 188,

    nor had they exhausted all the possibilities of other provisions being made

    which vested the Governor with discretionary power. If all those

    possibilities were already known, draftArticle 143could have been

    amended and those specific Articles could have been mentioned or listed

    out. Therefore, Dr. B. R. Ambedkar was firmly of the view that no wrong

    could be done if the words as they stood in the draft Article were retained.
288. While acknowledging that there exists a material difference between draftArticle 61(1) (Article 74(1) as it stands today) relating to the executive

    functions of the President vis-à-vis his Ministers and the draftArticle 143,

    Dr. B. R. Ambedkar elucidated that it was not the intention of the drafters to

    vest any discretionary power upon the President. It is because the provincial

    governments are required to work in subordination to the Central

    government and in order to ensure that they do act in such subordination, the

    Governor would reserve certain matters, thereby giving the President an

    opportunity to see that they are broadly in compliance with the policy of the

    Central government. Through this mechanism, the President would be ableW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 238 of 414to ensure that the rules under which the provincial governments are

    supposed to act, according to the Constitution, are observed. Therefore, the

    vesting of discretionary powers in the post of the Governor was considered

    crucial to enable this administrative dialogue between the Centre and the

    provinces.

289. What flows from a study of the Constituent Assembly debates concerning

    the appointment of the Governor and the scope of his discretionary powers

    is that the Governor plays a very crucial role in the political structure of the

    country. He is the bridge between the governments at the Central and State

    level, the proverbial buckle which ties the States with the Centre. The

    Punchhi Commission Report also acknowledged this dual role of the

    Governor – one as the custodian of the Constitution in the States and a

    representative of the Union, and the other as the constitutional head of the

    State and a “friend, philosopher and guide” of the State government as well

    as the people. The position of the Governor and how it differs from that of

    the President were discussed by Dr. B. R. Ambedkar as we have elaborated

    in the preceding paragraphs. This difference was also taken note of by

    Krishna Iyer J., in his opinion inSamsher Singh(supra) as we will discuss

    subsequently. We are of the firm view that this unique position of the

    Governor must be kept in mind whenever we set out to interpret any

    provision of the Constitution pertaining to any gubernatorial powers orW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 239 of 414functions. It is not terminologies like “federal”, “quasi-federal” or “unitary”

     which should guide our interpretation of the Constitution. In turn, the words

     and ideas of the wise artisans, who carefully weaved the fabric of the

     Constitution with threads borrowed from across the world after dying them

     in colors uniquely Indian, that we should look towards, when in doubt about

     the fundamental ideas of our Constitution. The framers of the Constitution

     were cognizant of the fact that vesting the Centre with excessive powers

     would not be healthy for the country’s polity. In this regard we may refer to

     the observations made by the Sarkaria Commission – “there is considerable

     truth in the saying that undue centralization leads to blood pressure at the

     Centre and anemia at the periphery. The inevitable result is morbidity, and

     inefficiency. Indeed, centralization does not solve but aggravates the

     problems of the people.” Therefore, the curtailing of the powers of the

     Governor under the Constitution as distinguished from the GoI Act, 1935

     was done keeping in mind that the Centre does not arrogate all powers to

     itself by utilizing the Governor as an intermediary of the Centre at the State.
290. Arijit Pasayat, J., in his dissenting opinion in the decision of this Court inRameshwar Prasad(supra), observed thus on the role of the Governor:
The founding fathers deliberately avoided election to the
        office of the Governor, as is in vogue in the USA to insulateW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 241 of 414the office from linguistic chauvinism. The President has been
        empowered to appoint him as executive head of the State
        underArticle 155in Part VI, Chapter II. The executive power
        of the State is vested in him byArticle 154and exercised by
        him with the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers, the
        Chief Minister as its head. UnderArticle 159the Governor
        shall discharge his functions in accordance with the oath to
        protect and defend the Constitution and the law. The office of
        the Governor, therefore, is intended to ensure protection and
        sustenance of the constitutional process of the working of the
        Constitution by the elected executive and giving him an
        umpire's role. When a Gandhian economist member of the
        Constituent Assembly wrote a letter to Gandhiji of his plea
        for abolition of the office of the Governor, Gandhiji wrote to
        him for its retention; thus, the Governor had been given a
        very useful and necessary place in the scheme of the team. He
        would be an arbiter when there was a constitutional deadlock
        in the State and he would be able to play an impartial role.
        There would be administrative mechanism through which the
        constitutional crisis would be resolved in the State. The
        Governor thus should play an important role. In his dual
        undivided capacity as head of the State he should impartially
        assist the President. As a constitutional head of the State
        Government in times of constitutional crisis he should bring
        about sobriety. The link is apparent when we find thatArticle
        356would be put into operation normally based on the
        Governor's report. He should truthfully and with high degree
        of constitutional responsibility, in terms of his oath, inform
        the President that a situation has arisen in which the
        constitutional machinery in the State has failed and the
        Government of the State cannot be carried on in accordance
        with the provisions of the Constitution, with necessary
        detailed factual foundation.”
                                           (Emphasis supplied)W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                     Page 242 of 414
291. A Constitution Bench of this Court inB.P. Singhal v. Union of Indiareported in (2010) 6 SCC 331 observed that the Governor is neither an

    employee of the Union nor the agent of the party in power. The relevant

    observations are extracted below:
292. The question of whether the Governor is bound to act on the aid and advice

    of the Council of Ministers in all circumstances fell for the consideration of

    this Court inSamsher Singh(supra). Speaking for the majority, A.N. Ray

    C.J., observed as follows:
To illustrate,Article 239(2)states that where a Governor is
        appointed an administrator of an adjoining Union territory
        he shall exercise his functions as such administrator
        independently of his Council of Ministers. The other articles
        which speak of the discretion of the Governor are paragraphs
        9(2) and 18(3) of the Sixth Schedule andArticles 371-A(1)(b),
        371-A(1)(d)and371-A(2)(b)and371-A(2)(f).The discretion
        conferred on the Governor means that as the constitutional
        or formal head of the State the power is vested in him. In this
        connection, reference may be made toArticle 356which
        states that the Governor can send a report to the President
        that a situation has arisen in which the government of the
        State cannot be carried on in accordance with the provisions
        of this Constitution. AgainArticle 200requires the Governor
        to reserve for consideration any Bill which in his opinion if it
        became law, would so derogate from the powers of the High
        Court as to endanger the position which the High Court is
        designed to fill under the Constitution.
55. In making a report underArticle 356the Governor will
        be justified in exercising his discretion even against the aid
        and advice of his Council of Ministers. The reason is that the
        failure of the constitutional machinery may be because of the
        conduct of the Council of Ministers. This discretionary power
        is given to the Governor to enable him to report to the
        President who, however, must act on the advice of his
        Council of Ministers in all matters. In this contextArticle
        163(2)is explicable that the decision of the Governor in his
        discretion shall be final and the validity shall not be called in
        question. The action taken by the President on such a report
        is a different matter. The President acts on the advice of his
        Council of Ministers. In all other matters where the Governor
        acts in his discretion he will act in harmony with his CouncilW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 245 of 414of Ministers. The Constitution does not aim at providing a
            parallel administration within the State by allowing the
            Governor to go against the advice of the Council of Ministers.
56. Similarly,Article 200indicates another instance where
            the Governor may act irrespective of any advice from the
            Council of Ministers. In such matters where the Governor is
            to exercise his discretion, he must discharge his duties to the
            best of his judgment. The Governor is required to pursue such
            courses which are not detrimental to the State.”

                                             (Emphasis supplied)
293. A reading of the observations reproduced above indicates that the Court

    identified that the Governor was required to act on his discretion when

    performing his functions, inter alia, underArticles 356and200of the

    Constitution respectively. However, it is pertinent to note that underArticle

    200, only the reservation of bills falling under the second proviso was

    observed by the Court to be an exercise which must be undertaken by the

    Governor independent of the advice of the Council of Ministers.
294. Furthermore, this Court laid down a general rule that the Governor, in the

    Cabinet form of government envisaged by the Constitution, acts as a

    constitutional head performing all his functions and exercising all his powers

    on the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers, except in a limited area.

    This limited area of discretion, too, is provided by the Constitution under the

    specific provisions wherein such exercise of discretion is permissible. TheW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 246 of 414Court gave certain illustrative examples where the expression “acts in his

     discretion” was used and observed that such provisions indicated that a

     special responsibility on the Governor has been entrusted upon by the

     Constitution.

295. It is pertinent to observe the observations made by the Court in paragraphs

     54, 55 and 56 ofSamsher Singh(supra) which are reproduced above. In

     paragraph 54, while giving illustrations of the provisions where the

     Governor is expressly required by the Constitution to act in his discretion,

     the Court made reference toArticles 356and200respectively. In the context

     ofArticle 200, the Court observed that the limited area where express

     discretion has been conferred upon the Governor falls under the second

     proviso. Thereafter, in paragraph 55, the Court elaborated upon the exercise

     of discretion by the Governor underArticle 356.In paragraph 56, the Court

     elaborated upon the exercise of discretion underArticle 200and observed

     thatArticle 200“indicates another instance where the Governor may act

     irrespective of any advice from the Council of Ministers”. It is important to

     read the observations made in paragraph 56 along with paragraph 54 of the

     judgment. A conjoint reading of these two paragraphs, it becomes clear,

     without a cavil of doubt, that the second proviso toArticle 200is an instance

     under the Constitution where the Governor has been conferred with the

     power to act in his discretion and even against the advice of the Council ofW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 247 of 414Ministers. However, the logical sequitur to this is that underArticle 200,

     there is no scope for the Governor acting in his discretion other than the

     second proviso.

296. Speaking for himself and P.N. Bhagwati J., the redoubtable Krishna Iyer J.,

     inSamsher Singh(supra) observed as follows:
controlled by the Union Ministry which is answerable to
        Parliament for those actions. Again, a minimal area
        centering round reports to be despatched underArticle 356may not, in the nature of things, be amenable to Ministerial
        advice. The practice of sending periodical reports to the
        Union Government is a pre-constitutional one and it is
        doubtful if a Governor could or should report behind the back
        of his Ministers. For a Centrally appointed constitutional
        functionary to keep a dossier on his Ministers or to report
        against them or to take up public stances critical of
        Government policy settled by the Cabinet or to interfere in
        the administration directly — these are unconstitutional faux
        pas and run counter to Parliamentary system. In all his
        constitutional ‘functions’ it is the Ministers who act; only in
        the narrow area specifically marked out for discretionary
        exercise by the Constitution, he is untramelled by the State
        Ministers' acts and advice. Of course, a limited free-wheeling
        is available regarding choice of Chief Minister and dismissal
        of the Ministry, as in the English practice adapted to Indian
        conditions.
xxx           xxx          xxx
154. We declare the law of this branch of our Constitution to
        be that the President and Governor, custodians of all
        executive and other powers under various articles shall, by
        virtue of these provisions, exercise their formal constitutionalW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 249 of 414powers only upon and in accordance with the advice of their
        Ministers save in a few well-known exceptional situations.
        Without being dogmatic or exhaustive, these situations relate
        to (a) the choice of Prime Minister (Chief Minister),
        restricted though this choice is by the paramount
        consideration that he should command a majority in the
        House; (b) the dismissal of a Government which has lost its
        majority in the House, but refuses to quit office; (c) the
        dissolution of the House where an appeal to the country is
        necessitous, although in this area the head of State should
        avoid getting involved in politics and must be advised by his
        Prime Minister (Chief Minister) who will eventually take the
        responsibility for the step. We do not examine in detail the
        constitutional proprieties in these predicaments except to
        utter the caution that even here the action must be compelled
        by the peril to democracy and the appeal to the House or to
        the country must become blatantly obligatory. We have no
        doubt that de Smith's statement [ Constitutional and
        Administrative Law — by S.A. De Smith — Peguin Books on
        Foundations of Law] regarding royal assent holds good for
        the President and Governor in India:
He further observed that the discretionary powers of the Governor existed

    only where they were expressly spelt out in the Constitution, and even the

    exercise of such discretion was remote-controlled by the Union Ministry.
298. Referring to the decision inSamsher Singh(supra), Krishna Iyer J., inMaru Ram v. Union of Indiareported in (1981) 1 SCC 107, again,

    reiterated the position of the President and the Governor as figureheads in

    the constitutional scheme. However, he observed that they acted in

    accordance with the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers “save in a

    narrow area of power” and that the “Governor vis-à-vis his Cabinet is no

    higher than the President save in a narrow area which does not include

    Article 161”, thereby implying that there is a small area of discretion

    available with the Governor, which however does not includeArticle 161.The relevant observations are reproduced hereinbelow:
299. A Constitution Bench of this Court while dealing with the issue of

    discretionary powers of the Governor in M.P. Special Police (supra) and

    explaining the import ofArticle 163(2)of the Constitution, observed that

    even if discretion was not expressly granted upon the Governor by a specific

    provision of the Constitution, it was open to him to act in his discretion in

    certain exceptional situations where by reason of threat to democraticW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 252 of 414principles, he could not act on the advice of the Council of Ministers. The

relevant observations are reproduced hereinbelow:
A(1)(b), 371-A(2)(b), 371-A(2)(f) and paras 9(2) and 18(3) of
        the Sixth Schedule are some of the provisions. However,
        merely because the Constitution of India expressly provides,
        in some cases, for the Governor to act in his discretion, can
        it be inferred that the Governor can so act only where the
        Constitution expressly so provides? If that were so then sub-
        clause (2) ofArticle 163would be redundant. A question
        whether a matter is or is not a matter in which the Governor
        is required to act in his discretion can only arise in cases
        where the Constitution has not expressly provided that the
        Governor can act in his discretion. Such a question cannot
        arise in respect of a matter where the Constitution expressly
        provides that the Governor is to act in his discretion.Article
        163(2), therefore, postulates that there can be matters where
        the Governor can act in his discretion even though the
        Constitution has not expressly so provided.
12. […] Thus, as rightly pointed out by Mr Sorabjee, a seven-
        Judge Bench of this Court has already held that the normalW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 253 of 414rule is that the Governor acts on the aid and advice of the
        Council of Ministers and not independently or contrary to it.
        But there are exceptions under which the Governor can act
        in his own discretion. Some of the exceptions are as set out
        hereinabove. It is, however, clarified that the exceptions
        mentioned in the judgment are not exhaustive. It is also
        recognised that the concept of the Governor acting in his
        discretion or exercising independent judgment is not alien to
        the Constitution. It is recognised that there may be situations
        where by reason of peril to democracy or democratic
        principles, an action may be compelled which from its nature
        is not amenable to Ministerial advice. Such a situation may
        be where bias is inherent and/or manifest in the advice of the
        Council of Ministers.
xxx          xxx           xxx
19.Article 163has been extracted above. Undoubtedly, in a
        matter of grant of sanction to prosecute, the Governor is
        normally required to act on aid and advice of the Council of
        Ministers and not in his discretion. However, an exception
        may arise whilst considering grant of sanction to prosecute a
        Chief Minister or a Minister where as a matter of propriety
        the Governor may have to act in his own discretion. Similar
        would be the situation if the Council of Ministers disables
        itself or disentitles itself.
xxx          xxx           xxx
32. If, on these facts and circumstances, the Governor cannot
        act in his own discretion there would be a complete
        breakdown of the rule of law inasmuch as it would then be
        open for Governments to refuse sanction in spite of
        overwhelming material showing that a prima facie case is
        made out. If, in cases where a prima facie case is clearly
        made out, sanction to prosecute high functionaries is refused
        or withheld, democracy itself will be at stake. It would then
        lead to a situation where people in power may break the lawW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 254 of 414with impunity safe in the knowledge that they will not be
             prosecuted as the requisite sanction will not be granted.”

                                               (Emphasis supplied)
300. The decision in this case was a step forward from the general rule laid down

     by the larger Bench inSamsher Singh(supra). However, what is essential

     to note is that the Court did not dilute the general rule laid down earlier, and

     only allowed for a very limited scope of discretion for the Governor in

     certain exceptional situations in light ofArticle 163(2).The extraordinary

     nature of the exceptional situations envisaged by the Court can be gauged

     from the use of the expressions “peril to democracy or democratic

     principles”, “bias is inherent and/or manifest in the advice of the Council of

     Ministers”, “Council of Ministers disables itself or disentitles itself” and

     “there would be a complete breakdown of the rule of law”. Whenever the

     situation arises for the Governor to exercise discretion in discharge of a

     function which is ordinarily to be exercised upon the aid and advice of the

     Council of Ministers, it is these exceptional circumstances that the Governor

     must take into account before rejecting the aid and advice tendered to him.Courts too, when judicially reviewing the exercise of discretion by the

     Governor in such cases, must be guided by the situations as described in the

     decision in M.P. Special Police (supra).Article 200, being a provision

     where the Governor must act on ministerial advice as a general rule, theW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 255 of 414aforesaid exposition would squarely apply to this provision as well, thereby

    severely curtailing any possibility of exercise of discretion by the Governor.
301. Another Constitution Bench of this Court in Nabam Rebia (supra) had the

    occasion to discuss at length the nature of the position of the Governor in

    the constitutional scheme, along with the source and scope of his

    discretionary powers. The Court held that the discretionary powers of the

    Governor could be traced back toArticle 163(1), that is, he could act in

    exercise of his discretionary powers only where expressly provided for

    under the Constitution, or where the interpretation of a constitutional

    provision could not be construed otherwise, or in cases where this Court has

    declared the exercise of powers to be done by the Governor in his discretion

    notwithstanding ministerial advice. Further, the Court held that the finality

    expressed underArticle 163(2)was only in respect of those situations where

    the exercise of discretion by the Governor was permissible under the

    framework ofArticle 163(1)and any exercise of discretion beyond the

    jurisdiction provided by the Constitution would be subject to judicial review.

    The relevant observations are reproduced hereinbelow:
constitutional authority. This position is not acceptable
        because an examination of the executive and legislative
        functions of the Governor, from the surrounding provisions
        of the Constitution clearly brings out that the Governor has
        not been assigned any significant role either in the executive
        or the legislative functioning of the State. The position
        adopted on behalf of the appellants, on the other hand,
        augurs well in an overall harmonious construction of the
        provisions of the Constitution. Even on a cursory
        examination of the relevant provisions of the Constitution, we
        are inclined to accept the contention advanced on behalf of
        the appellants.
149. In our considered view, a clear answer to the query
        raised above, can inter alia emerge from the Constituent
        Assembly Debates with reference to draftArticle 143, which
        eventually came to be renumbered asArticle 163in the
        Constitution. It would be relevant to record that from the
        queries raised by H.V. Kamath, T.T. Krishnamachari, Alladi
        Krishnaswami Ayyar, and from the response to the same by
        Dr B.R. Ambedkar, it clearly emerges that the general
        principle with reference to the scope and extent of the
        discretionary power of the Governor, is provided for throughArticle 163(1).It also becomes apparent fromArticle 163(1),
        which provides for the principle of Ministerial Responsibility.
        The crucial position that gets clarified from a perusal of the
        Constituent Assembly Debates, arises from the answer to the
        query, whether the Governor should have any discretionary
        power at all? The Debates expound, that the retention of
        discretionary power with the Governor was not, in any way,
        contrary to the power of responsible Government, nor should
        the same be assumed as a power akin to that vested with a
        Governor under theGovernment of India Act, 1935. And from
        that, emerges the answer that the retention and vesting of
        discretionary powers with the Governor, should not be taken
        in the sense of being contrary to, or having the effect of
        negating the powers of responsible Government.
Significantly, with reference to the Governor's discretionaryW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 258 of 414powers, it was emphasised by Dr B.R. Ambedkar, that: (CAD
        Vol. 8, p. 501)

             “The Hon'ble Dr B.R. Ambedkar.— … The clause
             is a very limited clause; it says: ‘except insofar as
             he is by or under this Constitution’. Therefore,Article 163will have to be read in conjunction with
             such other articles which specifically reserve the
             power to the Governor. It is not a general clause
             giving the Governor power to disregard the advice
             of his Ministers, in any matter in which he finds he
             ought to disregard. There, I think, lies the fallacy
             of the argument of my Hon'ble friend ….”

        In our considered view, the Constituent Assembly Debates
        leave no room for any doubt that the Framers of the
        Constitution desired to embody the general and basic
        principle, describing the extent and scope of the discretionary
        power of the Governor, in clause (1) ofArticle 163, and not
        in clause (2) thereof, as suggested by the learned counsel for
        the respondents.
xxx          xxx           xxx
154. We are, therefore, of the considered view that insofar as
        the exercise of discretionary powers vested with the
        Governor is concerned, the same is limited to situations,
        wherein a constitutional provision expressly so provides that
        the Governor should act in his own discretion. Additionally,
        a Governor can exercise his functions in his own discretion,
        in situations where an interpretation of the constitutional
        provision concerned, could not be construed otherwise. We,
        therefore, hereby reject the contention advanced on behalf of
        the respondents, that the Governor has the freedom to
        determine when and in which situation, he should take a
        decision in his own discretion, without the aid and advice of
        the Chief Minister and his Council of Ministers. We
        accordingly, also turn down the contention, that wheneverW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 259 of 414the Governor in the discharge of his functions, takes a
        decision in his own discretion, the same would be final and
        binding, and beyond the purview of judicial review. We are
        of the view that finality expressed inArticle 163(2)would
        apply to functions exercised by the Governor in his own
        discretion, as are permissible within the framework ofArticle
        163(1), and additionally, in situations where the clear intent
        underlying a constitutional provision, so requires i.e. where
        the exercise of such power on the aid and advice, would run
        contrary to the constitutional scheme, or would be
        contradictory in terms.
155. We may, therefore, summarise our conclusions as
        under:
Clause (2) ofArticle 254obviates that consequence where
        the law has been reserved for the consideration of the
        President and has received assent.Article 254(1)is made
        subject to clause (2), thereby emphasising that the assent of
        the President will cure a repugnancy of the State law with a
        law enacted by Parliament in a matter falling in the
        Concurrent List. It is in this context, that the decisions of this
        Court hold that the assent of the President should be sought
        in relation to a repugnancy with a specific provision
        contained in a Parliamentary legislation so as to enable due
        consideration by the President of the ground on which assent
        has been sought.Article 200contains the source of the
        constitutional power which is conferred upon the Governor
        to reserve a Bill for the consideration of the President.Article
        254(2)is an illustration of the constitutional authority of the
        Governor to reserve a law enacted by the State Legislature
        for consideration of the President in a specified situation —
        where it is repugnant to an existing law or to a Parliamentary
        legislation on a matter falling in the Concurrent List. The
        eventuality which is specified inArticle 254(2)does not
        exhaust the ambit of the power entrusted to the Governor
        underArticle 200to reserve a Bill for the consideration of
        the President. Apart from a repugnancy in matters falling in
        the Concurrent List between State and Parliamentary
        legislation, a Governor may have sound constitutional
        reasons to reserve a Bill for the consideration of the
        President.Article 200, in its second proviso mandates that a
        Bill which derogates from the powers of the High Court must
        be reserved for the consideration of the President. Apart from
        Bills which fall within the description set out in the second
        proviso, the Governor may legitimately refer a Bill for
        consideration of the President upon entertaining a legitimate
        doubt about the validity of the law. By its very nature, it
        would not be possible for this Court to reflect upon the
        situations in which the power underArticle 200can be
        exercised. This was noticed in the judgment of this Court
        inHoechst [Hoechst Pharmaceuticals Ltd. v. State of Bihar,W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                         Page 266 of 414(1983) 4 SCC 45 : 1983 SCC (Tax) 248] . Excluding it from
            judicial scrutiny, the Court held : (SCC pp. 100-101, para 86)

                 ‘86. [...] There may also be a Bill passed by the
                 State Legislature where there may be a genuine
                 doubt about the applicability of any of the
                 provisions of the Constitution which require the
                 assent of the President to be given to it in order that
                 it may be effective as an Act. In such a case, it is
                 for the Governor to exercise his discretion and to
                 decide whether he should assent to the Bill or
                 should reserve it for consideration of the President
                 to avoid any future complication. Even if it
                 ultimately turns out that there was no necessity for
                 the Governor to have reserved a Bill for the
                 consideration of the President, still he having done
                 so and obtained the assent of the President, the Act
                 so passed cannot be held to be unconstitutional on
                 the ground of want of proper assent. This aspect of
                 the matter, as the law now stands, is not open to
                 scrutiny by the courts. In the instant case, the
                 Finance Bill which ultimately became the Act in
                 question was a consolidating Act relating to
                 different subjects and perhaps the Governor felt
                 that it was necessary to reserve it for the assent of
                 the President. We have no hesitation in holding
                 that the assent of the President is not justiciable,
                 and we cannot spell out any infirmity arising out of
                 his decision to give such assent.’”

                                       (Emphasis supplied)
304. This Court inB.K. Pavitra(supra) took the view that the Constitution has

    entrusted the Governor with the discretion of reserving a bill, presented to

    him for assent, for the consideration of the President. It also held that theW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 267 of 414exercise of the power of reservation of bills for the consideration of the

    President could be done by the Governor contrary to the aid and advice

    tendered by the Council of Ministers. The Court observed that such an

    important responsibility having been conferred upon a constitutional

    functionary, its discharge was expected to be undertaken upon careful

    reflection and with statesmanship, and in a manner that does not thwart

    democratic federalism. On the nature of bills which may be reserved for the

    consideration of the President, the Court held that it was impossible to lay

    down with certainty all the situations wherein such a reference may be

    warranted.

305. We find ourselves in disagreement with the view taken inB.K. Pavitra(supra) that the Constitution confers a discretion upon the Governor insofar

    as the reservation of bills for the consideration of the President is concerned.

    We say so because the removal of the expression “in his discretion” from

    Section 75 of the GoI Act, 1935 when it was being adapted asArticle 200of the Constitution, clearly indicates that any discretion which was available

    to the Governor under the GoI Act, 1935 in respect of reservation of bills

    became unavailable with the commencement of the Constitution. The views

    expressed by the members of the Constituent Assembly, which are recorded

    in the debates that took place onArticle 175of the Draft Constitution, alsoW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 268 of 414indicate the same29. We are also of the view that the same is also in alignment

     with the fundamental tenets of responsible government in a parliamentary

     democracy. The only exception to the general principle of the Governor

     adhering to the aid and advice tendered by the Council of Ministers can be

     traced toArticle 163(1)and the second proviso toArticle 200.
306. Pertinently, the Court inB.K. Pavitra(supra) failed to take into

     consideration the larger Bench decisions inSamsher Singh(supra) and

     M.P. Special Police (supra).As we have discussed above, paragraphs 54 to

     56 of the decision inSamsher Singh(supra) make it clear beyond any doubt

     that there is no express requirement under the Constitution for the exercise

     of discretion by the Governor in discharge of his functions underArticle

     200, except to the limited extent of the second proviso where the expression

     “in his opinion” is employed for the Governor. This is also apparent from

     the conscious decision of the Constituent Assembly in removing the

     expression “in his discretion” while enactingArticle 200.Thus, the only

     express stipulation where the Governor may exercise discretion for

     reservation of bills is in the second proviso toArticle 200.Even when looked

     at from the perspective of necessary implication, the discretion of the

     Governor in reserving the bills for the consideration of the President can be299, CONSTITUENT ASSEMB. DEB. (Aug 1, 1949) 59-62; 10, CONSTITUENT ASSEMB. DEB. (Oct. 17,
1949) 392-394.
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                           Page 269 of 414said to be present only in those cases where the Constitution has envisaged

a mandatory approval of the Government, before the law can become

enforceable in the State. The Sarkaria Commission mentioned three

categories where reservation of a bill for the consideration of the President

is envisaged:
This means that the Governor is made well aware of any legislation that the

     State government is planning to enact much before it is introduced in the

     State legislature and sent to him for assent. Thus, the advisory role of the

     Governor is best played by engaging with the Council of Ministers even

     before the legislation is introduced in the State legislature. He is well within

     his rights, and in fact, it is his bounden duty to put to use his experience and

     wisdom by making constructive suggestions to the Cabinet regarding the

     legislative proposals. The Council of Ministers would also do good to take

     into consideration the advice of the Governor and deliberate upon it so that

     the legislation and ultimately, public interest is benefitted.W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 271 of 414
308. However, once the bill is passed by the State legislature, and presented to

     the Governor for assent, he must act on the aid and advice of the Council of

     Ministers as a general rule and only in exceptional situations which have

     been illustrated in paragraph 300 of this judgment, should he reserve it for

     the consideration of the President. A look at Rule 48 of the Tamil Nadu

     Government Business Rules, 1978 makes it clear that once a draft bill is

     approved by the Minister-in-Charge, a copy of it is supplied to the Governor.

     Rule 48 reads thus:
309. After circulation of the bill to the Governor, any suggestions made by the

     Governor may be looked into and incorporated. Thereafter, a final copy of

     the bill as approved by the Law Department is also circulated to the

     Governor. Rule 51(b) which provides for it reads thus:
310. As our discussion on the Constituent Assembly debates also reveals, the

    option of withholding of assent, was believed by the framers, would be

    invoked in very rare circumstances where the Council of Ministers discover

    some error in the legislation or desire to incorporate certain changes to it so

    as to meet with the popular opinion outside the House. The framers did not

    expect that the Governor would, as a matter of routine, declare the

    withholding of assent to bills casually. The deletion of the expression “in his

    discretion” from the first proviso is also an unmistakable indication of the

    intent of the framers in vesting no discretion in the Governor as regards the

    withholding of assent and returning of the bill along with suggestions for the

    introduction of amendments.

311.B.K. Pavitra(supra) made a reference to paragraph 375 of the decision in

    Nabam Rebia (supra) to support the idea that the Governor is entrusted with

    discretion in the exercise of his powers underArticle 200.However, it is

    pertinent to note that in the said paragraph, the Court observed that “The

    Governor is expected to function in accordance with the provisions of the

    Constitution (and the history behind the enactment of its provisions)”. The

    history behind the enactment ofArticle 200is loud and clear and speaks forW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 273 of 414itself as regards the intention of the framers of the Constitution, as we have

    discussed in detail.

312. What also needs to be remembered is that whenever a provision of the

    Constitution prescribes for the assent of the President for the purpose of

    enforceability or securing immunity, any State government would, in all

    likelihood, advice the Governor to reserve the bill for the consideration of

    the President. Even the Tamil Nadu Government Business Rules, 1978

    prescribe the procedure for pre-consultation with the Central government

    whenever a subject-matter falling in the Concurrent list or certain other

    constitutional provision, is being legislated upon. As we have also discussed,

    the position settled by Kaiser-I-Hind (supra) is that the reference to the

    President needs to be detailed and specific so as to enable him to undertake

    an effective “consideration” of the reserved bill. In the practical working of

    a Cabinet form of government, it is the Council of Ministers who would be

    best equipped to make such detailed references to the President, and the

    Governor would act as the bridge connecting the two. It is only in rare cases,

    where in spite of the evident requirement for the President’s assent in order

    to make the bill effective as an Act (as observed in paragraph 86 of Hoecsht

    (supra)), the Council of Ministers has failed to advice the Governor to

    reserve the bill for the President, should the Governor decide to reserve the

    bill on his own motion.

313. Reference must also be made at this point to the observation made by this

    Court inValluri Basavaiah Chowdhari(supra) wherein it was observed

    thus:
314. As discussed earlier, D.D. Basu has also taken a similar view in his

        commentary on the Constitution of India30. The position prevailing in a

        number of international jurisdictions as discussed in the preceding parts of

        this judgment, also lends credence to this view.

315. The deletion of the expression “in his discretion” both from the substantive

        part ofArticle 200as well as from the first proviso to it signifies that the

        intention of the framers of the Constitution was to ensure that the ordinary

        exercise of the Governor’s function underArticle 200was to be in

        accordance with the aid and advice tendered to him by the Council of

        Ministers. The view expressed by Shri. Brajeshwar Prasad that the Governor

        should be conferred with some veto to negate an unsound legislation was

        expressly rejected by the Constituent Assembly. Further, it was explained

        by Mr. T.T. Krishnamachari that the first proviso was in the form of a saving

        clause where the Council of Ministers could ask the Governor to hold up a

        bill in which certain errors were discovered subsequent to its passage in the

        House(s), or to suitably respond to the popular sentiment expressed after

        such passage. Pertinently, during the course of the debates, it was observed305, DURGA DAS BASU, COMMENTARY ON THE CONSTITUTION OF INDIA 6318 (LexisNexis 2009).W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                         Page 276 of 414by Dr. B. R. Ambedkar that in a responsible form of government, there can

     be no room for the Governor to act in his discretion.

316. The deletion of the words “in his discretion” from Section 75 of the GoI Act,

     1935 before adapting it asArticle 200of the Constitution must be

     understood in the right context. The GoI Act, 1919 introduced an element of

     provincial autonomy in the administration of the country, however, the

     Governor remained at the center of administration having reserve as well as

     emergency powers. With the advent of the GoI Act, 1935, the dyarchy at the

     provincial level was abolished, but the Governor, as the agent of the British

     Crown, continued to have the discretion to veto any legislation passed by

     the provincial legislature. The Governor could also in his discretion reserve

     any bill for the consideration of the Governor-General. This power of the

     Governor was to be essentially exercised in accordance with the directions

     of the Governor-General. However, with the dawn of independence, and the

     framing of the Constitution, the model of governance which was adopted

     allowed the States to be supreme in their respective fields, with certain

     powers having been reserved for the Union to ensure the integrity of the

     nation and uniformity of policy in certain key areas. The Governor was no

     more required to have an all-pervasive control over the State and their

     responsibility towards the Union was to the extent of ensuring that the

     administration in the State was being done in conformity with the principlesW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                     Page 277 of 414enshrined in the Constitution. It is in this context that the power of the

    Governor to submit a report to the President underArticle 356and also the

    power underArticle 200to reserve a bill for the consideration of the

    President, is to be understood.

317. The Governor under the constitutional scheme is no longer envisaged as the

    Governor under the GoI Act, 1935, having the ultimate power to veto any

    legislation and subvert the collective will of the people being expressed

    through the legislature. If the power to withhold assent to bills or to reserve

    them for the consideration of the President is construed as falling within the

    exclusive discretionary domain of the Governor, who would be free to

    decide a course of action notwithstanding the aid and advice of the Council

    of Ministers, it would have the potential of turning him into a super-

    constitutional figure, having the power to bring to a complete halt, the

    operation of the legislative machinery in the State. The Governor cannot be

    vested with such a power, the exercise of which would enable him to collude

    with the Union Cabinet and ensure the death of any and all legislation

    initiated by the State merely by reserving it for the consideration of the

    President, who underArticle 201is not bound to give assent to any

    legislation reserved for his consideration.
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 278 of 414
318. Thus, we are of the view that the Governor does not possess any discretion

    in the exercise of his functions underArticle 200and has to mandatorily

    abide by the advice tendered to him by the Council of Ministers. The only

    exceptions to this general rule are as follows:
319. Exception (a) as mentioned above is one which is expressly provided by the

    Constitution to fall within the ambit of discretionary powers of the

    Governor. Exception (b) flows from a reading of those provisions which

    require the mandatory assent of the President to a bill passed by the State

    legislature and thus are to be construed in light of the observations made in

    Nabam Rebia (supra) as instances “where such intent emerges from aW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 279 of 414legitimate interpretation of the provision concerned, and the same cannot

     be construed otherwise.” Exception (c) has to be construed and understood

     in the context of the observations made by this Court in M.P. Special Police

     (supra) as covering such “situations where by reason of peril to democracy

     or democratic principles, an action may be compelled which from its nature

     is not amenable to Ministerial advice.”



v.    Whether the exercise of discretion by the Governor in discharge of his
      functions underArticle 200of the Constitution could be said to be
      subject to judicial review? If yes, what are the parameters for such
      judicial review?

“Be your ever so high, the law is above you”

                                                          ~ Thomas Fuller
320. We have extensively discussed in the preceding section that the Governor

     under the scheme ofArticle 200would, as a general rule, be expected to act

     on the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers as provided for underArticle 163(1).The deletion of the expression “in his discretion” by the

     framers of the Constitution during the course of adapting Section 75 of the

     GoI Act, 1935 intoArticle 200, is a clear indication of their intent to make

     the ordinary exercise of powers of the Governor underArticle 200subject

     to the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers. However, the aforesaid

     ordinary exercise of power by the Governor is subject to certain exceptionsW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                     Page 280 of 414where the Governor may act in his own discretion, contrary to the advice of

the Council of Ministers. There are two broad circumstances under which it

would be permissible for the Governor to act in his own discretion underArticle 200:
321. The question which naturally follows is whether the exercise of discretion

    by the Governor, in the exceptional situations as discussed aforesaid, would

    be amenable to judicial review. The importance of this question lies in the

    high constitutional importance of the role which the Governor plays underArticle 200.The Governor, by choosing to act in his discretion underArticle

    200, has the power to thwart the entire legislative machinery of the State by

    reserving a bill for the consideration of the President. He also has the power

    to significantly delay the grant of assent to a bill by withholding assent and

    returning the same to the State legislature under the first proviso toArticle

    200of the Constitution.

322. It was contended by the petitioner that no exercise of power under the

    Constitution could be said to be beyond the scope of judicial review as every

    authority, howsoever high, is expected to perform its functions within the

    constitutional framework. It was submitted that if the exercise of powers by

    the Governor underArticle 200is held to be outside the scope of judicialW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 282 of 414review, then that would render him to be a super-constitutional figure in the

     State, who would be able to override the legislature and the government

     elected by the people, at his whims and fancies and without any checks and

     balance.

323. Refuting the contention of the petitioner, the Attorney General for India

     placed reliance on the decisions of this Court inHoechst(supra), Kaiser-I-

     Hind (supra), andB.K. Pavitra(supra) to argue that the grant of assent

     underArticles 200and201respectively has been previously held to be non-

     justiciable by this Court.

324. Essentially, the questions that fall for our consideration are as follows:
(ii) Secondly, whether the withholding of assent by the President underArticle 201of the Constitution, could also be said to be beyond the

           scope of judicial scrutiny?
(iii) Thirdly, if the aforesaid discharge of functions is subject to judicial

           review, whether such discharge of functions could be said to be non-

           justiciable in light of the decisions of this Court inHoechst(supra),

           Kaiser-I-Hind (supra), andB.K. Pavitra(supra)?
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 283 of 414
325.Samsher Singh(supra) in paragraph 54 observed that “The discretion

    conferred upon the Governor means that as the constitutional or formal

    head of the State the power is vested in him”. We have also discussed in

    detail, in the preceding sections, that the source of all discretion for the

    Governor is to be found withinArticle 163(1)of the Constitution alone.

    Thus, what falls for us to decide is whether the exercise of this constitutional

    power by the Governor could be said to be amenable to judicial review

    where such exercise is assailed on the ground that it transgresses the

    boundaries set by the Constitution. This Court has had the occasion of

    discussing the concept of judicial review in a catena of cases. We are of the

    view that for a better exposition and enlightenment on this issue, it would be

    prudent and beneficial to make a reference to all these decisions.
326.InMaru Ram(supra) this Court speaking eruditely through the inimitable

    Krishna Iyer, J., observed that all public power including constitutional

    powers of pardon, commutation and release underArticles 72and161of the

    Constitution respectively, cannot run riot or be exercisable irrationally or

    arbitrarily. Any action under these provisions must be informed by the finer

    canons of constitutionalism. In his words, “the rule of law, under our

    constitutional order, transforms all public power into responsible,

    responsive, regulated exercise informed by high purposes and geared toW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 284 of 414people’s welfare”. It held that all the powers entrusted by the Constitution

must, in its exercise, eschew any form of arbitrariness and stem from an

intelligible and well-reasoned criterion that is predicated on an earnest

purpose. It further categorically held that – “while constitutional power is

beyond challenge, its actual exercise may still be vulnerable” – to judicial

review. In the last, Krishna Iyer, J., further cautioned that such power ought

not to be vulgarized or abused by personal vanity and the notions of those

exercising such powers. The relevant observations read as under:
327. This Court, speaking through nine-Judges inIndra Sawhney v. Union of

    Indiareported in (1992) Supp (3) SCC 217 held that the yardstick of

    subjecting an act or a decision to judicial review is not whether it is a

    legislative act or an executive decision on a policy matter but whether it

    violates any constitutional guarantee or the rights under Part III of the

    Constitution. TheCourt further heldthat the doctrine of political thicket does

    not apply in the Indian constitutional framework. It is not that the courts

    avoid entering into a political question because of the doctrine of separation

    of power, but because of desirability of avoiding entering into a political

    question. The relevant observations are reproduced hereinbelow:
328. Further, this Court inB.P. Singhal(supra) upon examining a catena of

    decisions on the scope and evolution of the power of judicial review of the

    courts observed that, although under the English Law, the prerogative

    powers of the monarch such as the power to make treaties, grant mercy or

    to dissolve the parliament etc. are traditionally not subject to judicial review

    due to the very nature of such powers falling outside the expertise and

    competence of the courts, yet such preclusion of the power of judicial review

    is by no means a blanket rule. It observed that even prerogative powers,

    insofar as the questions of legality, rationality or procedural propriety are

    concerned, would always be amenable to judicial review, because the

    safeguarding of such considerations in the exercise of any prerogative

    powers is the domain, responsibility and duty of the courts as the sentinel on

    the qui vive.Placing reliance on the decision of this Court inState of

    Rajasthan v. Union of Indiareported in (1977) 3 SCC 592 it held that theW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 288 of 414courts, as the protector and ultimate interpreter of the Constitution, not only

have the power but an obligation to determine the power conferred on each

branch of the government, the extent and limits of such powers and whether

the exercise of such power exceeds those limits or not, irrespective of

whether such powers are the exclusive prerogative of any one branch of the

government or such questions are inherently political in complexion. The

relevant observations read as under:
329.Furthermore, B.P. Singhal(supra) categorically held that unlike England,

    all powers that have been conferred upon the President and the Governor by

    the Constitution are not a matter of prerogative but a constitutionalW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 291 of 414responsibility and its exercise, a matter of performance of an official duty of

the highest sanctity, and thus, unquestionably amenable to judicial review.

It observed that the sufficiency of the attending facts and circumstances

necessitating the exercise of such powers is to be decided by the President

or the Governor. However, the question of whether such exercise is

predicated upon all relevant cogent materials and falls within the limitations

of the constitutional scheme and is not a result of an arbitrary or malafide

exercise, would be subject to the judicial review of the courts.Placing

reliance onMaru Ram(supra) it held that the exercise of such powers by

the President only carries with it a notional presumption of a careful and

proper exercise based on objective considerations, but, by no stretch of

imagination can it be construed to confer an immunity from judicial review.

It further explained, in the context ofArticle 72of the Constitution, the

standard of judicial review that the courts are expected to apply when

scrutinizing the exercise of such power by the President. It held that where

reasons have been given for the exercise of such power, there the courts may

interfere only if the reasons are based on irrelevant or extraneous

considerations. However, where no reasons have been given, there the courts

may interfere only if the exercise is vitiated by a flawed understanding of

the ambit of such power by misjudgment or is otherwise arbitrary,

discriminatory or malafide. The relevant observations read as under: -W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 292 of 414
330.InKeisham(supra), this Court had held that a Speaker acting under the

    Tenth Schedule of the Constitution would be duty bound to decide theW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 293 of 414disqualification petitions made before him within a reasonable time and that

    any failure in exercising this jurisdiction conferred upon him or reluctancy

    in acting in a time-bound manner would be a fit ground for the courts to

    engage in an exercise of judicial review of his actions, irrespective of the

    fact that it is the Speaker who has the prerogative to adjudicate such

    petitions. It held that even where the jurisdiction of the courts to embark

    upon an examination on the merits of such prerogative powers has been

    ousted, the same does not curtail or inhibit the power of judicial review over

    the manner of exercise or non-exercise of such prerogative powers.
331. Similarly, in A.G. Perarivalan (supra), this Court reiterated that any

    inexplicable or inexcusable non-exercise of a prerogative or sovereign

    power would be amenable to judicial review and that the manner of exercise

    of such powers by the Governor could not be said to be impervious to

    judicial scrutiny.

332. From the above exposition of law, it becomes clear as a noon day, that no

    exercise of power under the Constitution is beyond the pale of judicial

    review. Thus, we find no reason to exclude the discharge of functions by the

    Governor or the President underArticles 200and201of the Constitution

    respectively.
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 294 of 414
333. It could be argued that the decision taken by the Governor underArticle 200would be shielded from the scrutiny of the courts by virtue of the immunity

     accorded underArticle 361of the Constitution. However, in this regard, we

     may only refer to the observations made by this Court inRameshwar Prasad(supra) which leaves no doubt that the immunity enshrined inArticle 361of

     the Constitution does not preclude or prohibit the courts in any manner from

     looking into the actions of the Governor which by necessary implication

     would include his actions underArticle 200as well. The relevant

     observations are as follows:
334. The High Court of Madras inS. Ramakrishnan v. State of Tamil Nadureported in 2020 SCC OnLine Mad 5207 was in seisin of a similar issue

    involving a bill passed by the State Legislative Assembly which remained

    pending for two months before the Governor for grant of assent. When the

    High Court posed a question as regards the inaction on the part of the

    Governor, the Advocate General referred toArticle 361of the Constitution.

    The Court interpretedArticle 361in light ofArticle 200and observed that

    the protection granted to the Governor under the Constitution was to perform

    his constitutional duties expeditiously. It also underscored the obligation of

    the courts to perform their constitutional duties and subjecting

    unconstitutional actions to judicial scrutiny in public interest. The relevant

    observations are as follows:
When public interest requires, this Court has to do its
            constitutional duties and to address the situation. However,
            this Court is of the opinion that such a situation would not
            arise to pass any order in this matter.”
                                             (Emphasis supplied)W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 296 of 414
335. Thus, what is discernible from above is that the discharge of functions by

     the President or the Governor as constitutional and formal heads is

     undoubtedly subject to judicial review by virtue of it being an exercise of

     their constitutional powers. However, could it at the same time be said that

     nevertheless it would be improper for the courts to examine such actions of

     the President or the Governor as the actions are essentially political in nature

     and hence non-justiciable for the reason that no judicial standard can be

     evolved for the scrutiny of such actions. In this regard, we may make

     reference to certain decisions rendered by this Court as well as few landmark

     decisions of other international jurisdictions.

336.InMinerva Mills v. Union of Indiareported in (1980) 3 SCC 625, this Court

     held that the jurisdiction of courts is not ousted merely because a question

     has a political colour. Every constitutional question, irrespective of the

     political complexion or make thereof, falls within the jurisdiction of the

     courts. The Court held that whether the legislature or the executive has acted

     within the limits of its authority or not, is for the courts to decide. The

     relevant observations are as follows:
337. The nine-Judge Bench decision of this Court inS.R. Bommai(supra)

    observed that the concept of justiciability is not synonymous with judicial

    review. It noted that even while exercising the power of judicial review,

    courts can decline to exercise such power as being non-justiciable. It

    categorically observed that though judicial review may be avoided on

    questions of political nature, yet legal questions camouflaged with a political

    cloak will be justiciable. The relevant observations have been reproduced

    hereinbelow:
The courts must have judicially manageable standards toW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 299 of 414decide a particular controversy. Justiciability on a subjective
            satisfaction conferred in the widest terms to the political
            coordinate executive branch created by the constitutional
            scheme itself is one of the considerations to be kept in view in
            exercising judicial review [...]”
                                              (Emphasis supplied)
338. This Court inA.K. Kaul v. Union of Indiareported in (1995) 4 SCC 73 also

    elucidated the distinction between judicial review and justiciability. It

    observed that, in a written Constitution, the bounds within which the various

    organs of the State are delineated, the same implicitly casts a duty upon the

    courts to test the validity of every action of such constitutional organ,

    through judicial review, to ensure that such exercise of power is within the

    confines of the Constitution. It thus, held that the power of judicial review

    of the courts would be available in respect of exercise of all powers by any

    authority under the Constitution unless expressly excluded. It further held

    that, although judicial review is the norm, yet the unavailability of judicially

    manageable standards in certain aspects of the power, whose exercise is in

    question, may render the judicial review of such exercise of power non-

    justiciable. It explained that justiciability refers to the question whether a

    particular field could be said to fall within the purview of the power of

    judicial review. The relevant observations are as follows:
339. This Court inEpuru Sudhakar v. Govt. of A.P.reported in (2006) 8 SCC

    161, speaking in the context ofArticles 72and161of the Constitution

    respectively, observed that the determining factor in deciding whether a

    sovereign or prerogative power would be subject to judicial review is the

    subject-matter of such power and not its source. It held that the exercise of

    every prerogative power is subject to the rule of law and the rule of lawW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 301 of 414cannot be made subservient to political expediency. The Court defined that

‘manageable standards’ refer to certain discernible standards expected in a

functioning democracy. It also held that exercise of any prerogative power

cannot be placed in a straitjacket formula and manageable standards would

vary depending on the nature of the power. The relevant observations are as

follows:
However, when the impugned decision does not indicate any
            data or manageable standards, the decision amounts to
            derogation of an important constitutional principle of Rule of
            Law.”

340. In Regina (Miller) v. Prime Minister (Lord Advocate and others

    intervening) reported in [2019] 3 WLR 589, the Supreme Court of the

    United Kingdom was dealing with the justiciability of the power of

    prorogation. It was held that, although the courts cannot decide political

    questions, yet, the fact that a dispute arises from a matter of political

    controversy would not restrain the courts completely from looking into it, in

    exercise of judicial review. It further noted that almost all decisions by the

    executive have a political hue to them, yet, the courts in the past haveW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 303 of 414exercised a supervisory jurisdiction. The Court held that a threat to

    parliamentary sovereignty constitutes as a significant ground for

    justiciability of prerogative powers.

341. In the seminal decision of Baker v. Carr, reported in 1962 SCC OnLine US

    SC 40, the Supreme Court of the United States of America examined

    whether questions of legislative apportionment were essentially political

    questions and hence, not justiciable. The Court in this case laid down six

    heavily overlapping indicia of a non-justiciable matter. These were as

    follows: (i) a textually demonstrable constitutional commitment of the issue

    to another political branch; or (ii) a lack of judicially discoverable and

    manageable standards for resolving it, or (iii) a need to make an initial policy

    determination clearly for non-judicial discretion, or (iv) the impossibility of

    a decision by the court without expressing lack of respect due to co-ordinate

    branches of Government; or (v) an unusual need for unquestioning

    adherence to a political decision already made; or (vi) the potentiality for

    embarrassment from multifarious pronouncements by various departments

    on one question. It was emphatically held that, save the aforesaid

    considerations, no other issue is liable for dismissal on ground of a lack of

    justiciability.

     decisions of this Court where the justiciability of assent has been discussed.

     The first in line is the Constitution Bench decision inKameshwar Singh(supra) where M.C. Mahajan, J., (as his lordship then was), in the context ofArticle 31Aof the Constitution, observed that the assent of the President,

     once given to a bill reserved for his consideration, is non-justiciable. The

     relevant observations are as follows:
343. The aforesaid observations would indicate that the grant of assent by the

     President to a State legislation falling underArticle 31Awas held to be non-

     justiciable only on the ground that the first proviso toArticle 31Aconfers

     the power on the President to take a decision as regards whether assent is to

     be granted or not.
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 305 of 414
344. The next decision where the justiciability of assent was discussed is the

    decision of the three-Judge Bench inHoechst(supra) wherein, inter alia,

    one of the grounds of challenge to the legislation under consideration was

    that since the subject matter of the bill fell under List II of the Seventh

    Schedule, there was no occasion for the Governor to have reserved the bill

    for the consideration of the President. It is on this ground that the subsequent

    grant of assent by the President was called into question. Negativing the

    contention, the Court observed thus:
345. It is important to note that the aforesaid observations were made by this

    Court in response to the argument that the grant of assent by the President,

    in a case where it was not necessary for the Governor to reserve the bill for

    the consideration of the President, would vitiate the assent given by the

    President. On the contrary, the case at hand involves a totally different

    factual situation wherein the State Government is aggrieved by the

    reservation of bills by the Governor in exercise of his discretion and not in

    accordance with the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers. The further

    grievance of the petitioner is that such reservation of bills by the Governor

    is not guided by constitutional principles but is impelled by lack of bonafides

    and political reasons. The applicability of theratiolaid down inthe aforesaid

    decisions ofKameshwar Singh(supra) andHoechst(supra) and also the

    other decisions of this Court as regards the questions of justiciability and

    judicial review, would have to be decided keeping in mind the peculiar facts

    of the case at hand which we have been called upon to deal with.W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 307 of 414
346. The decision inHoechst(supra) was referred to in the decision of this Court

     inBharat Sevashram Sangh v. State of Gujaratreported in (1986) 4 SCC

     51 wherein one of the challenges to the validity of the legislation was that

     the bill had received conditional assent from the President, and such partial

     or conditional assent not being permissible under the Constitution, was thus

     erroneous in law.While the Court referred to the observations made inHoechst(supra), it also looked into the materials on record and arrived at a

     conclusion that there was no infirmity in the grant of assent by the President.

     Therefore, it cannot be said that the decision of the Court was based on the

     non-justiciability of assent alone as the Court arrived at the finding after the

     actual satisfaction on the validity of assent upon a perusal of the relevant

     materials. The relevant observations are reproduced below:
In reply to these averments in the petitions the Under
        Secretary to the Government of Gujarat, Education
        Department has stated in his counter-affidavit that the Bill
        was presented to the Governor of Gujarat after it was passed
        by the Assembly. The Governor of Gujarat reserved the Bill
        for the consideration of the President underArticle 200of the
        Constitution since he felt that in view of clause 33 of the Bill
        which provided for taking over of the management of a school
        for a limited period in public interest it was necessary to
        reserve the Bill for the consideration of the President.
        Accordingly the Bill was referred to the President. At the
        meeting held in the Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of
        India on August 3, 1973 to discuss the Bill it was suggested
        by the representatives of the Central Government that the
        provisions of the Bill which did not exclude institutions
        established or administered by the minorities from their
        scope were repugnant toArticle 30of the Constitution and
        therefore the Bill should be suitably amended. It was also
        suggested to the representatives of the State Government that
        it would be better to carry out the requisite amendments by
        promulgating an ordinance. Accordingly the draft of the
        ordinance which was ultimately promulgated as Ordinance 6
        of 1973 was forwarded for the instructions of the President
        underArticle 213(1)of the Constitution. Thereafter the draft
        of the Ordinance and the Bill were both considered by the
        President and he assented to the said Bill and issued
        instructions as required by the proviso toArticle 213of the
        Constitution for the promulgation of the said Ordinance on
        September 28, 1973. Accordingly the said Bill became law on
        its publication on the very same day. The Ordinance was
        issued on September 29, 1973. In the circumstances it cannot
        be said that the assent which was given by the President was
        conditional. The records relating to the above proceedings
        were also made available to the court. On going through the
        material placed before us we are satisfied that the President
        had given assent to the Act and it is not correct to say that it
        was a qualified assent.The Actwhich was duly published inW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 309 of 414the official Gazette contains the recital that the said Act had
            received the assent of the President on September 28, 1973.
            Moreover questions relating to the fact whether assent is
            given by the Governor or the President cannot be agitated
            also in this manner. [...]”
                                              (Emphasis supplied)
347.Hoechst(supra) was also referred to and relied upon by this Court inB.K.

    Pavitra(supra) wherein it was observed that owing to the sovereign nature

    of the power of the Governor to reserve a bill for the consideration of the

    President underArticle 200, it would not be possible for this Court to reflect

    upon the situations in which such a power of reference may be exercised by

    the Governor.It was further observed by the Court that the decision inHoechst(supra) has excluded the exercise of this power from the scope of

    judicial scrutiny. The relevant observations read as under: -
justiciable.Hoechst [Hoechst Pharmaceuticals Ltd. v. State
            of Bihar, (1983) 4 SCC 45 : 1983 SCC (Tax) 248] also lays
            down that even if, as it turns out, it was not necessary for the
            Governor to reserve a Bill for the consideration of the
            President, yet if it was reserved for and received the assent of
            the President, the law as enacted cannot be regarded as
            unconstitutional for want of “proper” assent.

73. The above decisions essentially answer the submissions
            which were urged by Dr Dhavan. The law as propounded in
            the line of precedents adverted to above must negate the
            submissions which were urged on behalf of the petitioners.
            Once the Bill (which led to the Reservation Act, 2018) was
            reserved by the Governor for the consideration of the
            President, it was for the President to either grant or withhold
            assent to the Bill. The President having assented to the Bill,
            the requirements ofArticle 201were fulfilled. The validity of
            the assent by the President is non-justiciable. [...]”

                                              (Emphasis supplied)
348. We find it difficult to express our agreement with the view taken inB.K.

    Pavitra(supra) that the exercise of power to reserve a bill for the

    consideration of the President by the Governor is beyond the pale of judicial

    scrutiny, even in cases where it is exercised in his own discretion and againstW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 311 of 414the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers. We have discussed in the

previous sections of this judgment that the Governor underArticle 200is

ordinarily expected to act in accordance with the aid and advice of the

Council of Ministers, and it is only in certain very exceptional situations that

he should resort to the exercise of discretion. Further, the limits of such

discretion are to be derived fromArticle 163(1).The exercise of such

discretion by the Governor, if excluded from judicial scrutiny, would

militate against the fundamental constitutional principle that exercise of all

power must be within the confines of the Constitution. Absolute exclusion

of judicial scrutiny would also confer upon the Governor an absolute power

to disregard the will of the people expressed through the State legislature

and government. While it is true that there may be situations in which the

exercise of discretion by the Governor underArticle 200would be

permissible, this does not imply that this Court would be precluded from

determining the legality and propriety of the exercise of such discretion in a

given case. In fact, it is owing to the impossibility of the task of exhaustively

charting out such situations wherein discretion would be allowed to be

exercised, that it becomes all the more crucial for the power of judicial

review to exist with the courts. This would keep in line any bonafide action

on the part of the Governor which is disguised under the garb of legitimate

exercise of discretion.
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 312 of 414
349. The two-fold observations inB.K. Pavitra(supra) vesting the Governor with

     unfettered discretion to reserve bills for the consideration of the President

     underArticle 200, and at the same time excluding such exercise of discretion

     from judicial scrutiny essentially has the effect of safeguarding the actions

     of the Governor in a lead casket which cannot be permeated even in cases

     of breach of the constitutional framework within which the Governor is

     expected to function.

350. The Constitution Bench in Kaiser-I-Hind (supra) had the occasion to

     consider in detail whether the assent of the President sought with regard to

     a State law would be limited only to the repugnancy of the laws to which the

     attention of the President was drawn to whilst seeking his assent or would

     such assent be qua all other laws enacted by the Parliament to which the

     State law in question may also be repugnant to. In other words, whether the

     assent granted by the President to a State legislation would be deemed to be

     an assent qua all earlier enactments made by the Parliament on the subject.

     This Court whilst answering the aforesaid question in the negative, held that

     the “consideration” by the President and his “assent” underArticle 254(2)is limited to the proposal made by the State government and, the State

     legislation would prevail only qua the laws for which repugnancy was

     pointed out and the “assent” of the President was sought for. The Court,

     inter alia, held that the words “reserved for consideration” indicate theW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                     Page 313 of 414requirement of an active application of mind by the President to the

     repugnancy pointed out between the proposed State law and the earlier law

     made by the Parliament and the necessity of having such a law in the State,

     keeping in mind the peculiar facts, the attending circumstances and the

     backdrop in which such law was made by the State government. Similarly,

     the word “consideration” indicates the requirement of careful thinking and

     due application of mind regarding the necessity of having a State law which

     is repugnant to the law(s) made by the Parliament. Lastly, the term “assent”

     implies an expressed agreement of mind to what is proposed by the State

     i.e., knowledge of the President as to the repugnancy between the State law

     and the earlier law(s) made by Parliament on the same subject-matter, as

     well as agreement to the reason and attending circumstances, regarding the

     necessity of having such State law.

351. As regards justiciability, it was held by the Court that the examination of the

     records to ascertain the extent to which assent was sought for, would not

     amount to deciding whether assent was rightly or wrongly given. Thus, it

     could not be said that the Court was determining the validity of the assent

     granted by the President. The relevant observations made by M.B., Shah J.,,

     speaking for the majority, are reproduced below:
352. Doraiswamy Raju, J., in a concurring opinion, laid strong emphasis on the

    requirement that a reference to the President for the purpose ofArticle

    254(2)must be precise and specific as regards the extent of protection sought

    for the State legislation. He observed that keeping in mind the seriousW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 315 of 414implications of the grant of assent of the President to a repugnant State law,

the making of such reference to the President cannot be exercised in a routine

manner. He further observed that the non-justiciability of the assent of the

President would not preclude the constitutional courts from examining the

sufficiency and justifiability of the predominance sought for the State

legislation over the Central legislation. The relevant observations are

reproduced below:
Necessarily, in the quasi-federal structure adopted for the
        nation, predominance is given to the law made by Parliament
        and in such circumstances only the State law which secured
        the assent of the President under clause (2) ofArticle 254comes to be protected, subject of course to the powers of
        Parliament under the proviso to the said clause. Therefore,
        the President has to be apprised of the reasons at least as to
        why his assent is being sought, the need or necessity and the
        justification or otherwise for claiming predominance for the
        State law concerned. This itself would postulate an
        obligation, inherent in the scheme underlying as well as the
        very purpose and object of seeking the assent under clause
        (2) ofArticle 254, to enumerate or specify and illustrate the
        particular Central law or provision with reference to which
        the predominance is desired. The absence of any
        standardized or stipulated form in which it is to be sought for,W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 317 of 414should not detract the State concerned, to disown its
        obligation to be precise and specific in the extent of
        protection sought having regard to the serious consequences
        which thereby inevitably follow i.e. the substitution of the
        Union law in force by the State law, in the territorial limits of
        the State concerned, with drastic alteration or change in the
        rights of citizen, which it may, thereby bring about.
74. The mere forwarding of a copy of the Bill may obviate, if
        at all, only the need to refer to each one of the provisions
        therein in detail in the requisition sent or the letter
        forwarding it, but not obliterate the necessity to point out
        specifically the particular Central law or provisions with
        reference to which, the predominance is claimed or
        purported to be claimed. The deliberate use of the word
        “consideration” in clause (2) ofArticle 254, in my view, not
        only connotes that there should be an active application of
        mind, but also postulates a deliberate and careful thought
        process before taking a decision to accord or not to accord
        the assent sought for. If the object of referring the State law
        for consideration is to have the repugnancy resolved by
        securing predominance to the State law, the President has to
        necessarily consider the nature and extent of repugnancy, the
        feasibility, practicalities and desirabilities involved therein,
        though may not be obliged to write a judgment in the same
        manner, the courts of law do, before arriving at a conclusion
        to grant or refuse to grant or even grant partially, if the
        repugnancy is with reference to more than one law in force
        made by Parliament. Protection cannot be claimed for the
        State law, when questioned before courts, taking cover under
        the assent, merely asserting that it was in general form,
        irrespective of the actual fact whether the State claimed for
        such protection against a specific law or the attention of the
        President was invited to at least an apprehended repugnancy
        vis-à-vis the particular Central law. In the teeth of
        innumerable Central laws enacted and in force on concurrent
        subjects enumerated in List III of the Seventh Schedule to theW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 318 of 414Constitution, and the hoard of provisions contained therein,
        artificial assumptions based on some supposed knowledge of
        all those provisions and the presumed regularity of official
        acts, cannot be blown out of proportion, to do away with an
        essential exercise, to make the “assent” meaningful, as if they
        are empty formalities, except at the risk of renderingArticle
        254itself a dead letter or merely otiose. The significant and
        serious alteration in or modification of the rights of parties,
        both individuals or institutions resulting from the “assent”
        cannot be overlooked or lightly brushed aside as of no
        significance, whatsoever. In a federal structure, peculiar to
        the one adopted by our Constitution it would become
        necessary for the President to be apprised of the reason as to
        why and for what special reason or object and purpose,
        predominance for the State law over the Central law is
        sought, deviating from the law in force made by Parliament
        for the entire country, including that part of the State. When
        this Court observed inGram Panchayat of Village Jamalpur
        v. Malwinder Singh[(1985) 3 SCC 661] that when the assent
        of the President is sought for a specific purpose the efficacy
        of the assent would be limited to that purpose and cannot be
        extended beyond it, and that if the assent is sought and given
        in general terms so as to be effective for all purposes different
        considerations may legitimately arise, it cannot legitimately
        be contended that this Court had also declared that
        reservation of the State law can also be by mere reference toArticle 254(2)alone with no further disclosures to be made
        or that with mere forwarding of the Bill, no other information
        or detail was either a permissible or legalized and approved
        course to be adopted or that such course was held to be
        sufficient, by this Court, to serve the purpose of the said
        article. The expression “general terms” needs to be
        understood, in my view, a reference to a particular law as a
        whole in contrast to any one particular or individual in the
        said law and not that, it can be even without any reference
        whatsoever. The further observation therein, (SCC p. 669,
        para 12)W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 319 of 414“not only was the President not apprised in the
             instant case that his assent was sought because of
             the repugnancy between the State Act and the pre-
existing Central Act on the vesting of evacuee
             properties but, his assent was sought for a
             different, specific purpose altogether”,

        would belie any such claim. Per contra, it would only
        reinforce the principle that the consideration as well as the
        decision to accord consent should be a conscious one, after
        due application of mind, relevant and necessary for the
        purpose. Though, submission of a thesis on the various
        aspects of repugnancy involved may not be the requirement,
        the reservation for “consideration” would necessarily
        obligate an invitation of the attention of the President as to
        which of the pre-existing Central enactments or which
        provisions of those enactments are considered or
        apprehended to be repugnant, with reference to which the
        assent envisaged inArticle 254(2)is sought for. This becomes
        all the more necessary also for the reason that the
        repugnancy in respect of which predominance is sought to be
        secured must be shown to exist or apprehended, on the date
        of the State law and not in a vacuum to cure any and every
        possible repugnancy in respect of all laws — irrespective of
        whether it was in the contemplation or not of the seeker of the
        assent or of the President at the time of “consideration” for
        according assent.
75. This Court has, no doubt, held that the assent accorded
        by the President is not justiciable, and courts cannot spell out
        any infirmity in the decision arrived at, to give the assent.
        Similarly, when the President was found to have accorded
        assent and the same was duly published, it cannot be
        contended that the assent was not really that of the President,
        as claimed. It is also not given to anyone to challenge the
        decision of the President according assent, on merits and as
        to its legality, propriety or desirability. But that is not theW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 320 of 414same thing as approving an attempt to draw a blanket or veil
        so as to preclude an examination by this Court or the High
        Court as to the justifiability and sufficiency or otherwise of
        the protection or predominance claimed for the State law
        over the law made by Parliament or the existing law, based
        upon the assent accorded, resulting at times in substantial
        alteration, change or modification in the rights and
        obligations of citizen, including the fundamental rights.
        When the Constitution extends a form of protection to a
        repugnant State law, permitting predominance and also to
        hold the field in the place of the law made by the Centre,
        conditioned upon the reservation of the State law for
        consideration of the President and obtaining his assent, it is
        to be necessarily viewed as an essential prerequisite to be
        effectively and meticulously fulfilled before ever availing of
        the protection and the same cannot be viewed merely as a
        ceremonial ritual. If such a vitally essential procedure and
        safeguard is to be merely viewed as a routine formality which
        can be observed in whatever manner desired by those
        concerned and that it would be merely enough, if the assent
        has been secured howsoever obtained, it would amount to
        belittling its very importance in the context of distribution of
        legislative powers and the absolute necessity to preserve the
        supremacy of Parliament to enact a law on a concurrent topic
        in List III, for the entire country. It would also amount to
        acceptance of even a farce of compliance to be actual or real
        compliance. Such a course could not be adopted by courts
        except by doing violence to the language, as well as the
        scheme, and the very object underlyingArticle 254(2).
76. Different provisions of the Constitution envisage the
        grant of assent by the President as well as the Governor of a
        State.Article 111provides for the assent of the President to
        a Bill passed by the Houses of Parliament, in the same
        manner in whichArticle 200empowers the Governor of a
        State in respect of a Bill passed by the Legislative Assembly
        or by the Houses of the legislature where there is aW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 321 of 414Legislative Council in addition to the Assembly. Parliament
        for the Union consists of the President and two Houses as the
        legislature of States consists of the Governor and the House
        or Houses, as the case may be (videArticles 79and168). The
        policy-making executive power of the Union also vests with
        the President, as the executive power of the State vests with
        the Governor, and those powers have to be exercised with the
        aid and advice of the Council of Ministers, for the Union
        headed by the Prime Minister and for the State to be headed
        by the Chief Minister. The President or the Governor, as the
        case may be, as and when a Bill after having been passed is
        presented, may accord assent or as soon as possible
        thereafter return the Bill to the Houses with a message
        requesting to reconsider the Bill or any provisions thereof,
        including the introduction of any amendment as
        recommended in his message and if thereafter the Houses on
        reconsideration of the Bill, pass the Bill again with or without
        amendment and present the same for the assent, the
        President/Governor, as the case may be, shall not withhold
        his assent. Being an exercise pertaining to expression of
        political will, apparently, the will of the people expressed
        through the legislation passed by their elected
        representatives is given prominence by specifically providing
        for a compulsory consent or assent. The same could not be
        said with reference to the “assent” of the President envisaged
        underArticles 31-A, 31-C, 254(2)and304(b)of the
        Constitution. In my view, the “assent” envisaged in these
        articles by the very nature and character of the powers
        conferred constitute a distinct class and category of their
        own, different from the normal “assent” envisaged underArticles 111of the President orArticle 200of the Governor.Article 201also would indicate that even when for the second
        time the Houses of the State Legislature pass the Bill and
        present for “consideration”, there is no compulsion for the
        President to accord assent. Therefore, the reservation of any
        Bill/Act for the “consideration” of the President for
        according his assent, keeping in view, also the avowed objectW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 322 of 414envisaged underArticle 254(2), renders it qualitatively
        different from the ordinary assent to be given by the President
        to a Bill passed by Parliament or that of the Governor to a
        Bill passed by the legislature(s) of the State concerned.
77. The assent of the President or the Governor, as the case
        may be, is considered to be part of the legislative process only
        for the limited purpose that the legislative process is
        incomplete without them for enacting a law and in the
        absence of the assent the Bill passed could not be considered
        to be an Act or a piece of legislation, effective and
        enforceable and not to extend the immunity in respect of
        procedural formalities to be observed inside the respective
        Houses and certification by the presiding officer concerned
        of their due compliance, to areas or acts outside and besides
        those formalities. The powers actually exercised by the
        President, at any rate underArticles 31-A, 31-C, 254(2)and304(b)are a special constituent power vested with the Head
        of the Union, as the protector and defender of the
        Constitution and safety valve to safeguard the fundamental
        rights of citizens and federal structure of the country's polity
        as adopted in the Constitution. A genuine, real and effective
        consideration would depend upon specific and sufficient
        information being provided to him inviting, at any rate, his
        attention to the Central law with which the State law is
        considered or apprehended to be repugnant, and in the
        absence of any effort or exercise shown to have been
        undertaken, when questioned before courts, the State law
        cannot be permitted or allowed to have predominance or an
        overriding effect over that Central enactment of Parliament
        to which no specific reference of the President at all has been
        invited to. This, in my view, is a must and an essential
        requirement to be satisfied; in the absence of which the
        “consideration” claimed would be one in a vacuum and
        really oblivious to the hoard of legislations falling under the
        Concurrent List in force in the country and enacted by
        Parliament. To uphold as valid the claim for any such blanketW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 323 of 414assent or all-round predominance over any and every such
             law — whether brought to the notice of the President or not,
             would amount to legitimization of what was not even in the
             contemplation or consideration on the basis of some assumed
             “consideration”. In order to find out the real state of affairs
             as to whether the “assent” in a given case was after a due
             and proper application of mind and effective
             “consideration” as envisaged by the Constitution, this Court
             as well as the High Court exercising powers of judicial
             review are entitled to call for the relevant records and look
             into the same. This the courts have been doing, as and when
             considered necessary, all along. No exception therefore
             could be taken to the High Court in this case adopting such a
             procedure, in discharge of its obligations and exercise of
             jurisdiction under the Constitution of India.”

                                              (Emphasis supplied)
353. It is pertinent to note that it was observed by Doraiswamy, J., that the assent

     of the President underArticle 254(2)is not of the same nature as the assent

     of the President or the Governor underArticle 111and200of the

     Constitution respectively. He placed strong emphasis on the use of the

     expression “consideration” inArticle 254(2)to hold that such a

     consideration by the President would be meaningless in the absence of a

     clear and specific reference made to him pointing out the repugnancy

     between the Central law and the proposed State law.

354. While the observations made in Kaiser-I-Hind (supra) as regards the import

     of the expression “consideration” were in the context ofArticle 254(2), theW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 324 of 414same would apply to every bill reserved for the consideration of the

    President underArticle 201as the expression “consideration” finds a

    mention inArticle 201as well. Thus, the reservation for the consideration

    of the President must be accompanied by a reference which contains specific

    details as regards the purpose why the consideration of the President is

    sought.
355. The reason why this Court in Kaiser-I-Hind (supra) insisted that the

    requirement of delineating the reasons necessitating the reservation of a bill

    by the Governor rests upon the State government is because it is the State

    through its Council of Ministers who are objectively better equipped in

    doing so, by virtue of the fact that the genesis of such bills is normally

    spearheaded by the Council of Ministers. Their close involvement in the

    deliberations that culminated into the bill, their crucial role as part of the

    members of the house of legislature and them being reposed with the

    responsibility of overall governance and well-being of the State, provides

    them the necessary expertise to assign robust reasons in making a reference.

    The State Council of Ministers being uniquely positioned to understand the

    legislative requirements of the State, the policy imperatives prevailing

    therein, and the socio-economic conditions demanding redressal, can better

    voice the reasons that ought to accompany such a reference which the

    Governor otherwise may not be capable of reasonably and comprehensively

    ascertaining if not for the aid and advice of the council of ministers.W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 325 of 414
356. It is in this background that we are of the view that the Governor would be

     duty bound to give careful deference to the aid and advice of the State

     Council of Ministers and only in the limited of exceptional circumstances

     may he deviate from such advice tendered to him, subject to the reference

     being in tune with the aforesaid principles enunciated in the preceding

     paragraphs.

357. We have given some thought to the observations made in the aforesaid

     decisions as regards the non-justiciability of the assent of the President. As

     per the settled principles of parliamentary democracy across the world, the

     grant of assent to legislations is construed as a power of the head of state

     which is to be exercised only upon the aid and advice of the Council of

     Ministers. As perArticles 74(2)and163(3)of the Constitution respectively,

     the question whether any, and if so what, advice was tendered by the

     Ministers to the President or the Governor, shall not be inquired into by any

     court. A perusal ofArticles 111, 200and201respectively makes it clear that

     no reasons are required to be provided by the President or the Governor for

     according assent to bills. However, if the President or the Governor exercise

     the option of withholding of assent underArticle 111or 200 respectively,

     then there is a requirement to communicate the reasons for such withholding

     in the form of a message to the House or Houses of the legislature. Similarly,W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 326 of 414as has been discussed with great emphasis in Kaiser-I-Hind (supra), if there

     is any reservation of Bills for the consideration of the President by the

     Governor, then the same must be reflected by way of a specific and clear

     reference providing details as to why the reservation has been made so as to

     enable the President to “consider” the desirability of according assent to the

     bill so reserved.

358. The grant of assent to a bill is an exercise which generally takes place on the

     aid and advice of the Council of Ministers, and assenting to the bill is the

     only practically possible course of action available to the constitutional

     heads in most of the common law jurisdictions. The grant of assent may not

     be justiciable because, there exists an unavailability of any material upon

     which the courts may be able to undertake a judicial scrutiny. However, the

     same would not be the case as regards the withholding of assent or

     reservation of the bill for the consideration of the President, which can only

     be exercised upon furnishing of detailed reasons for the same.
359. The majority opinion of the Court in Kaiser-I-Hind (supra) held that the

     legislative procedure to be followed before the enactment of a legislation

     would always be amenable to judicial review and thus it would be open to

     the Courts to examine the reference which is made by the State government

     to the President seeking his assent. Applying the same logic, it could be saidW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 327 of 414that the reservation of bills by the Governor for the consideration of the

     President is also part of legislative procedure and thus the Courts would not

     be precluded from examining such reference to determine its legality and its

     constitutional veracity.

360. In the Canadian decision in Galati (supra) the grant of royal assent to a bill

     was held as non-justiciable on the ground of separation of powers, the grant

     of assent having been characterised as a legislative act. However, it must be

     kept in mind that the characterisation of the grant of assent as a legislative

     act was in the context of the well settled constitutional convention of a

     responsible government that assent must be granted in accordance with the

     advice of the Prime Minister. Further, as we have discussed in the preceding

     paragraphs, it is not the source of power, but the contents thereof which

     determine the scope of judicial review under the Constitution.
361. On the contrary, Anne Twomey writes that in cases where a Constitution is

     prescriptive, and a constitutional breach is involved, a court is more likely

     to hold the breach to be a justiciable issue, even if it relates to the grant of

     assent to a bill. She refers to the opinion of Millhouse, J. in Re

     Constitutional Reference No 1 of 2008 reported in [2009] 1 LRC 453,

     which held that where a country has a written Constitution, the courts always

     have the jurisdiction to remedy breaches of the Constitution. The saidW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 328 of 414decision was also accepted by the Court of Appeal of Vanuatu in Republic

    of Vanuatu v Carcasses reported in [2010] 2 LRC 264 which held that

    while a court will not otherwise inquire into or adjudicate upon issues arising

    in Parliament, it would be empowered to interpret and determine whether

    there has been a breach of a constitutional right.

362. As described in Kaiser-I-Hind (supra), the role of the President underArticle 201is a sui-generis one, tailor made to fit the quasi-federal

    constitutional scheme. The role of the Governor in reserving bills for the

    consideration of the President is also intrinsically linked with this constituent

    role of the President. It was also observed that the grant of assent is

    considered a legislative act only for the limited purpose that without it a bill

    cannot become law and also for extending immunity to certain formalities

    to be followed within the legislature. This immunity does not extend to other

    aspects of the legal procedure which fall beyond the ambit of these limited

    formalities. Thus, compliance with the prescribed legislative procedure

    leading up to assent is open to judicial scrutiny in appropriate cases. Further,

    as we have discussed in the preceding paragraphs, the reservation of bills for

    the consideration of the President by the Governor is warranted only in

    certain limited situations.
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 329 of 414
363. The observations in the aforesaid decisions as regards the non-justiciability

     of the assent of the President underArticle 201cannot be construed to mean

     that the withholding of assent and reservation of bills by the Governor underArticle 200, as well as withholding of assent by the President underArticle

     201are beyond the scope of judicial review. The observations of non-

     justiciability of assent of the President underArticle 201can be explained

     in light of the assent underArticle 201being predominantly a matter of

     federal policy of the Union government. On certain subject matters

     prescribed in various provisions of the Constitution, and on subject matters

     falling in the Concurrent List, the Constitution has accorded primacy to the

     Centre over the States. On issues of repugnancy, for illustration, it is only

     on the approval of the President, that a State law which is repugnant to a

     Central legislation can become enforceable. No obligation is placed on the

     President to grant assent underArticle 201and it is to be decided by the

     President on the aid and advice of the Union Council for Ministers. It is in

     view of this position and for the limited extent of judicially manageable

     standards of evaluation that the assent underArticle 201has been described

     as non-justiciable.

364. However, the same is not the case when the courts have to consider the

     withholding of assent or reservation of bills by the Governor under Article
200. Our discussion on the scope of discretion available to the GovernorW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                     Page 330 of 414makes it clear that the Governor exercises discretion in a very limited

    domain when discharging his functions underArticle 200.He may reserve

    the bills for the consideration of the President only for achieving certain

    predetermined purposes and his personal views, disliking for the policy, or

    the views of the Union government are not grounds on which he may reserve

    a bill underArticle 200.The nature of constitutional function prescribed for

    the Governor underArticle 200being such, the exercise of such function

    can be subjected to judicial review on the standard of being within

    constitutional bounds. Reserving a bill for the consideration of the President

    is a part of the legislative procedure and must invariably be subjected to

    judicial review in cases where the constitutionally prescribed procedure is

    not complied with, or misused.

365. The discharge of functions by the President underArticle 201stands on a

    different footing than that of the Governor underArticle 200.While there is

    no political hue to the limited discretion conferred upon the Governor underArticle 200, and any exercise of such discretion has to be solely on

    constitutional grounds, the grant of assent underArticle 201has an element

    of political hue by virtue of the fact that the President underArticle 201has

    been given the prerogative to decide whether the grant of assent in certain

    cases would be desirable or not. However, at the same time, what must be

    remembered is that it is only in those areas where the primacy has been givenW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 331 of 414to the Union would this political consideration be permissible. Additionally,

     this political hue is not owing to the difference in opinion or political views

     of the governments at the Centre and the State but is attributable to the

     desirability of vesting the Union government to exercise certain discretion

     in matters pertaining to broader issues where uniformity in national policy

     may be desirable. In such a case, the scope of justiciability underArticle 201would be limited to questions of arbitrariness, malafides and inaction.
366. As a logical sequitur of the above, any exercise ofArticle 201in a manner

     which does not align with this fundamental object underlyingArticle 201would be liable to a greater degree of judicial scrutiny. Thus, wherever a bill

     which falls within the exclusive domain of the State legislature is being

     referred to the President for his consideration on the ground that it attracts

     one of the exceptional situations where the Governor may exercise his

     discretion as mentioned in paragraph 300 of this judgment, it would not be

     open to the President to withhold assent without ascribing reasons as regards

     the doubt raised by the Governor to such a bill. In such a case, the ideal

     course for the President would be to obtain legal opinion as regards the bill,

     in appropriate cases, by making reference to this Court underArticle 143,

     and only thereafter declare the grant or withholding of assent. Where the

     grounds of withholding of assent are not concerned with policy areas in

     which the Union has primacy, the courts would have a greater degree ofW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 332 of 414judicial scrutiny. We say this because on questions of legality, it is the

    constitutional courts which have been conferred with the power of arriving

    at a final decision and the object ofArticle 201is not to thwart the legislative

    procedure of the States by withholding of assent even in areas falling within

    the exclusive domain of the States on grounds of legality.
367. We summarise our findings on the judicial review of the exercise of power

    by the Governor underArticle 200and by the President underArticle 201of the Constitution as follows:
Hind (supra). Such a reservation can be assailed by the State

             Government, if the reference made by the Governor either fails

             to indicate the reasons for such reservation as discussed above

             or that the reasons indicated are wholly irrelevant, mala-fide,

             arbitrary,     unnecessary   or   motivated     by    extraneous

             considerations. Then such a reservation would be liable to be

             set aside. This question being purely of a legal nature would be

             completely justiciable and the competent court would be after

             a proper adjudication fully authorized to approve or disapprove

             of such reservation by the Governor. If such a challenge finds

             favour with the competent court, then, subject to any other

             considerations, it would be fit case for issuance of a writ in the

             nature of mandamus to the Governor for appropriate action. If

             however, the challenge should fail then the mechanism

             envisaged underArticle 201of the Constitution will spring into

             action.

(iii)    Where the reservation of a bill by the Governor for the

             consideration of the President is on the grounds of peril to

             democracy or democratic principles or on other exceptional

             grounds as mentioned in M.P. Special Police (supra) and

             Nabam Rebia (supra) then the Governor would be expected toW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 335 of 414make a specific and clear reference to the President properly

             indicating the reasons for entertaining such a belief by

             pinpointing the specific provisions in this regard and the

             consequent effect that may ensue if such a bill were to be

             allowed to become a law. The Governor while making such a

             reference should also indicate his subjective satisfaction as to

             why the aforesaid consequences that may ensue cannot be

             possibly curtailed or contained by taking recourse to the

             constitutional courts of the country. It shall be open to the State

             Government to challenge such a reservation on the ground of

             failure on part of the Governor to furnish the necessary reasons

             as discussed aforesaid or that the reasons indicated are wholly

             irrelevant, mala-fide, arbitrary, unnecessary or motivated by

             extraneous considerations. This being a question completely

             capable of being determined by the constitutional courts, would

             be fully justiciable.

(iv)     Reservation of a bill on grounds other than the ones mentioned

             above, such as personal dissatisfaction of the Governor,

             political expediency or any other extraneous or irrelevant

             considerations is strictly impermissible by the Constitution and

             would be liable to be set-aside forthwith on that ground alone.W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 336 of 414This will also encompass reservation of a bill by the Governor

                after having already exercised the option of withholding of

                assent in terms ofArticle 200except in such exceptional

                circumstance as mentioned in paragraph 204 of this judgment.
(v)         Where the Governor exhibits inaction in making a decision

                when a bill is presented to him for assent underArticle 200and

                such inaction exceeds the time-limit as has been prescribed by

                us in paragraph 250 of this judgment then it shall be open to the

                State Government to seek a writ of mandamus from a

                competent court against the Governor directing expeditious

                decision on the concerned bill as is the mandate of the

                Constitution, however, it is clarified that the Governor may

                successfully resist such a challenge on providing sufficient

                explanation for the delay caused.
b. Where the Governor reserves a bill for the consideration of the President

    and the President in turn withholds assent thereto then, it shall be open

    to the State Government to assail such an action before this Court. Such

    a challenge can broadly be made on the following grounds:
368. We summarise our findings on the judicial review of the exercise of power

    by the President under Article 201in withholding assent to a bill as follows:
369. We clarify that the possible situations illustrated by above are not meant to

      be exhaustive and in the specific facts of a given case, the courts may evolve

      new standards of judicial scrutiny to ensure that the constitutionally

      prescribed procedure is adhered to in letter and spirit.



vi.    What is the manner in which the President underArticle 201of the
       Constitution is required to act once a Bill has been reserved for his
       consideration by the Governor underArticle 200of the Constitution?
370. As we have discussed,Article 200provides three courses of action to the

      Governor when a bill is presented to him - to assent, to withhold assent or to

      reserve the bill for the consideration of the President. If he declares assent,

      then the bill becomes an Act of the State legislature. If he withholds assent,

      then the procedure prescribed under the first proviso springs into motion.

      However, the procedure which is to be followed once a bill is reserved for

      the consideration of the President is provided inArticle 201of the

      Constitution.Article 201was adopted without any debate in the Constituent

      Assembly on 01st August, 1949. It reads as follows:
371. A plain reading ofArticle 201indicates that once a bill is reserved by the

     Governor for the consideration of the President, the President has two

     options to choose from - he may either assent to the bill, which would bring

     the legislative process to a conclusion and the bill would become an act, or

     he may withhold his assent to the bill.

372. The proviso toArticle 201provides that in case of bills other than money

     bills, the President may direct the Governor to return the bill to the State

     legislature together with a message as is mentioned in the first proviso toArticle 200.Once the bill is so returned, the State legislature is required to

     reconsider the bill in light of the suggestions of the President within a period

     of six months and if the Bill is passed again, with or without amendments,

     it shall be presented again to the President for his consideration.W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 341 of 414
373. There are some features ofArticle 201which are markedly different fromArticles 111and200.The proviso toArticle 111as well as the first proviso

    toArticle 200mandate the President and the Governor respectively to assent

    to a bill which has been reconsidered by the Parliament and State legislature

    respectively and presented to them for the second time. However, the

    proviso toArticle 201does not place any such obligation on the President

    to mandatorily accord assent to a bill which is placed before him after

    reconsideration by the State legislature. This is evident from the absence of

    the expression “shall not withhold assent therefrom” in the proviso to Article
201. This is also brought out from the difference between the language

    employed inArticles 111and200vis-a-vis that employed inArticle 201.The first proviso toArticle 111uses the expression “and if the Bill is passed

    again by the Houses with or without amendment and presented to the

    President for assent”. Similarly, the first proviso toArticle 200also uses the

    expression “and if the Bill is passed again by the House or Houses with or

    without amendment and presented to the Governor for assent”. However,

    the proviso toArticle 201uses the expression “and, if it is again passed by

    the House or Houses with or without amendment, it shall be presented again

    to the President for his consideration”. Instead of the expression “for

    assent”, the proviso toArticle 201uses the expression “for his

    consideration” thereby indicating that the President is not bound to accordW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 342 of 414assent to a bill even when it is presented to him for the second time. In other

    words, the object behind presentation of the bill for the second time after

    reconsideration underArticles 111and200respectively is to obtain assent,

    whereas underArticle 201, the object of the presentation is to yet again

    present the bill for the consideration of the President.
374. Further, the proviso toArticle 201places an obligation on the State

    legislature to reconsider the bill in accordance with the suggestions of the

    President within a period of six months from the date of receipt of the

    message containing the suggestions. There is no similar obligation on the

    Parliament or the State legislature to reconsider the bill within a stipulated

    time period underArticles 111and200respectively. This absence of this

    six-month time period underArticles 111and200respectively could also be

    seen as an indication of the primacy which is accorded to the Parliament and

    State Legislature as regards the bill which is presented for assent under the

    said provisions. They may choose to repass the Bill after taking into account

    the message which has been sent without being bound by the rigours of a

    time-limit. This is because it is they who ultimately decide whether the bill

    would see the light of day or not, as far asArticles 111or 200 are concerned.

    As discussed by us in the preceding paragraphs, underArticles 111and200respectively, the bill would only “fall through” if the Parliament or the State

    Legislature chooses or elects not to repass the concerned bill after it has beenW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 343 of 414returned to them and the trust of expediency has been reposed on the

    constitutional head of the country and State, being the President and the

    Governor respectively. However, underArticle 201, the prescription of the

    time-limit of six months for the State legislature to reconsider the bill

    returned to them, is indicative of the fact that the requirement to act

    expediently is also placed on the State legislature.
375. Any symptoms of lethargy exhibited by the State legislature which is the

    recipient of a bill sent after the procedure underArticle 201is adopted, is

    viewed strictly by the Constitution. Here, inaction by the State legislature or

    delayed action by them in terms of repassing of the bill would cause the bill

    to “fall through” instead. The consequences of the failure to act promptly

    and in a punctual manner is more grave and severe for the State legislature

    underArticle 201since the premise is that the occasion for the reservation

    of a bill for the consideration of the President by the Governor may arise

    where a constitutional provision makes the assent of the President a

    condition precedent to a State legislation becoming enforceable or for the

    purpose of conferring some immunity upon the State legislation. Such a

    requirement can be found inArticles 31A, 31C, 254(2), 288(2), 360(4)(a)(ii)etc. The second proviso toArticle 200also makes reservation for the

    consideration of the President mandatory. As we have also discussed, there

    may be certain other legitimate situations where the Governor may, inW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 344 of 414exercise of his discretion, reserve a bill for the consideration of the

    President. The matters attracting the aforesaid provisions require the

    procedure inArticle 201to be initiated since they pertain to areas wherein

    the Centre could be said to have precedence or an edge over the State

    governments. This is because the considerations herein involve questions

    pertaining to the larger economic policy of the Union, safeguarding the

    fundamental rights of citizens and maintaining the integrity of the country

    as a whole. For example, the uniformity of policy across States for matters

    falling under the Concurrent List would be a valid arena wherein the interest

    of the Union might need to be paid heed to in comparison with those of the

    States. Hence, a higher degree of the power of scrutiny of the President

    would be implicit in such matters and he, having consulted the Union

    Council of Ministers, could be said to have the final say which has the effect

    of overriding those wishes of the State legislature.
376. The special object fulfilled byArticle 201and the important position it

    occupies in maintaining the quasi-federal structure of the country has been

    explained in detail by this Court in Kaiser-I-Hind (supra) as follows:
377. Dr. K.C. Markandan writes thatArticle 201seeks to serve the same purpose

         in the legislative sphere asArticle 365seeks to do in the administrative

         sphere, namely, make the Constitution “unfederal” in character, to establish

         the fact that the distribution of legislative power between the Centre and the

         States is not on an exclusive basis but that the exercise of legislative power

         of the State is subject to the overall responsibility of the Centre and its

         legislative ambit. He states that no other explanation can justify the inclusion

         of this provision in the Constitution.31
378. It is in such a background and context that the prescription of the six-month

         time limit upon the State legislature for re-passing the Bill and presenting it

         before the President for his consideration assumes more significance. Non-

         adherence or any absence of deference to this time-limit would prove to be

         detrimental to the cause of the State itself since the balance of power is

         inherently skewed in favour of the Union on such matters. Having said so,

         and also conscientiously discussed by us in the preceding paragraphs, this is

         why the reference by the Governor of bills for the consideration of the

         President must be strictly by and under the strength of clear provisions of

         the Constitution.
31K.C. MARKANDAN, CENTRE STATE RELATIONS THE PERSPECTIVE 120 (ABS Publications 1986).W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                                 Page 347 of 414
379. The features ofArticle 201which have been the cause of differences in

     Centre-State relations over the years are as follows:
Owing to this, a number of bills enacted by the legislatures of various

         States remain pending with the President awaiting a decision.

      b. There being no obligation upon the President to mandatorily assent to a

         bill underArticle 201, if a bill is reserved for the consideration of the

         President by the Governor acting in his discretion, then it has the effect

         of rendering the enactment of the bill by the State legislature nugatory,

         if the President keeps the bill pending with him or declares the

         withholding of assent to such a bill.

380. As regards the issue of delay underArticle 201, as we have discussed in the

     preceding paragraphs, the Sarkaria Commission observed that the delay in

     the expeditious disposal of bills reserved for the consideration of the

     President was one of the major causes of strain in Centre-State relations. It

     also recommended that definite timelines must be adopted for facilitating

     the efficient disposal of references underArticle 201.The timelinesW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 348 of 414suggested by the Commission are indicated in paragraph 120 of this

     judgment.

381. Besides prescribing timelines, the Commission also suggested that the

     reference being made by the Governor must be self-contained and contain

     all necessary information. We have discussed that the same was also

     observed by this Court in Kaiser-I-Hind (supra) in the context of references

     being made underArticle 254(2).The reading of a timeline inArticle 201was also suggested by the Punchhi Commission.

382. While the language ofArticle 201does not provide for any timelines within

     which the President is required to act, the absence of a time limit cannot be

     construed as indicating that the discharge of functions by the President under

     the said Article can be done without due deference to the important nature

     of the role they occupy as regards the legislative machinery of the State. Any

     bill(s) reserved for the consideration of the President cannot become an act

     unless it receives the assent as is mentioned inArticle 201, and thus, long

     and undue delays in the disposal of references by the President would have

     the effect of keeping the bill(s), which are an expression of the popular will

     embodied by the State legislature, in an indefinite and uncertain state of

     abeyance.
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 349 of 414
383. Although we are cognisant of the fact that in discharge of his powers underArticle 201, the President is expected to “consider” the bill and such

     “consideration” may be difficult to be bound by strict timelines, yet it cannot

     be a ground to justify inaction on part of the President.
384. We have discussed in detail in the preceding paragraphs that where no time

     for the exercise of a power has been stipulated, such power must be

     exercised in a reasonable time, so as to not render the subject matter

     nugatory or dilute the purpose sought to be achieved. The delay on part of

     the President in deciding a reference underArticle 201, without any

     justification or necessity, would fall foul of the basic constitutional principle

     that the exercise of a power must not be arbitrary and capricious. The

     implications of inaction being of a serious nature and detrimental to the

     federal fabric of the Constitution, there should be no scope for unnecessary

     delay on part of the President underArticle 201as well.
385. At this juncture, we deem it apposite to refer to the office memorandum

     issued by the Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India dated

     04.02.2016 to all the Ministries/Departments of the Government of India

     regarding the expeditious disposal of State bills reserved for the assent of

     the President. The same is reproduced hereinbelow:
3. It is requested that all State Bills / Ordinances be
            processed in the light of aforesaid guidelines and within the
            time limit as specified. All the currently pending Bills
            /Ordinances may be reviewed urgently in terms of above
            guidelines in order to ensure their disposal within three
            weeks' time.

4. The receipt of this letter may kindly be acknowledged.

                                             (Emphasis supplied)
386. The aforesaid memorandum indicates that the procedure involved after a

    reference is made to the President by the Governor is that the Union Ministry

    of Home Affairs as the nodal Ministry would refer the substantive issues

    involved in the bill to the appropriate Ministry at the Centre which is

    concerned with the subject matter and issues pertaining to the bill’s

    language, drafting or constitutional validity to the Law Ministry at the

    Centre. In this process, the Office Memorandum lays down strict guidelines

    directing the concerned Central Departments or Ministries that the

    objections or views that they may have to the bill must be meaningful andW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 353 of 414precise. Such a stipulation has been laid down because the making of

    unreasonable queries or observations only serves to delay the entire process

    of consideration of a bill by the President underArticle 201.The Ministry

    concerned with the substantive issues as regards the bill is required to

    communicate their views to the Home Ministry within 15 days from the date

    of receipt of the bill. If there is a deviation from the said time restriction,

    they must assign reasons for the delay that has ensued on their part. The

    failure to indicate so within a maximum period of one month, is construed

    strictly and understood to mean that the concerned Ministry may have no

    comments whatsoever to offer on the proposal. A perusal of the aforesaid

    also makes it clear that a timeline of three months has been prescribed for

    the decision on bills reserved for the President. A time limit of three weeks

    has been prescribed for the disposal of ordinances of an urgent nature.
387. Another office memorandum was issued by the Ministry of Home Affairs to

    all the States/UTs on the same date in this regard and is reproduced below:
Since a time bound disposal of State Legislations etc. is in the
        interest of the State Governments, it is requested that
        appropriate instructions may be issued to all concerned to
        adhere to the timeline of one month for responding to the
        comments/views of the Central Departments/ Ministries as
        conveyed by the MHA. If the requisite clarifications/views are
        not received from the State Government within the stipulated
        one month's time, it will be construed that the State
        Government agrees with the observation and has no
        comments to offer.

4. It has also been observed that many a time the Bill etc,
        contains drafting errors and State Governments, despite
        repeated persuasion, do not withdraw such Bills. Since a Bill
        containing errors cannot be presented to the President, State
        Governments are requested to kindly verify and check that a
        Bill is free from any drafting/typographical error. It is also
        observed that many a time the State Governments agree to
        make amendments as per the suggestions of Central
        Ministries/Departments, but still keeps on insisting for assent
        of the Bill in its original form. It is therefore requested that
        once the State Government tends to agree with the objections/
        views of the Central Departments/Ministries, the State
        Government may consider sending a consolidated proposal
        alongwith suggested amendments/modifications instead of
        insisting for assent of the Bill in their original formW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 356 of 414
4. It is requested that all concerned may be instructed to
            follow the aforesaid guidelines scrupulously. All the existing
            cases pending with the State Government may kindly be
            reviewed in the light of these guidelines in a time-bound
            manner.

5. The receipt of this letter may kindly be acknowledged.

388. The aforesaid memorandum then clarifies that when the appropriate

    Ministry at the Centre, which is concerned with the substantive issues,

    makes any objections, the same is then shared with the concerned State

    government for further seeking their views or clarifications on the matter.

    This is done with the object of apprising the concerned Central Ministry of

    the clarifications of the State government on the matter. A time-limit of one

    month has been prescribed for the same. As aspect of concern highlighted

    herein was the inaction or delayed action on part of the State government to

    furnish these relevant clarifications which further has the ripple effect of

    postponing the decision of the Centre on the matter. It was further prescribed

    that the State Governments must rectify any drafting or typographical errors

    pointed out by the Central Government and once the suggestions of the

    Central Government are accepted, the State governments should send aW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 357 of 414consolidated proposal containing the amendments rather than insisting on

     the assent to bill in the original form.

389. It becomes clear upon the perusal of the guidelines that in recognition of the

     urgent and important nature ofArticle 201, the Central Government has

     framed clear guidelines as regards the time limits and the manner in which

     references underArticle 201are expected to be disposed of. The guidelines

     also lay down that any delay caused in the seeking of clarifications and

     making of suggestions by any Ministry would have to be explained by

     furnishing reasons, in the absence of which, it would be assumed that they

     have no objections. It would be apposite for us to observe here that the idea

     of imposing timelines on the various stakeholders would not be antithetical

     or alien to the procedure that surrounds the discharge of constitutional

     functions underArticle 201.The existence of the aforesaid two Office

     Memorandums further substantiates such an interpretation. Afterall, no

     memorandum which is contrary to the substance and spirit ofArticle 201can be allowed to command any procedure between the Union and the States

     The factum of its existence and acceptance reveals that the requirement of

     expeditious or even a strict time-bound action would be consistent with the

     aim and object ofArticle 201.
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 358 of 414
390. The recommendations made by the Sarakaria and Punchhi Commissions

     respectively and the guidelines framed by the Central government taken

     collectively indicate the expediency involved in the disposal of references

     underArticle 201along with the importance of the role of the President. In

     this backdrop, it must be made clear that the Courts would not be powerless

     to intervene in cases where the exercise of function by a constitutional

     authority is not being done without a reasonable time.
391. We, therefore, deem it appropriate to adopt the timeline prescribed by the

     Ministry of Home Affairs in the aforesaid guidelines, and prescribe that the

     President is required to take a decision on the bills reserved for his

     consideration by the Governor within a period of three months from the date

     on which such reference is received. In case of any delay beyond this period,

     appropriate reasons would have to be recorded and conveyed to the

     concerned State. The States are also required to be collaborative and extend

     co-operation by furnishing answers to the queries which may be raised and

     consider the suggestions made by the Central government expeditiously.
392. We may now advert ourselves to the question on the nature of the proviso toArticle 201and whether it is intrinsically attached to the option of

     withholding of assent available to the President underArticle 201, similar to

     how the first proviso is fastened to the option of withholding assent availableW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 359 of 414to the Governor underArticle 200.Furthermore, how and in what scenarios

    would the President resort to directing the Governor to return the bill to the

    House or Houses together with a message?

393. This Court inState of Punjab(supra) had reached the conclusion that the

    option of withholding of assent under the substantive part ofArticle 200would be tethered to the first proviso thereto, predominantly because of the

    clear use of the expression “shall not withhold assent therefrom” therein. It

    is limpid that an identical expression remains absent in the proviso to Article
201. Despite this, we must not lose sight of the fact that it was also

    authoritativelylaid down inthe same decision that a proviso may fulfil the

    purpose of being an exception or, explanation/addition to the substantive

    provision of a statute. Therefore, despite the absence of a similar expression

    mandating the President to not withhold assent in the proviso toArticle 201,

    constitutional principles would require us to read the proviso in conjunction

    with the option of withholding assent which the President is empowered to

    choose from.

394. We say so because the scheme under which the constitutional heads of both

    the country and the State respectively are required to operate, does not

    contemplate the idea of an ‘absolute veto’, thereby meaning that there can

    be no withholding of assent without furnishing of reasons. This is owing toW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 360 of 414the fact that the simpliciter withholding of assent both by the President and

     the Governor would be impermissible within the fundamental principles of

     a constitutional democracy.

395. Since the notion of ‘simpliciter withholding’ is an anathema toArticle 200of the Constitution, there cannot be any gainsaying that any ‘withholding of

     assent’ in terms ofArticle 201must also only take place on the strength of

     a specific provision of the Constitution that envisages the requirement of

     assent of the President in the first place i.e., those traceable to instances

     envisaged under Article(s) 31A, 31C, 254(2), 288(2), 360(4)(i)(a), etc. but

     also must be accompanied by sound and specific reasons that necessitate the

     withholding, by clearly outlaying the policy considerations on which such

     an action is predicated.

396. While in the preceding paragraphs we have elaborated that the Governor

     does not hold the power to exercise ‘absolute veto’ on any bill, we see no

     reason why the same standard would also not apply to the President underArticle 201as well. The President is not an exception to this default rule

     which permeates throughout our Constitution. Such unbridled powers

     cannot be said to remain in either of these constitutional posts. The only

     exception that has been carved out by the Constitution as regards the

     exercise of powers by the Governor and that of the President under Article(s)W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                     Page 361 of 414200 and201of the Constitution is that in the former, the Governor once

    having withheld assent from a bill would then be bound to assent upon the

    reconsideration of such bill, whereas in the latter no such compulsion is

    constitutionally imagined for the President, owing to the very fact that the

    grant or withholding of assent in terms ofArticle 201is not the ordinary

    law-making procedure so far as the States are concerned, it is an

    extraordinary situation that only arises wherever policy considerations are

    involved in an otherwise State legislation but nevertheless having the

    propensity of a pan-country effect that is necessitated by the very quasi-

    federal nature of our polity.

397. The natural corollary of the constitutional abhorrence to the notion of

    simpliciter withholding of assent within our Constitution is that a

    requirement and responsibility of assigning reasons to the withholding of

    assent is cast upon the President. What follows from this is that the reasons

    assigned by the President for withholding of assent must be communicated

    to the State government concerned. Such an inference is legitimate since

    there remains no logic in assigning reasons if the same cannot be responded

    to and addressed by the State government. Putting the State government to

    proper notice of the reconsiderations or amendments to the bill, which the

    Council of Ministers at the Centre may have, is also an essential obligation

    inhered in such situations. In the absence of such communication, thereW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                     Page 362 of 414exists a real and grave danger of denying the State government the

    knowledge of the reasons due to which the bill passed by the State legislature

    had not been assented to. Furthermore, there may exist situations where the

    State governments may be amenable to some remedial changes or

    amendments. However, in the absence of any communication, they may be

    robbed of any chance to undertake those changes and ensure that the bill

    becomes law in their State. The State governments must not be prevented

    from entertaining or possibly incorporating the changes or amendments to

    the bill which was originally referred to the President, solely due to the

    absence of a transparent information sharing mechanism, which the State

    government may be said to be entitled to in a federal polity. Entertaining

    such a dialogue assumes importance since the fulcrum of a healthy Centre-

    State relations, in a constitutional democracy, is the transparent

    collaboration and cooperation between the Union and the States.
398. The mandate for an effective and purposeful dialogue has been

    constitutionally recognised and approved through the proviso toArticle 201.Making the exercise of this proviso optional or subjecting it to the discretion

    of the President to use wherever and whenever he deems fit would deprive

    the States of an important safeguard which has been clearlylaid down inthe

    Constitution. Although we are not oblivious to the fact that the Office

    Memorandums referred by us above provide an opportunity for the StateW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 363 of 414government to respond to the objections that the concerned Ministry at the

    Centre may have, we must remember that such an Office Memorandum

    cannot be used to bypass a procedure alreadylaid down inthe text of the

    Constitution. Furthermore, the sending of objections and receipt of

    clarifications to and from the State government while the proposed bill is

    under consideration of the President through the concerned Ministry at the

    Centre, is to enable and infuse an informed decision making in the entire

    process to avoid any haste or non-application of mind, before taking any

    decision of either grant of assent or withholding thereof in the first place.
399. However, at this stage we may clarify, that although the Memorandum

    mandates that there must be a channel of transparent and purposeful

    communication between the State Government and the Central Government,

    yet this does not mean that the requirement of sending a message in terms

    of the proviso toArticle 201is eliminated. Mere existence of any

    communication that may take place prior to any decision being taken underArticle 201is no reason to shirk the constitutional responsibility of officially

    communicating the message to the concerned State legislature. There lies a

    very fundamental difference between the communication envisaged under

    the Memorandum and that under the proviso toArticle 201.The former is

    only to address any preliminary objections or doubts as regards the proposed

    bill and which prevent a meaningful decision from being taken by theW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 364 of 414President underArticle 201whereas under the latter, the idea is to

     communicate the reasons as to how the President arrived at his decision to

     withhold assent along with specifying the provisions of the proposed bill

     that should be reconsidered by the State legislature.
400. In other words, the sending of preliminary objections under the

     Memorandum cannot be equated to the message under the proviso toArticle

     201, which is used to communicate the aspects of the proposed bill to be

     reconsidered and how they may be reconsidered by the State legislature.

     Unlike the memorandum, the message underArticle 201of the Constitution

     is of seminal significance inasmuch as it facilitates the repassing of the bill

     by the State legislature. What emerges from the aforesaid is that when the

     President declares the withholding of assent of the State legislature’s

     proposed bill, it would be his constitutionally bounden duty to also set into

     motion the proviso toArticle 201.

401. In short, after due consultation with the State government, the President may

     either declare assent to the bill or he may declare that he withholds assent

     thereto. It would not be appropriate for the President to declare withholding

     of assent without first seeking clarifications from the State government as is

     mentioned in the guidelines featuring in the Office Memorandums. If, in the

     course of discussions, the State government expresses willingness to makeW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 365 of 414such changes to the bill as may be suggested by the Central government,

    then it would be open to the President to seek reconsideration of the bill by

    invoking the proviso, and upon the bill being re-considered and passed with

    such changes, the President may grant assent thereto.
402. At this stage, it would be prudent for the President while choosing to

    withhold assent to the bill and setting the proviso into motion, to address the

    issues, views, changes, amendments or recommendations that he may have

    comprehensively and in one go. Piecemeal exercise of the proviso toArticle

    201must be dissuaded. This is to prevent the endless loop of sending and

    re-sending of the bill that may ensue between the President acting under the

    proviso toArticle 201and the House or Houses of the State Legislature. A

    purposive interpretation ofArticle 201does not in any manner envisage a

    never-ending cycle of communications between the President and the State

    Government. Such conduct would tantamount to abusing the essence of the

    proviso which embodies fostering a collaborative spirit between the Union

    and the States. Therefore, the exercise of the power under the proviso must

    also be done in good faith and in a bona fide manner.

403. The object underlyingArticle 201and the significance it holds for the

    enforceability of a State legislation would be frustrated if the procedure

    therein is reduced to an endless cycle of back and forth without any chanceW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 366 of 414for fruition of the aspirations of the people of the State on mere

     technicalities. Therefore, the President is expected to follow the procedure

     envisaged under the proviso with a sense of responsibility whenever

     necessary. In the ordinary course of action, a bill must be sent back for the

     reconsideration of the State legislature under the proviso toArticle 201, only

     once.

404. After the bill is sent with a message to State legislature by the President and

     they repass it, with or without amendments, the President would be

     empowered to take a final call on the giving or withholding of assent on the

     bill concerned. If he chooses to assent to the bill, it would become law. There

     is no gainsaying to the fact that the President underArticle 201is conferred

     with the power to withhold a bill during the second round, without activating

     any other procedure, effectively bringing the legislative process vis-à-vis

     that same bill to an end, in contrast to the scheme ofArticle 200wherein the

     Governor must mandatorily accord his assent to a Bill which is presented to

     him for the second time.

405. However, if he chooses to withhold his assent, the bill will not take birth as

     law. It must, however, be noted that even during the withholding of assent

     of a bill received on the second round, the President would be required to

     assign clear and sufficiently detailed reasons for arriving at such a decision.W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 367 of 414Even in the second round, he has no power whatsoever to exercise absolute

    veto, as the Constitution does not provide anywhere that withholding of

    assent can be done simpliciter. Hence, the decision to choose the option of

    withholding assent after having set into motion the proviso toArticle 201must not be misconstrued to mean that he is exercising an ‘absolute veto’ or

    a power of a similar nature. We say so because first, the decision has not

    been arrived at in the first instance without communicating reasons to the

    State legislature and providing them with an opportunity to reconsider the

    bill, and secondly, the President is mandated to declare the withholding of

    assent to the repassed bill with cogent and sufficient reasons at this stage as

    well.

406. In cases where the reservation is on the ground of repugnancy of the State

    legislation with a Central legislation, or under one of the provisions where

    the assent of President has been envisaged for the purpose of enforceability

    or imparting immunity to the legislation, it would be a matter where the

    President would decide the question of grant of assent keeping in mind the

    desirability of having a uniformity in the policy across the country on the

    subject matter involved. This, as was held in Kaiser-I-Hind (supra), is

    evident from the fact that the assent underArticle 201is not the same as the

    assent to be granted underArticles 111and201, and the President has been

    given supremacy under the Constitution as regards the bills covered underW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 368 of 414Article 201by virtue of his constituent powers. In this regard, the

observations of the Sarkaria Commission may be referred to as guiding

principles by the President wherein it was observed thus:
Securing uniformity and coordinating policy on the basic
        aspects of such matters in List II, having an interface with
        those in List I, cannot be extraneous to the functions
        exercised by the President in considering State Bills, underArticle 201.
5.10.04Articles 31A(1), 31C, 288(2)and304(b)provide for
        reservation of certain types of State Bills for the
        consideration and assent of the President. These provisions,
        read with Article 201—, enable the Union Executive toW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                         Page 369 of 414ensure, on the basic aspects of these special matters, a
        certain degree of uniformity in the interests of the social and
        economic unity of the country. Examination of the State Bills
        of this special category, from the point of their compatibility
        with the settled policy of the Union, therefore, does not
        involve any impropriety.
President should not withhold assent merely on
        consideration of policy differences with respect to matters
        in List II


        5.10.05 Apart from all such matters on which a measure of
        uniform coordinated policy is desirable, there remains in List
        II an area which is purely of local or domestic concern to the
        States. It is with respect to Bills falling within this area of
        exclusive State concern that utmost caution, circumspection
        and restraint on the part of the Union Executive is required
        in the exercise of its supervisory powers under Article 201—
        . This is all the more necessary if the Bill has been reserved
        by the Governor in the exercise of his discretion, contrary to
        the advice of his Ministers. It may not be prudent to veto such
        a Bill merely on the ground that the legislative policy of the
        Bill, though otherwise constitutional, does not conform with
        what the Union Government thinks should be its policy with
        respect to the subject-matter of the Bill.
5.10.06 We recommend that as a matter of convention, the
        President should not withhold assent only on the
        consideration of policy differences on matters relating, in
        pith and substance, to the State List, except on the grounds of
        patent unconstitutionality such as those indicated in para
        5.6.13 above.”W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 370 of 414
407. Where the ground of reservation of a bill is patent unconstitutionality of a

     nature described in the exceptional situations in M.P. Special Police (supra),

     that is where the bill upon becoming law would be a peril to democracy, the

     decision of the President must be guided by the fact that it is the

     constitutional courts that have been conferred with the ultimate authority of

     interpretation of the Constitution and the laws.

408. When a legislation is apprehended to be patently unconstitutional of the

     nature described in the above paragraph, the courts as the sentinel on qui

     vive have been empowered by the Constitution to test the vires of such

     legislation and there is no bar or limitation to the power of judicial review

     of the courts in this regard. This is in consonance with the constitutional

     scheme of checks and balances between the three wings of the Government

     so as to ensure that absolute power does not vest in one authority. Therefore,

     the power of judicial review by design acts as more than a sufficient

     safeguard against the enactment of an unconstitutional legislation by the

     legislature.

409. However, in cases of challenge to legislations duly passed by the legislature

     and assented to by the executive, the constitutional courts temper their

     judicial review with the presumption that such legislation is constitutional.

     This is because the courts deem it appropriate to not interfere with anW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 371 of 414enactment that has been passed in the wisdom of the legislature and

     symbolises the political will of our people. It is in this context, that we find

     it worthwhile to note the remarks of the eminent constitutional jurist, Nani

     Palkhivala on the object of assent by the executive to a bill – “The object of

     enacting these provisions [Articles 200and201]was perhaps that while the

     constitutionality of a law can be challenged in a court, its wisdom cannot be

     and that it would be better to prevent a clearly unconstitutional legislation

     from becoming law than to have it invalidated by a court later.” However,

     the aforesaid statement should not be construed devoid of its context, more

     particularly in ignorance ofArticle 143of the Constitution which we shall

     now discuss.

410. We are in agreement that one of the object ofArticle 201is also to prevent

     a bill that is perilous to democratic principles. However, we are also of the

     view that a bill appearing to be unconstitutional must be assessed by a

     judicial mind. It is for this reason that both the Sarkaria Commission and the

     Punchhi Commission categorically recommended the President to seek the

     opinion of this Court underArticle 143in respect of bills that may be

     apprehended to be patently unconstitutional.

411.Article 143confers on the President the power to consult this Court any time

     when it appears to the President that a question of law or fact has arisen, orW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 372 of 414is likely to arise, which is of such a nature and of such public importance

     that it is expedient to obtain the opinion of this Court upon it. Therefore, the

     President is not just precluded but constitutionally expected to refer the

     question of vires of a bill to this Court as the apex judicial institution to

     ascertain the constitutionality thereof and accordingly enable the President

     to take action in respect of the said bill underArticle 201.
412. We are of the considered view that although the option to refer a bill to this

     Court underArticle 143may not be mandatory, yet the President, as a

     measure of prudence, ought to seek an opinion under the said provision in

     respect of bills that have been reserved for the consideration of the President

     on grounds of perceived unconstitutionality. This is all the more necessary

     as there is no mechanism at the State level for the Governor to refer bills to

     the constitutional courts for their advice or opinion thereupon. Under the

     scheme of the Constitution as we see it, there is only one possible way for

     the Governor to ascertain the palpable constitutionality of a bill, which is by

     way of reserving it for the consideration of the President who in turn is then

     expected to invokeArticle 143.The Constitution is not a maze, but a

     labyrinth. Although both may semantically appear to be one and the same,

     yet there is a very fine but discernible difference between the two. The

     difference lies in the fact that in a maze one may lose their way within the

     multiple overlapping paths, with the possibility of each of them leading to aW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 373 of 414dead-end, however in a labyrinth one eventually finds the way and in the

    process also come out more enlightened. Similarly, any questions emanating

    from the Constitution or pertaining thereto such as the constitutional vires

    of a law must be uncovered through the foresightedness of our Constitution.

    Wherever, a bill is reserved by the Governor for the President on the ground

    of patent unconstitutionality of the nature wherein the exercise of discretion

    by the Governor is permissible underArticle 163(1), the Constitution

    expects the President to be the soothsayer, easing the sails for the Governor.
413. This very same constitutional obligation cast on the President is also

    provided in Article 154H of the Constitution of Sri Lanka wherein if the

    Governor is of the opinion that a statute enacted by a provincial council is

    unconstitutional, then he may refer the bill to the President who in turn is

    obligated to make a reference to the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka for

    obtaining pronouncement on the constitutional vires of such bill. Where the

    Supreme Court holds the statute to be constitutional, then the Governor is

    bound to grant assent. A similar framework is followed in the Republic of

    Kiribati where Section 66 of the Constitution of Kiribati allows the

    Beretitenti, who is the constitutional head of the State, to withhold assent to

    a bill only if he believes that such bill is inconsistent with the constitution.

    In such a case, he may return the bill back to the Parliament however, if the

    bill is passed again then the only option left with the Beretitenti is to eitherW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 374 of 414assent or to refer its vires to the High Court for a declaration. If the court

    declares the bill to be constitutional then the assent must be granted

    forthwith.

414. The object ofArticle 143in context of reference of bills, whose

    constitutionality is under consideration by the President underArticle 201,

    has been explained by the N.L. Untwalia, J., In Re: The Special Courts Bill,

    1978 reported in (1979) 1 SCC 380. The relevant portion of his judgment is

    reproduced below:
415. The view taken In Re: Special Courts (supra) was that consultative

    jurisdiction underArticle 143may avoid any possible challenges to the viresW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 375 of 414of a bill if it becomes an Act. On basis of the dictum in the said reference,

    we are of the considered view that constitutional courts are not precluded

    from making suggestions or opining about the constitutional validity of a

    bill before the same becomes a law. This is because preventing a patently

    unconstitutional bill from being enacted saves not only public resources but

    also respects the wisdom of the legislature by providing the constitutional

    functionaries associated with the process of passage of a legislation, to

    review the bill and take appropriate actions. However, the approach of

    prevention before cure cannot be stretched to such extent, that the very

    process of reservation becomes a resort for thwarting the very legislative

    powers of the States. The President’s recourse toArticle 143also palliates

    any apprehensions of bias or mala fides in the Central government’s

    approach to bills reserved underArticle 200.

416. The approach to be adopted by the courts in answering references underArticle 143in respect of reserved bills also requires a perusal of

    constitutional provisions viz.Articles 31A, 31C, 254, 288, 360, etc. that

    place a requirement of assent to a bill by the President, either expressly or

    by necessary implication. The scope of these Articles is largely centred

    around social, economic and political objectives that are sought to be

    achieved by a State. The necessity for Presidential assent in case of

    legislations under these Articles is for enabling the Central government toW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                     Page 376 of 414streamline policies and ensure uniformity in socio-economic and welfare

     measures across States. In contemplation of the bills under these Articles,

     the central government, more often than not, has policy considerations in

     mind and the reasons for assent or withholding thereof may not be on purely

     legal grounds.

417. It is in such situations that the court has to be mindful as to whether the

     reference received from the President underArticle 143pertains to pure

     legal questions regarding interpretation of the Constitution or questions that

     are in the nature of a policy consideration. In case of the latter, the Supreme

     Court, having regard to the relevant facts and circumstances, can refuse to

     express its advisory opinion upon being satisfied that the questions presented

     to it are purely socio-economic or political questions and have no relation to

     the Constitution.
418. The exercise of a self-imposed restraint by the court in matters involving

     purely political considerations is in consonance with the doctrine of political

     thicket, that is, the courts do not venture into areas of governance in which

     the Constitution gives a prerogative solely to the executive. For instance, the

     question whether a State legislation repugnant to a central law should be

     assented to by the President or not underArticle 254(2)is largely a policy

     decision on part of the Union Government. In such matters, the court has itsW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 377 of 414hands tied and does not attempt to encroach into the functions of the

    executive wing.

419. However, in certain exceptional circumstances, the Governor may reserve a

    bill for consideration of the President on grounds that the bill is perilous to

    the principles of democracy and an interpretation of the Constitution is

    necessary to ascertain whether such legislation should be granted assent or

    not. In such cases where a bill has been reserved majorly on the grounds of

    not being in consonance with the constitutional principles and involves

    questions of constitutional validity, the executive is supposed to exercise

    restraint. It is expected that the Union executive should not assume the role

    of the courts in determining the vires of a bill and should, as a matter of

    practice, refer such question to the Supreme Court underArticle 143.We

    have no qualms in stating that the hands of the executive are tied when

    engaging with purely legal issues in a bill and only the constitutional courts

    have the prerogative to study and provide recommendations as regards the

    constitutionality of a bill.

420. Since the constitutionality of a bill is a matter which falls within the

    exclusive domain of the courts, the opinion rendered by the Supreme Court

    underArticle 143holds high persuasive value and should ordinarily be

    accepted by the legislature and the executive. We are no strangers to the

    arguments as regards the non-binding nature of the advisory jurisdiction ofW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 378 of 414this Court and that even though a bill may be referred to this Court by the

    President underArticle 143, yet the opinion delivered thereunder may not

    be heeded to. However, merely because the jurisdiction underArticle 143is

    not binding does not undermine the principles used by this Court to

    determine the constitutionality of the bill. This Court in Re Special Courts

    (supra) has held thus:
421. In our considered view, the only reason for which the legislative or the

    executive wing may not take note of the opinion delivered by the Supreme

    Court underArticle 143is when the grounds on which a State bill wasW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 379 of 414reserved for the consideration of the President, are not purely legal but also

     involve certain policy considerations, which may outweigh the issue of

     constitutionality. In such cases, if the President acts contrary to the advice

     of this Court and withholds assent to a bill, he must record cogent reasons

     and materials that justify not granting assent.

422. A lack of reasons or even insufficiency thereof may do violence to the

     concept of ‘limited government’ on which the edifice of our Constitution

     has been built. The whys and wherefores of the President’s actions provide

     a basis for judicial review and allow the courts to assess the validity of the

     decision as well as ensure accountability between the three pillars of

     government which is in consonance with the idea of checks and balances in

     the constitutional set-up of our country.

423. In this context, we are of the considered view that the expression of intention

     by the President through a declaration of reasons supporting his actions

     underArticle 201is of paramount importance and this Court is not inhibited

     in any manner to make a presumption that the President and by extension,

     the Central government, may not have acted in a bona fide manner at the

     time when it exercises its powers of judicial review.W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 380 of 414
424. We would also like to make a reference to Rule 48 of the Tamil Nadu

    Government Business Rules, 1978. The said Rule provides that whenever

    there is legislative proposal for a subject matter falling within the Concurrent

    List, the concerned administrative department should consult the Ministry

    of Home Affairs, whenever possible. Similar requirement is laid down for

    the legislations falling underArticles 31A, 31Band31Cof the Constitution.

    The rules read as follows:

425. Thus, as a matter of prudence, the States should enter into pre-legislation

       consultation with the Central government before introducing legislations on

       matters pertaining to those provisions of the Constitution where the assent

       of the President may be required. Likewise, the Central government, should

       consider the legislative proposals sent by the State governments with due

       regard and expediency. Such a practice reduces friction between Centre-

       State relations and also ensures that future roadblocks are overcome in the

       beginning itself, thereby promoting public welfare.
vii.    On Exercise ofArticle 142.

426.Article 142of the Constitution empowers this Court, in the exercise of its

       jurisdiction to, pass such decree or make such order as is necessary for doing

       complete justice in any cause or matter pending before it.
427. A three-Judge Bench of this Court in A.G. Perarivalan (supra) was dealing

       with the inaction on the part of the Governor of Tamil Nadu in deciding the

       remission petition of the petitioner therein. Despite the resolution passed by

       the State government in favour of granting remission to the petitioner, the

       Governor first kept the matter pending with him for a long duration andW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 382 of 414thereafter, without taking a decision thereupon, referred the same to the

    President.

428. The Court, taking into consideration the huge delay caused by inaction on

    the part of the Governor, and also the adverse impact of such inaction on the

    liberty of the petitioner therein, exercised its powers underArticle 142of

    the Constitution and deemed the petitioner to have served his sentence and

    ordered his release forthwith. The Court observed thus:
429. The Court, while summarizing its observations, further observed that the

    reference made by the Governor to the President had no constitutional

    backing and therefore the reference having been declared erronoeus, and the

    Council of Ministers having advised in the favour of remission, there wasW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 383 of 414no requirement to remand the matter to the Governor for taking a decision

     thereupon. The observations read thus:
430. Coming to the facts of the present case, the Governor first withheld the ten

     bills under question and later despite the said Bills being repassed by the

     State legislature and presented before him again under the first proviso toArticle 200, still reserved them for the consideration of the President. We

     have elaborated in detail that owing to the clear language in which the first

     proviso is couched, there would never arise, except in extraordinary

     situations, any occasion for the Governor to reserve a reconsidered bill for

     the consideration of the President. The said bills, in the absence of any

     message given by the Governor under the first proviso, were taken up for

     reconsideration by the State Assembly and passed in their original form, and

     presented to the Governor for his assent. Thus, undoubtedly, it was not open

     to the Governor to reserve the bills for the consideration of the President and

     he ought to have granted assent.
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 384 of 414
431. Considerable time has elapsed since these ten Bills were originally passed

     and presented to the Governor for assent. Two out of the ten Bills even date

     back to 2020. It is important to keep in mind that the tenure of the State

     legislature is of five years and the representatives are accountable to their

     electorate as regards the enactment of legislations addressing the issues

     faced by the electorate. At the end of every five years, the elected

     representatives have to go back to their electorate and provide a report card,

     based upon which the people, in whom the ultimate sovereignty rests, cast

     their votes. Bills, if kept pending for long despite their passage by the State

     legislature, militate against this very fundamental, essential to the

     sustenance of a representative democracy based on direct elections.
432. The conduct exhibited on part of the Governor, as it clearly appears from the

     events that have transpired even during the course of the present litigation,

     has been lacking in bonafides. There have been clear instances where the

     Governor has failed in showing due deference and respect to the judgments

     and directions of this Court. In such a situation, it is difficult for us to repose

     our trust and remand the matter to the Governor with a direction to dispose

     of the bills in accordance with the observations made by us in this judgment.Article 142empowers this Court to do complete justice and in the facts of

     the present case, more particularly, in light of the fact that the option of

     granting assent to the repassed bills was the only constitutionally permissibleW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                          Page 385 of 414option available with the Governor, we deem it absolutely necessary and

     appropriate to grant that very relief by exercising our extraordinary powers.

     No meaningful purpose would be served by keeping the bills, some of which

     have already been pending for incredulously long periods, pending for more

     time. Therefore, we deem the assent to have been granted.
433. Constitutional authorities are creatures of the Constitution and are bound by

     the limitations prescribed by it. No authority, in exercise of its powers, or to

     put it precisely, in discharge of its duties, must attempt to breach the

     constitutional firewall. The office of the Governor is no exception to this

     supreme command. Whenever there is an attempt by any authority to move

     beyond the bounds of the Constitution, this Court has been entrusted with

     the responsibility to act as the Sentinel on the qui vive and bring back the

     authority within the constitutionally permissible limits by exercising judicial

     review. We are not exercising our power underArticle 142in a casual

     manner, or without giving a thought to it. On the contrary, it is only after

     deepest of deliberations, and having reached at the firm conclusion that the

     actions of the Governor - first in exhibiting prolonged inaction over the bills;

     secondly in declaring a simplicter withholding of assent and returning the

     bills without a message; and thirdly in reserving the bills for the President

     in the second round - were all in clear violation of the procedure envisaged

     under the Constitution, that we have decided to declare the deeming ofW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 386 of 414assent to the ten bills, considering it to be our constitutionally bounden duty.
In our view, that is the only way to ensure that complete justice is done with

     the parties without any delay, and without possibility of any further delay

     due to any inaction on the part of the Governor, or lack of deference on his

     part to this judgment.

H.    CONCLUSION
434. In light of the aforesaid discussion, we answer the questions of law

     formulated by us as under:
ii. Secondly, to withhold assent; or

               iii. Thirdly, to reserve the bill for the consideration of the

                    President.
(II)     The first proviso toArticle 200should be read in conjunction with

              the option of withholding of assent provided in the substantive part

              ofArticle 200.It is not an independent course of action and has to

              be mandatorily initiated by the Governor in cases where the optionW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 387 of 414of withholding of assent is to be exercised. The decision of this

         Court inState of Punjab(supra) lays down the correct position of

         law in this regard.
(III)    The expression “the bill falls through unless the procedure under

         the first proviso is followed” as used inValluri Basavaiah

         Chowdhary(supra) signifies that once the Governor declares

         withholding of assent and returns the bill to the House or Houses,

         the bill would lapse or fall through unless the House or Houses

         reconsider the bill in accordance with the suggestions made by the

         Governor in his message and present it to him after repassing. The

         expression “unless the procedure under the first proviso is

         followed” cannot be construed to mean that the Governor exercises

         discretion in setting the machinery prescribed under the first

         proviso in motion. Once the Governor exercises the option of

         withholding assent, he is under an obligation to follow the

         procedure prescribed in the first proviso “as soon as possible”.(IV)     The decision of this Court inState of Punjab(supra) cannot be said

         to be per incuriam.The observations made in the decision as

         regards attaching of the first proviso with the option of withholding

         of assent are supported by the observations made inValluri

         Basavaiah Chowdhary(supra).
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 388 of 414(V)      Neither the concept of ‘pocket veto’ nor that of ‘absolute veto’ finds

         place within the constitutional scheme and mechanism envisaged

         underArticle 200of the Constitution. The substantive part ofArticle 200consciously uses the expression “shall declare” to

         signify that there is no scope of inaction, and whenever a bill is

         presented to the Governor, he is under a constitutional obligation to

         adopt one of the three courses of action available therein. Further,

         the expression “as soon as possible” in the first proviso permeatesArticle 200with a sense of expediency and does not allow the

         Governor to sit on the bills and exercise pocket veto over them.

         Similarly, by virtue of the first proviso being intrinsically and

         inextricably attached to the option of withholding of assent, there

         is no scope for the Governor to declare a simpliciter withholding of

         assent, meaning thereby that ‘absolute veto’ is also impermissible

         underArticle 200.
(VI)     It goes without saying that the scheme ofArticle 200is

         characterized by the movement of the bill from one constitutional

         authority to another and that too with a sense of expediency. It is

         trite to say thatArticle 200occupies an important role of giving the

         bills passed by the State legislature the authority of an Act. Without

         the procedure envisaged underArticle 200, the bills remain mereW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 389 of 414pieces of paper, skeletons without any flesh or lifeblood flowing

         through their veins, mere documentation of the aspirations of the

         people without any possibility of bringing them to fruition.


(VII)    As a general rule, it is not open for the Governor to reserve a bill

         for the consideration of the President once it is presented to him in

         the second round, after having been returned to the House

         previously as per the first proviso. The use of the expression “shall

         not withhold assent therefrom” appearing in the first proviso places

         a clear embargo on the Governor and is a clear enunciation of the

         requirement that the Governor must assent to a bill which is

         presented to him after complying with the procedurelaid down inthe first proviso. The only exception to this general rule is when the

         bill presented in the second round is materially different from the

         one presented to the Governor in the first instance, as discussed in

         paragraph 204 of this judgment. In such a scenario, it would be

         open for the Governor to choose from the three options provided in

         the substantive part ofArticle 200.
(VIII) In the facts of the present case, the reservation by the Governor of

         the ten Bills for the consideration of the President in the second

         round was illegal, erroneous in law and is thus liable to be set aside.W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 390 of 414As a result, any subsequent action taken upon the said Bills by the

         President also does not survive and is thus set aside.


(IX)     The Bills, having been pending with the Governor for an unduly

         long period of time, and the Governor having acted with clear lack

         of bona fides in reserving the Bills for the consideration of the

         President, immediately after the pronouncement of the decision of

         this Court inState of Punjab(supra), are deemed to have been

         assented to by the Governor on the date when they were presented

         to him after being reconsidered.
(X)      There is no expressly specified time-limit for the discharge of the

         functions by the Governor underArticle 200of the Constitution.

         Despite there being no prescribed time-limit,Article 200cannot be

         read in a manner which allows the Governor to not take action upon

         bills which are presented to him for assent and thereby delay and

         essentially roadblock the law-making machinery in the State.


(XI)     The use of the expression “as soon as possible” in the first proviso

         makes it clear that the Constitution infuses a sense of urgency upon

         the Governor and expects him to act with expediency if he decides

         to declare the withholding of assent.
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                         Page 391 of 414(XII)    The settled position of law is that where no time-limit for the

         exercise of a power is prescribed, the same must be exercised in a

         reasonable time period. Guided by the decisions of this Court in

         A.G. Perarivalan (supra) andKeisham(supra), we find that it is

         no more res-integra that the courts are well-empowered to

         prescribe a time-limit for the discharge of any function or exercise

         of any power which, by its very nature, demands expediency.



(XIII) Prescription of a general time-limit by this Court, within which the

         ordinary exercise of power by the Governor underArticle 200must

         take place, is not the same thing as amending the text of the

         Constitution to read in a time-limit which would fundamentally

         change the procedure and mechanism stipulated byArticle 200.Prescription of such time-limits within the scheme ofArticle 200is

         with a view to lay down a determinable judicial standard for

         ascertaining the reasonable exercise of such power and to curtail

         any arbitrary inaction. This Court while prescribing a time-limit for

         the exercise of power, is guided by the inherent expedient nature of

         the procedure prescribed underArticle 200.
(XIV)    Keeping in mind the constitutional significance ofArticle 200and

         the role it plays in the federal polity of the country, the followingW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 392 of 414timelines are being prescribed. Failure to comply with these

         timelines would make the inaction of the Governors subject to

         judicial review by the courts:
months;
(iii) In case of reservation of bills for the consideration of the

                President contrary to the advice of the State Council of

                Ministers, the Governor shall make such reservation within

                a maximum period of three months;
(iv) In case of presentation of a bill after reconsideration in

                accordance with the first proviso, the Governor must grant

                assent forthwith, subject to a maximum period of one-month.



(XV)     As the general rule, the Governor in exercise of his functions underArticle 200is required to abide by the aid and advice tendered byW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 393 of 414the Council of Ministers. The only exceptions to this rule can be

         traced to the second proviso toArticle 200andArticle 163(1)of

         the Constitution. Thus, only in instances where the Governor is by

         or under the Constitution required to act in his discretion, would he

         be justified in exercising his powers underArticle 200contrary to

         the advice of the Council of Ministers. Further, any exercise of

         discretion by the Governor in exercise of his powers underArticle

         200is amenable to judicial review.
(XVI)    We declare the view taken inB.K. Pavitra(supra) to be per

         incuriam to the extent of the following two observations made

         therein – First, that the Constitution confers discretion upon the

         Governor insofar as the reservation of bills for the consideration of

         the President is concerned and; Secondly, that the exercise of

         discretion by the Governor underArticle 200is beyond judicial

         scrutiny.

The removal of the expression “in his discretion” from

         Section 75 of the GoI Act, 1935 when it was being adapted asArticle 200of the Constitution clearly indicates that any discretion

         which was available to the Governor under the GoI Act, 1935 inW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 394 of 414respect of reservation of bills became unavailable with the

         commencement of the Constitution.

The decision ofB.K. Pavitra(supra) is not in consonance

         with the observations made by the larger bench decision of this

         Court inSamsher Singh(supra).The majority opinion inSamsher

         Singh(supra) in paragraph 28 observed that “Governor is the

         constitutional or formal head of the State and he exercises all his

         powers and functions conferred on him by or under the Constitution

         on the aid and advice of his Council of Ministers save in spheres

         where the Governor is required by or under the Constitution to

         exercise his functions in his discretion” At the cost of repetition,

         we again reiterate “and he exercises all his powers and functions

         conferred on him by or under the Constitution on the aid and

         advice of his Council of Ministers”.

The decision inSamsher Singh(supra) illustrated certain

         provisions of the Constitution which expressly required the

         Governor to exercise his powers in his discretion. The second

         proviso toArticle 200was one such illustration.Thus, it is amply

         clear from the dictum inSamsher Singh(supra) that the seven-

         Judge Bench, after taking into consideration the scheme ofArticleW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                     Page 395 of 414200, observed that the second proviso toArticle 200was the only

         instance where the Governor had been entrusted with the power to

         act in his own discretion.Subsequent Constitution Bench decisions

         in M.P. Special Police (supra) and Nabam Rebia (supra) clarified

         that besides the instances where the Governor has been expressly

         conferred with discretionary powers, there may still be certain

         exceptional circumstances wherein it would be legitimate for him

         to act in his own discretion as indicated by us in paragraph 300.

         However, the general rule remains that the Governor acts upon the

         aid and advice of the State Council of Ministers.

UnderArticle 200of the Constitution, the Governor does not

         possess any discretion in the exercise of his functions and has to

         mandatorily abide by the advice tendered to him by the Council of

         Ministers. The only exceptions to this general rule are as follows:
The observations made inB.K. Pavitra(supra) that “a

         discretion is conferred upon the Governor to follow one of the

         courses of action enunciated in the substantive part of Article 200”

         do not take into consideration the decision ofSamsher Singh(supra) and is for this reason per incuriam.It failed to consider thatArticle 200which had been duly considered bySamsher Singh(supra) was found to contain only one instance where the exercise

         of discretion was expressly provided, that being the second proviso

         thereto. Besides this, as already aforestated, it failed to notice the

         removal of the expression “in his discretion” from Section 75 of

         the GoI Act, 1935 which ultimately culminated intoArticle 200.(XVII) UnderArticle 201, the occasion for the reservation of a bill for the

         consideration of the President by the Governor may arise where a

         constitutional provision makes the assent of the President to be a

         condition precedent to a State legislation becoming enforceable or

         for the purpose of securing some immunity to the State legislation.

         Such a requirement can be found inArticles 31A, 31C, 254(2),W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 397 of 414288(2), 360(4)(a)(ii)etc. The second proviso toArticle 200also

         makes reservation for the consideration of the President mandatory.

         As we have also discussed, there may be certain other situations

         where by peril to fundamental principles of representative

         democracy, the Governor may, in exercise of his discretion, reserve

         a bill for the consideration of the President.
(XVIII) There is no ‘pocket veto’ or ‘absolute veto’ available to the

         President in discharge of his functions underArticle 201.The use

         of the expression “shall declare” makes it mandatory for the

         President to make a choice between the two options available under

         the substantive part ofArticle 201, that is, to either grant assent or

         to withhold assent to a bill. The constitutional scheme does not, in

         any manner, provide that a constitutional authority can exercise its

         powers under the Constitution arbitrarily. This necessarily implies

         that the withholding of assent underArticle 201is to be

         accompanied by the furnishing of reasons for such withholding. We

         cannot say for a moment that the President would be allowed to not

         exercise the proviso toArticle 201and not communicate reasons

         for the withholding of assent to the State legislature, as doing so

         would make the very inclusion of the proviso inArticle 200W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 398 of 414redundant. Thus, the proviso toArticle 201could be said to attach

         with the option of withholding of assent.
(XIX)    The position of law is settled that even where no time-limit is

         prescribed for the exercise of any power under a statute, it should

         be exercised within a reasonable time. The exercise of powers by

         the President underArticle 201cannot be said to be immune to this

         general principle of law. Keeping in mind the expedient nature of

         the provision and having regard to the reports of Sarkaria and

         Puncchi Commissions, as well as the Memorandum dated

         04.02.2016 issued by the Ministry of Home Affairs, we prescribe

         that the President is required to take a decision on the bills reserved

         for his consideration by the Governor within a period of three

         months from the date on which such reference is received. In case

         of any delay beyond this period, appropriate reasons would have to

         be recorded and conveyed to the concerned State.
(XX)     Whenever, in exercise of the powers underArticle 200of the

         Constitution, a bill is reserved for the consideration of the President

         on grounds of patent unconstitutionality that are of such a nature so

         as to cause peril to the principles of representative democracy, the

         President, must be guided by the fact that it is the constitutionalW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 399 of 414courts which have been entrusted with the responsibility of

         adjudicating upon the questions of constitutionality and legality of

         an executive or legislative action. Therefore, as a measure of

         prudence, the President ought to make a reference to this Court in

         exercise of his powers underArticle 143of the Constitution.



(XXI)    Judicial review and justiciability are not synonymous concepts. The

         power of judicial review in a written constitution is implicit. Unless

         expressly excluded by a provision of the Constitution, the power of

         judicial review is available in respect of exercise of powers under

         any of the provisions of the Constitution. On the other hand,

         justiciability relates to a particular field falling within the purview

         of the power of judicial review.
(XXII) The determining factor in deciding whether a power would be

         subject to judicial review is the subject-matter of such power and

         not its source.Indra Sawhney(supra) observed that the yardstick

         of subjecting an act or a decision to judicial review is not whether

         it is a legislative act or an executive decision on a policy matter but

         whether it violates any constitutional guarantee or the rights under

         Part III of the Constitution. The Governor, wherever he acts in hisW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 400 of 414discretion under the Constitution, does so by virtue of his position

         as the constitutional and formal head of the State. It has been held

         in a catena of decisions that exercise of any power under the

         Constitution must conform to the limits set by the Constitution

         itself.Article 200is no exception to this general rule.(XXIII) In light of this, the observations made by this Court inHoechst(supra) that the assent of the President is non-justiciable, cannot be

         stretched to mean that as a general rule, the exercise of powers by

         the Governor underArticle 200in his discretion would also be

         immune from judicial review. While grant of assent by the

         Governor or the President, being acts which are generally taken

         upon the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers, may not be

         justiciable, the withholding of assent or reservation of bills for the

         consideration of the President by the Governor in exercise of his

         discretion which is subject to the limits defined by the Constitution,

         would be justiciable on the touchstone of judicially determinable

         standards.
(XXIV) We summarise our findings on judicial review of the exercise of

         power by the Governor underArticle 200and the exercise of power

         by the President underArticle 201as follows:
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 401 of 414
This question being purely of a legal nature would be

                     completely justiciable and the competent court would

                     be, after a proper adjudication, fully authorized to

                     approve or disapprove of such reservation by the

                     Governor. If such a challenge finds favour with the

                     competent    court,   then,   subject    to     any    otherW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                          Page 402 of 414considerations, it would be a fit case for the issuance of

                     a writ in the nature of mandamus to the Governor for

                     appropriate action. If, however, the challenge should

                     fail then the mechanism envisaged underArticle 201of

                     the Constitution will spring into action.

(ii)     Where the reservation is on account of the bill attracting

                     any provision of the Constitution wherein the assent of

                     the President is a condition precedent for the proper

                     enactment and enforceability of such a bill as a law

                     (such as under Article 364A2) or for the purpose of

                     securing any immunity (such as underArticle 31A) or

                     overcoming any repugnancy that may exist qua a

                     Central Legislation (underArticle 254(2)), then the

                     Governor is expected to make a specific and clear

                     reference to the President properly indicating the

                     reasons for such reservation and inviting his attention as

                     described in Kaiser-I-Hind (supra). Such a reservation

                     can be assailed by the State Government, if the

                     reference made by the Governor either fails to indicate

                     the reasons for such reservation as discussed above or

                     that the reasons indicated are wholly irrelevant, mala-W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 403 of 414fide, arbitrary, unnecessary or motivated by extraneous

                     considerations. Then such a reservation would be liable

                     to be set aside. This question being purely of a legal

                     nature would be completely justiciable and the

                     competent court would be after a proper adjudication

                     fully authorized to approve or disapprove of such

                     reservation by the Governor. If such a challenge finds

                     favour with the competent court, then, subject to any

                     other considerations, it would be fit case for issuance of

                     a writ in the nature of mandamus to the Governor for

                     appropriate action. If however, the challenge should fail

                     then the mechanism envisaged underArticle 201of the

                     Constitution will spring into action.

(iii)    Where the reservation of a bill by the Governor for the

                     consideration of the President is on the grounds of peril

                     to democracy or democratic principles or on other

                     exceptional grounds as mentioned in M.P. Special

                     Police (supra) and Nabam Rebia (supra) then the

                     Governor would be expected to make a specific and

                     clear reference to the President properly indicating the

                     reasons for entertaining such a belief by pinpointing theW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 404 of 414specific provisions in this regard and the consequent

                     effect that may ensue if such a bill were to be allowed

                     to become a law. The Governor while making such a

                     reference should also indicate his subjective satisfaction

                     as to why the aforesaid consequences that may ensue

                     cannot be possibly curtailed or contained by taking

                     recourse to the constitutional courts of the country. It

                     shall be open to the State Government to challenge such

                     a reservation on the ground of failure on part of the

                     Governor to furnish the necessary reasons as discussed

                     aforesaid or that the reasons indicated are wholly

                     irrelevant,   mala-fide,   arbitrary,   unnecessary    or

                     motivated by extraneous considerations. This being a

                     question completely capable of being determined by the

                     constitutional courts, would be fully justiciable.
(iv)     Reservation of a bill on grounds other than the ones

                     mentioned above, such as personal dissatisfaction of the

                     Governor, political expediency or any other extraneous

                     or irrelevant considerations is strictly impermissible by

                     the Constitution and would be liable to be set-aside

                     forthwith on that ground alone. This will alsoW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 405 of 414encompass reservation of a bill by the Governor after

                     having already exercised the option of withholding of

                     assent in terms ofArticle 200except in such exceptional

                     circumstance as mentioned in paragraph 204 of this

                     judgment.

(v)      Where the Governor exhibits inaction in making a

                     decision when a bill is presented to him for assent underArticle 200and such inaction exceeds the time-limit as

                     has been prescribed by us in paragraph 250 of this

                     judgment then it shall be open to the State Government

                     to seek a writ of mandamus from a competent court

                     against the Governor directing expeditious decision on

                     the concerned bill as is the mandate of the Constitution,

                     however, it is clarified that the Governor may

                     successfully resist such a challenge on providing

                     sufficient explanation for the delay caused.
b. Where the Governor reserves a bill for the consideration of the

            President and the President in turn withholds assent thereto then,

            it shall be open to the State Government to assail such an action

            before this Court. Such a challenge can broadly be made on the

            following grounds:
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                      Page 406 of 414
435. For all the foregoing reasons we have reached the following conclusion:
436. We are in no way undermining the office of the Governor. All we say is that

     the Governor must act with due deference to the settled conventions of

     parliamentary democracy; respecting the will of the people being expressed

     through the legislature as-well as the elected government responsible to the

     people. He must perform his role of a friend, philosopher and guide with

     dispassion, guided not by considerations of political expediency but by the

     sanctity of the constitutional oath he undertakes. In times of conflict, he must

     be the harbinger of consensus and resolution, lubricating the functioning of

     the State machinery by his sagacity, wisdom and not run it into a standstill.

     He must be the catalyst and not an inhibitor. All his actions must be impelled

     keeping in mind the dignity of the high constitutional office that he occupies.W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 409 of 414
437. The Governor before he assumes office undertakes an oath to discharge his

    functions to the best of his ability in order to preserve, protect and defend

    the Constitution and the rule of law, along with avowing to devote himself

    to the service and well-being of the people of the State. Therefore, it is

    imperative that all his actions be guided in true allegiance to his oath and

    that he faithfully executes his functions that he is entrusted with by and under

    the Constitution. There is a reason why a specific reference is made to the

    well-being of the people of the State in his oath, there is a reason why he is

    sworn in to pledge himself to the service of the same people; the Governor

    as the constitutional head of the State is reposed with the responsibility to

    accord primacy to the will and welfare of the people of the State and

    earnestly work in harmony with the State machinery, as his oath not only

    makes this mandate anything but clear but rather also demands it of the

    Governor owing to the intimate and delicate nature of the functions that he

    performs and the potency of the ramifications that could ensue or be

    unleashed upon the State. Due to this, the Governor must be conscious to

    not create roadblocks or chokehold the State Legislature in order to thwart

    and trade the will of the people for political edge. The members of the State

    Legislature having been elected by the people of the State as an outcome of

    the democratic expression are better attuned to ensure the wellbeing of the

    people of the State. Hence, any action contrary to the express choice of theW.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                        Page 410 of 414people, in other words, the State legislature would be a renege of his

    constitutional oath.

438. Before we part with the matter, we find it apposite to observe that

    constitutional authorities occupying high offices must be guided by the

    values of the Constitution. These values that are so cherished by the people

    of India are a result of years of struggle and sacrifice of our forefathers.

    When called upon to take decisions, such authorities must not give in to

    ephemeral political considerations but rather be guided by the spirit that

    underlies the Constitution. They must look within and reflect whether their

    actions are informed by their constitutional oath and if the course of action

    adopted by them furthers the ideals enshrined in the Constitution. If the

    authorities attempt to deliberately bypass the constitutional mandate, they

    are tinkering with the very ideals revered by its people upon which this

    country has been built.

439. We take this opportunity to quote Dr. B.R. Ambedkar’s concluding speech

    in the Constituent Assembly, which is as relevant today as it was in 1949 –

    “However good a Constitution may be, it is sure to turn out bad because

    those who are called to work it, happen to be a bad lot. However bad a

    Constitution may be, it may turn out to be good if those who are called to

    work it, happen to be a good lot”.
W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                     Page 411 of 414
440. It is our duty as the highest constitutional court to recognize such evil and

     increasingly strengthen our initiative to remove them. In the last, we may

     say with the utmost responsibility and all the humility at our command that

     it is only when the constitutional functionaries exercise their powers by and

     under the Constitution that they show deference to the people of India who

     have given the Constitution to themselves.

441. The soul of India is its Constitution. Our Republic, the foresight of dynamic

     visionaries. What a great edifice, they built, ensuring sovereignty with

     democratic values. The Constitution is our bedrock ensuring our safety and

     security. It outlines a process that keeps us rooted in values. We read it for

     reference and for every policy decision. Without it, we would be lost and

     make many mistakes. It is now seventy-five years old, but we still keep

     turning to it, why? Because it guarantees our rights and sets benchmarks for

     our responsibilities. The laws and rules that uplift all people sprout from its

     pristine womb, welfare of all is its primary concern, but its sanctity and

     safety should be our prime concern.

442. We would also like to refer to a snippet of history from the days of infancy

     of the Constitution and the Indian Republic, which has been narrated in the

     “Eminent Parliamentarians Monograph Series on Dr. Rajendra Prasad”W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023                                       Page 412 of 414published by the Lok Sabha Secretariat in 1990 (pp. 102). In the matter

    concerning the constitutional role of the President in legislative processes,

    an issue arose during the deliberations on the Hindu Code Bill, wherein the

    first President of India, Dr. Rajendra Prasad, expressed reservations and

    sought to assert his independent authority to withhold assent to the

    legislation. A reference was made to the first Attorney General for India,

    M.C. Setalvad, who clarified that the role of the President under the Indian

    Constitution was analogous to that of the British monarch and he was

    expected to serve as a constitutional figurehead. The Attorney General

    opined that the President does not possess the authority to act contrary to the

    advice of the Council of Ministers. The opinion of the Attorney General was,

    with respect and magnanimity, accepted by the President and thus the

    ensuing controversy between the Prime Minister and the President was laid

    to rest.

443. Such was the commitment shown by the stalwarts to upholding the spirit of

    the Constitution.

444. We hope and trust that the Governor and the State Government would work

    in tandem and harmoniously keeping the interests and well-being of the

    people as their paramount consideration.

445. We direct the Registry to send one copy each of this judgment to all the High

     Courts and the Principal Secretaries to the Governors of all States.
446. In the result, the present writ petition stands disposed of in the aforesaid

     terms.

447. Pending application(s), if any, stand disposed of.
